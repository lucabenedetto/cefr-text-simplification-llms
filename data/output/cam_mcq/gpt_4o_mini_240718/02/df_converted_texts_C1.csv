1,"Some time ago, a website discussed the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The website's message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""I’m at this place,"" you are also revealing your location to many people, not all of whom you would want to meet. This highlights a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative consequences. The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to wealth and fame. However, as we share personal stories and photos, we may find ourselves in a crowded and risky environment.

This situation may seem discouraging, but there is hope. The future has been mapped out for us by early internet pioneers. In the beginning, these individuals explored the internet and identified its dangers. They faced job losses, friendship changes, and the challenges of fame long before social media existed. These early bloggers experienced what many of us are now going through. It is important to learn from their experiences, as those who do not learn from history are likely to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the World Wide Web, which was mainly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography filled with links, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was open; anyone who crossed his path could be featured on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some may see this as exhibitionism, there was also a unique beauty to his work.

However, one day, visitors to Hall’s site found it replaced by a single, emotional video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog was removed, but the issue remains. Sharing online can be enjoyable, but if you think it will make people want to be around you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers studying online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once a cautionary tale of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life in a thoughtful way. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, that doesn’t mean we should."
2,"Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This film mixes documentary and drama to suggest that there is much we do not understand about our universe. While scientists can sometimes be arrogant, even the most confident physicist would not claim to know everything about the cosmos. However, some scientists felt it was necessary to publicly criticize the film, calling it everything from ""atrocious"" to ""very dangerous."" This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I didn’t understand the controversy. The film featured various scientists making harmless statements about how new discoveries are showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It was only when the film discussed specific discoveries that I began to understand the concern—like the claim that water molecules can be influenced by human thoughts. I had heard about a Japanese researcher who suggested that the shape of water molecules could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the film only provided images of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to positively and unattractive after being exposed to negative emotions. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is simple and easy to understand. But scientists typically respond with skepticism, saying, ""Give me a break."" 

I understand their point. The idea that thoughts can affect water is fascinating and suggests new forces in the universe. However, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Beautiful pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that could be driving the expansion of the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research from laboratories and observatories worldwide.

In reality, discoveries are being made that confirm the film's claim that the universe is much stranger than we ever imagined. Astronomers have discovered that the universe contains an unknown type of matter and is expanding due to a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Additionally, researchers in other fields are making remarkable discoveries. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay we do not notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have located the origin of modern humans and understand how and why they spread across the globe. Some theorists even suggest connections between life on Earth and the fundamental structure of the universe.

Despite what some may think, science is far from complete. In fact, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever before. Many natural phenomena may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that there are limits to our knowledge. This has led some of the world's top theoretical physicists to work on a ""Theory of Everything,"" which aims to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with a single equation. Ultimately, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"To put it simply, I find writing novels challenging, while writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. Both processes work together to create a beautiful landscape that I cherish. The trees provide shade, and the wind rustles their leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the gentle change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a set of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while creating short stories. These two types of writing likely engage different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. At that time, I knew little about writing short stories, so it was challenging, but I found the experience memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of my writing. One of my early works, “Breaking Waves,” was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my beginning as a short-story writer.

One of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to complete. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can go on forever). This is different from the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. When I write a novel, it can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I will finish. Therefore, writing short stories provides a necessary change of pace.

Another great thing about short stories is that you can create them from the smallest ideas—like a thought, a word, or an image. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, where the story leads me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry too much about failure. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This thought comforts me. You can learn from your mistakes and apply that knowledge to your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both my successes and failures in short stories. In this way, short stories serve as a kind of experimental space for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment the way I want to within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more challenging.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, gentle reminders of my feelings at the time of writing them. They guide me and bring me joy as a writer, allowing me to share these personal emotions with my readers."
4,"At its core, science is closely related to philosophy, but it also has practical applications, such as curing diseases. Science has improved our lives but also poses risks. It seeks to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, yet it often struggles to do so. Science influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often recognized only by those who study it deeply, while its dangers are frequently misunderstood. The significance of science has been both exaggerated and underestimated, and its mistakes, as well as those of its practitioners, are often overlooked or unfairly highlighted.

The history of science is marked by constant conflict. Established theories are frequently revised or completely rejected, similar to how new music styles are initially mocked before becoming accepted. This battle between old and new ideas is rarely respectful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. The history of science is fundamentally about conflict. This book will explore scientific ideas that have transformed not just science, but also many areas of human thought. While science has practical uses, our main focus will be on its ideas—their beauty and the limitations of human understanding.

Science is inherently changeable. There is always a scientist challenging the ideas of another. Most of the time, these changes do not disrupt society. However, sometimes they can lead to significant shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the seventeenth century, science introduced the idea of a mechanical universe, like a giant clock. Three hundred years later, physics began to question basic assumptions, leading us to a complex understanding where our observations can influence the universe, and we struggle to grasp the true meaning of fundamental concepts.

Some people view the instability of scientific theories as a sign that science cannot explain the universe. However, scientific changes usually enhance our ability to understand and predict natural phenomena. For instance, Isaac Newton could explain much more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein advanced our understanding even further. Science may falter, but it continues to progress. 

At the end of the nineteenth century, many physicists believed there was little left to discover in their field. Then came groundbreaking discoveries like radioactivity, X-rays, the electron, and many more. Biology has also made significant advancements. Today, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything,"" a complete understanding of the universe's origins and workings. 

Science is not just an academic exercise. Over the last two centuries, we have shifted from merely observing nature to influencing it, sometimes disrupting its balance in ways we do not fully understand. It is crucial for non-scientists to engage with scientific advancements, as these developments will shape the world their children will live in. Science is now a key part of how humanity envisions and shapes its future. The implications of scientific progress can impact everything from government budgets to the health of future generations and the long-term survival of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had either leveled off or even decreased in some cases. This raised new doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can coexist, the debate about whether ebooks will replace print books continues. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this possibility, the idea of books disappearing still sparks our imagination and leads to intense discussions. 

Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the notion of one medium replacing another often arises with new technologies. Even before digital technology, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many believed radio would disappear. However, radio adapted and found new ways to be used, such as in cars and factories. 

The idea that books might disappear is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated itself many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been thought to threaten print books as sources of culture and entertainment. Some argued that the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks in a hopeful digital future. 

The idea of the death of the book often arises during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our mixed feelings about technology, combining hope and fear. To understand why these feelings are so common, we must recognize that we form emotional connections with different media as they become part of our lives. Many studies show that we develop strong attachments to objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or expressing frustration at our laptops. 

When new technology, like e-readers, emerges, it not only signals economic and social change but also forces us to rethink our relationship with something that has become essential in our daily lives. As technology evolves, we often find ourselves missing what we once knew but no longer have. This longing is why industries often form around retro products and older technologies. For instance, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe led people to seek out original manuscripts. The transition from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older format. The same occurred with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. 

E-readers have also sparked a renewed appreciation for the physical qualities of traditional books, even their unique smell. This should reassure those who worry about the decline of print books. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be an attractive story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we cope with change is by using familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and endings. These narratives are easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 AM. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I focused on the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers. The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I would say, “Tell me what time you eat and if you take a nap afterward.” In this way, my book is somewhat superficial. It looks at the conditions for creativity rather than the creative work itself. However, it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about the writer’s inner self, and I agree.

The main questions I explore in this book are ones I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work on many things a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep, income, or a tidy home, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions definitively—some may only be resolved through personal compromise—but I provide examples of how many successful people have dealt with similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas can be broken down into small daily actions and how our habits affect our work and vice versa.

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. Routines can seem ordinary and thoughtless, like being on autopilot. However, a good routine can help you use limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism effectively. A strong routine creates a path for your mental energy and helps you manage your moods. The psychologist William James believed that putting parts of your life on autopilot through good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule.

Interestingly, it was a moment of procrastination that inspired this book. One Sunday afternoon, while working at a small architecture magazine, I was supposed to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself cleaning my workspace and making coffee. As a morning person, I can concentrate well in the early hours but struggle in the afternoon. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many entertaining stories and thought it would be great to collect them, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was informal; I shared people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I have gathered a much larger and better-researched collection while trying to keep the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I must acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. On a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of his university studies, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He became more interested in the very beginnings of life, rather than the more famous periods like the Jurassic and dinosaurs. He focused on studying small, delicate creatures found in grey rocks.

As he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would find a job, especially in the type of institution he wanted. He had confidence in his abilities, but he knew that deserving candidates do not always get jobs. When an Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London opened up, he applied, though he did not expect much.

On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and a colleague who did not like Howard’s original professor took his place. This colleague was able to help Howard get the job. Howard was surprised by this unexpected support and felt grateful, but later learned the true reason behind it. Although it would have been nice to think he was chosen for his skills, what mattered most was that he had the job and could do the work he loved.

Howard often compared his orderly professional life, where he could plan and pursue scientific truth, with the chaos of personal life. He realized that many people could affect his life, sometimes in unexpected ways. For example, when his briefcase, containing notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station, he was very upset. He returned to college, called to postpone the lecture, and reported the theft. Afterward, he went for a coffee and met a colleague who was hosting a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. During this meeting, Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied, which would become his biggest challenge and secure his future in his profession. If it weren’t for the theft and that kind stranger, he might not have discovered this opportunity. Within half an hour, he changed his plans. He decided not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is open to trying many different foods. He mentions that he has ice cream made from bee larvae at home, which may look unusual but supposedly tastes ""slightly nutty and floral."" One of Spence's goals is to make eating insects more acceptable. As a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, he studies how our senses work together to shape our experience of taste. His research influences what we eat and drink, from large food companies to high-end restaurant menus.

Spence and his colleagues explore a field called gastro physics, which examines how various factors affect our food experience. For example, who we eat with, how food is presented, the colors and textures of plates and utensils, and even background noise can all change how we perceive taste. In his book, *The Perfect Meal*, co-authored with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, Spence shares interesting findings, such as how the first person to order in a group tends to enjoy their meal more. He also notes that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person and 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab is quite simple, filled with basic equipment. He has soundproof booths and older audio-visual tools. By keeping costs low, he can collaborate creatively with chefs who may not have the budget for academic research. Much of his funding comes from a large food company. He explains that in the past, research funded by the industry was often looked down upon in universities. However, since the government now requires universities to show their work has real-world impact, this type of research has become more accepted.

Currently, Spence is assisting well-known brands in reducing salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Interestingly, many companies make these changes quietly, so consumers do not notice the difference. Spence explains that when people are informed about these changes, they tend to focus more on the taste and often find it less enjoyable.

Spence first met the famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a major food company. At that time, many people thought combining science and food was unappealing, even though food is inherently scientific. Blumenthal's collaboration with Spence led to the creation of the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in his restaurant. Spence points out that similar ideas were explored by early 20th-century Italian futurists, but they did not gain popularity.

Today, the food industry is increasingly applying Spence's research on sensory experiences. For instance, he has found that higher-pitched music can enhance sweetness, while lower-pitched sounds can make food taste bitter. An airline is planning to match music with the meals served to passengers, and a well-known brand recently launched an app that plays music while ice cream melts, although they did not match the music to the taste.

At home, Spence's dinner parties can be quite unique. He recalls a time when they served rabbit with the fur still on the cutlery, and another time when they experimented with colored lights. They have even hosted parties with tone generators and headphones to test different drinks. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his research lab."
9,"Our brains are more active than ever. We are overwhelmed with facts, false information, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information. We must sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we handle most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage the responsibilities of many different roles while keeping up with our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every free moment. 

However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking—doing several things at once—this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, we lose some mental efficiency. Instead of being expert jugglers, we are more like amateur plate spinners, hurriedly moving from one task to another, worried that the tasks we are not focusing on will fall apart. 

Ironically, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases the production of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can overstimulate our brains and lead to confusion. Multitasking creates a craving for constant stimulation, rewarding our brains for losing focus. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we rely on to stay focused, is easily distracted by new things, similar to how shiny objects attract infants. 

Just the chance to multitask can harm our cognitive performance. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this problem ""info-mania."" His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an unread email is waiting can lower our effective IQ by nearly 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by tiredness. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning new information while multitasking sends that information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information from their studies goes to a part of the brain that stores skills, rather than to the part that organizes facts and ideas. Without distractions, the information is stored in a way that makes it easier to remember.

Moreover, multitasking often involves making decisions: ""Should I reply to this text or ignore it? How should I respond?"" Decision-making is also taxing for our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can become mentally exhausted and may make poor choices about important matters.

In discussions about information overload with business leaders and scientists, email is frequently mentioned as a problem. It is not that email itself is the issue, but rather the overwhelming amount of communication we receive. When asked what his father does for a living, the 10-year-old son of a neuroscience colleague replied, ""He answers emails."" This reflects a common reality: we feel we must respond to emails, but it often feels impossible to do so while accomplishing anything else."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he acting out of spite? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they struggle to give birth. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, such questions were often ignored. Animals were seen as having behaviors that led to measurable results, and science focused on those results. The idea that animals have consciousness, feelings, and moral systems was considered sentimental and unscientific. However, this view has started to change. Research on the behavior of bats, chimpanzees, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions, an area that was once avoided. This shift has influenced popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". 

This change has sparked a debate that may never be fully resolved: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another important question about conscience, which is a person's sense of right and wrong that guides their actions. In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more joy—by jumping and kicking—than those that had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we produce and consume beef? While the observations are clear, their interpretation is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" argues that the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the brink of a major ethical revolution, similar to the abolition of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, suggests we should reconsider our understanding of animal intelligence, proposing that animals have a simpler theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail believes we should avoid attributing human emotions to animals. These three perspectives may never agree because the core issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks?

Balcombe describes a significant experiment he conducted that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can experience depression. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other lived in small, bare cages. Initially, both groups learned to eat only from a box with tasty worms. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a poor environment made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights organizations, has a clear bias. He states, “We look back with horror at a time of racism. Our views on animals will eventually be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” 

If Balcombe were the only one advocating for this view of animal consciousness, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He notes, “What we are witnessing is a swing of the pendulum. In the early 20th century, some believed animals thought like us, and there was a backlash against that idea. Now we are moving back in that direction. But this is a contentious topic, and it’s important to listen carefully to academics with strong opinions.”"
11,"Critical thinking is a way to engage with what we read or hear to gain a deeper understanding. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., notes that many believe arguing helps us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are growing worries that it also changes how we tackle complex problems, making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but appealing ideas, trends, and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Surprisingly, having more data does not necessarily lead to better knowledge or decision-making. West highlights that the quality of our thinking has not improved much despite the increase in information.

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading has dropped by 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that the rise of visual media has a cost. She argues that less reading may lead to weaker critical thinking skills, as people focus more on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one task.

However, we still do not have a clear answer on how technology impacts critical thinking. The presence of technology has complicated our understanding, and scholars can no longer depend on previous beliefs. It is tempting to see computers, video games, and the internet as either entirely good or bad, but the truth is more complex. Different technologies can have different effects. For instance, a computer game might encourage critical thinking or hinder it. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links may prevent deeper thinking.

Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how we think. She observes that reading fosters imagination and critical thinking in ways that visual media, like video games and television, do not. Reading helps develop imagination, reflection, and vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can enhance some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are fast-paced and do not allow time for reflection or analysis. As a result, many people, especially younger individuals, may not reach their full potential.

Society's view of technology greatly influences how we perceive critical thinking. This is especially clear in the debate over video games and their impact on thinking. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games are often misunderstood. While many believe they are harmful to children, he claims they can be valuable learning tools. Evidence suggests that video games can help develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging, realistic environments. These games also allow players to explore ideas that might otherwise be difficult to access.

In our digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it is important to examine technology closely and understand how it affects our thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the value of manual trades, while his latest book discusses how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on a credit card machine during a brief moment of waiting. Crawford realized that these distractions are becoming harder to escape. What we want to focus on at any moment is personal, but we often cannot choose this for ourselves because of things we usually do not notice. It is increasingly difficult to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, we tend to isolate ourselves and stop doing simple things like talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we often experience the world through representations designed to capture our attention, such as video games and apps, which can manipulate our desires and take control of our lives.

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many office workers complain about emails but then spend their free time checking them. Research shows that our attention can wander if a phone is simply visible nearby. Although there is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, people have worried about this since the invention of the telegraph in 1837. What is clear is that we are more aware of other activities we could be doing. While it is easy to blame technology for this issue, Crawford believes that technology has created perfect tools for our self-obsession. Living in a world of endless choices makes it hard to control ourselves, which affects our social interactions. We often prefer to text friends instead of having face-to-face conversations. By only interacting with representations of people rather than real people, Crawford argues that we risk losing something essential in our society.

Screens are not the only problem. Crawford uses his gym as an example. In the past, there was one music player in the center of the room that everyone could use. People had different music tastes, which sometimes caused tension. Now, most people listen to their own music through earbuds. “The gym used to be a social place, but it has lost that quality,” he says. Real connections with others often happen through conflict, like discussing different music preferences.

Crawford suggests a two-part solution. First, we need to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world in a more fulfilling way. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people whose jobs require them to interact with reality. No representation can match the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under your tires. These roles depend on good judgment and the ability to manage interactions with others.

“When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences seem less satisfying compared to real experiences,” he explains. This does not mean everyone should become a chef; rather, it is important to find ways to use your judgment. There are many benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, practicing attention on one thing can help you pay attention to other things more easily."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, as a philosopher, I find it a bit more complicated. Calling myself a philosopher can sound pretentious. It’s acceptable to say I study or teach philosophy, but saying I am a philosopher might suggest I claim to know some special truth. This idea is misleading; philosophers are just like everyone else. 

So, why do people have this stereotype of philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who evaluate the actions of others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical thinking, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers fully agree with this, philosophy is still often linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting what society says can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to reflect on the world helps us take control of our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life doesn’t require extensive reading of philosophical texts or a life focused solely on intellectual thought. It simply means paying closer attention to our daily experiences to ensure they are meaningful. You don’t have to be a wise person living apart from society to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is key to a good life.

Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more disconnected from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This isn’t entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and reputation are often linked to expensive academic journals, making it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. As a result, philosophy can seem distant from everyday life. While some philosophers have tried to challenge this view, many have accepted it. The academic environment has led to a kind of isolation, and as discussions have become more technical, it has become difficult for those outside the field to understand them.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work focuses on ethics, which is the area of philosophy that examines human actions. Recently, I’ve felt that this title doesn’t fully capture my work, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and values. There is a new trend in philosophy where ethics is seen as applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of specific social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ethical or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading movies is unethical (it is) and then move on to deeper questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy encourages people to examine the practices and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes this examination confirms what we already know; other times, it reveals that our beliefs are difficult to defend. Regardless, by reflecting on these ideas, we contribute to the benefit of everyone."
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and anyone who enjoys food might think that thinking critically about what and how we eat can enhance our enjoyment of food. However, historically, discussions about food in philosophy have often been secondary to other philosophical topics. When philosophers discuss eating, it often serves as a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, conversations that seem to be about food actually explore deeper, but only loosely related, ideas.

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who promoted the idea of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain across various aspects of life. Despite this, Epicurus is often associated with a love for eating and drinking, as seen in restaurant names and food-related websites. Businesses likely hope to benefit from this association with a well-known philosopher.

Food is inherently social and cultural. The food we eat comes from historical contexts and is shared within our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions and the systems through which food is produced and distributed. We interact with food more often and in more significant ways than with any other product, making it a clear subject for philosophical exploration.

Once food is prepared, critics begin to discuss and write about it. But why do these critics hold such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, influential food critics are simply better at describing flavors. This area has been overlooked in philosophy, as most studies on perception focus on vision, which should change.

Another important aspect of food is its aesthetics. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers argue that, with the growth of modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in discussions about beauty alongside art forms like sculpture and poetry. However, food is consumed in the process of enjoyment, unlike visual or auditory art, which can be appreciated over time. Therefore, it is incorrect to consider food a proper subject of aesthetic value.

There are also many ethical questions related to food. We often ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will question why we hold these beliefs, making such discussions about food worthwhile.

Additionally, there is a difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, as they share food and companionship with loved ones. In contrast, professional cooks have obligations to their employers and the food itself, meaning their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more about colleagues than friends.

A recent essay titled ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" explores how food and dining can help bridge cultural divides. This happens in two ways: first, by learning to appreciate others' food, and second, by building personal connections through shared meals, a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The essay is filled with engaging examples and stories that bring this aspect of food philosophy to life for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the United States, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he enjoyed as a child were no longer fun or challenging, so he began to think about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a storyline and if choices made in one game could affect future games. He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and players’ long-standing rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Daviau was later invited to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy received great praise, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (from the 16th to the mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story coherent. To do this, they use testers to see how the games play out. Jaime Barriga, a play-tester for SeaFall, said, “It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games go well, but then after a few more, it can start to fall apart, and you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was developing the idea, he thought it would appeal to a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was different and pretty good, but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I expected it to be successful with just a few people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest advancements in game design in recent years. He said, “It brings a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than learning a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of an unfolding story outweighed any worries about the game’s longevity. He mentioned, “At first, I was worried about making changes and possibly ruining my board. But that concern was eased by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice in the cinema, right? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling aspect similar to video games.” The legacy format is influenced not only by video games but also by the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but ended up in advertising and then game design. Still, he loved storytelling.

Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compares the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but just having an outline is not enough.” While Daviau feels a sense of ownership over the idea, he is curious to see how others will develop it. However, he also tries to downplay its importance, thinking that gamers will soon ask, “What’s next?” Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less certain. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,"Not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like something from a children’s movie, became popular online. Part of the enjoyment comes from seeing animals as similar to us. Octopuses are particularly fascinating because they are very intelligent and have bodies that are very different from ours. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways.

Some people think that comparing animals to humans is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually a mistake to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this mistake ""anthropodenial."" After studying many years of research on animal intelligence, he argues that animals show many behaviors that we once thought were unique to humans, such as remembering the past and future, feeling empathy, and understanding the intentions of others. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often believe.

De Waal thinks that anthropodenial is a recent trend. In medieval and early modern Europe, people believed that animals were intelligent enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed our understanding of evolution, wrote that the difference between human minds and those of higher animals is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, the rise of behaviorism, which focused on training animals through rewards and punishments, changed how people viewed animal intelligence. For much of that century, animals were seen as simple machines or robots with instincts. Those who believed animals had inner lives were often dismissed as unrealistic. This change in thinking coincided with a time when humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly.

Fortunately, de Waal believes we are starting to recognize that animal intelligence exists on a similar spectrum to human intelligence. He notes that there has been a surge of knowledge about animal cognition in recent years, especially shared online. He argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits and skills of each species. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid their nuts, something we often struggle with.

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might focus on how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, the octopus might think we are not very smart.

De Waal is cautious about Inky’s escape. While other octopuses have escaped before, he believes it is overly optimistic to think Inky intentionally found a way to the ocean. However, he understands how powerful stories like Inky’s can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers and others received grapes, the ones with cucumbers became upset when they saw their peers getting the better treat. The study was published in a scientific journal, but what really made people believe the findings was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our understanding of animal minds continues to evolve."
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once a topic in science fiction, is now set to cause major changes in technology, similar to the impact of industrialisation. While robots have been used in car manufacturing and other industries for many years, experts believe we are on the verge of a significant increase in robot use across various fields. Many people see robotic automation as a disruptive force. Interestingly, about two-thirds of people think that robots will take over most jobs currently done by humans in the next 50 years. However, around 80% believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not: every industry will feel the effects of robotic automation soon.

For instance, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X, which can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This task would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is Tally, a robot from a San Francisco startup, which checks supermarket shelves to ensure products are stocked and priced correctly, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation argue that robots currently cannot maintain or program themselves, which could lead to new, skilled jobs for technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not underestimate the importance of human interaction in the workplace. They believe society is unprepared for the changes that reducing human contact will bring.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics applications, studies how robotics is changing the workforce. His recent report indicates that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work alongside humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field are expected to rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers.

Zhang emphasizes that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes that instead of relying on the government to protect their jobs, these workers should seek retraining opportunities. The idea of staying in the same job for life is no longer realistic.

Additionally, advancements in motion control, sensors, and artificial intelligence will lead to new types of robots for consumers, including humanoid robots that can live and interact with us in our homes. This presents a unique opportunity for companies ready to embrace these changes, but it also brings challenges, such as the need for new regulations to ensure safety and privacy.

With millions of jobs at risk and a potential global employment crisis, it is crucial to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce shaped by robotics. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"The mountaineer George Mallory is famously quoted as saying he wanted to climb Mount Everest ""because it’s there."" This response reflects a common question people have: why would anyone risk their life to climb a mountain? Mallory's answer might encourage some to pursue their dreams, as it suggests that adventure and fun can be enough motivation for climbing.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He identified seven different types of climbing activities, from bouldering to climbing high peaks, each with its own rules. He argued that the approach to each climb, such as the amount of equipment used, should depend on the specific rules of that activity. This perspective has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in magazines and casual conversations.

Many climbers love the sense of freedom that climbing provides. However, climbing can also feel restrictive. For instance, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox: while climbing can limit options, it can also simplify life, which some may see as a form of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective in his recent essay. He suggests that instead of asking ""Why climb?"" we should ask ""Why do people climb?"" This shifts the focus to human nature and suggests that climbing is part of our evolution. It is in our nature to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing may be more about our biology than logical reasoning.

Another important viewpoint comes from US academic Brian Treanor, who argues that climbing can help develop virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While he acknowledges that not all climbers show these traits, he believes they are especially important in today's risk-averse society. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits by helping people develop qualities that contribute to a fulfilling life.

Additionally, some believe that climbers who rely solely on themselves and not on technology must be fully committed to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson stirred debate by claiming that climbs done independently are more challenging and deserve more recognition than those completed with teams or artificial aids, like bottled oxygen. This view raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Exploring climbing outside the Western perspective reveals that climbers often experience being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, the meditative state while climbing, and intuitive problem-solving are key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques resemble those in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of peace. This idea adds another layer to the question of why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Over the past sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel has established a strong presence in classical music. He was known for his intellectual and sometimes serious nature, focusing on important European piano works. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he taught very few students. Those close to him saw a playful side, but this was rarely shown during his concerts. His life was a constant routine of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after one of his concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was around 14 at the time. After listening to him play, Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit played beautifully from memory, and Brendel recognized his rare talent for understanding music.

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to make his own mark, although Brendel is cautious about Kit’s future, worried he might burn out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps a close watch on him. He also composes music. Brendel emphasizes the importance of learning to read music by trying to write it yourself. He noticed Kit’s incredible memory and ability to read music quickly. Kit is also very sensitive to sound and listens carefully when Brendel explains things. He not only understands but can apply what he learns throughout a piece of music.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He gets upset when newspapers label Kit as the next great pianist of the 21st century, saying it can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit excels in some areas but still needs time and experience in others. It would be unfair for critics to expect perfection from him.

Now at 80 years old, Brendel shows a softer side in his retirement. He reflects on his youth, saying he never aimed for fame quickly but wanted to achieve certain goals by age 50. When he reached 50, he felt he had accomplished most of those goals but still wanted to do more. Although he no longer has the physical strength to perform, he continues to think about music and enjoys this new phase of his career."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandfather’s garden was by a river, sloping gently down to the water. Although you couldn’t reach the river, you could hear the water flowing and the birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and a place to escape. 

Grandad’s garden didn’t have anything special like a greenhouse, unlike some neighbors who had makeshift ones made from old window frames and patched plastic where glass had broken. At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed using phrases like “It’s immaterial to me,” even though “I don’t mind” would have worked just as well. Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once considered moving to Canada, but it never happened. 

He was skilled at home improvement, able to build bookshelves or cupboards impressively. My parents only moved house once during their marriage, but my mother was adventurous with furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. The only part I liked were the two brass candlesticks on it, which my mother said were too fancy and removed while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I later asked my mother why I wasn’t given the chance, she simply said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could let my imagination run wild there. With a fishing net over my shoulder and old sandals that barely fit, I would walk along the riverbank looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic. I would then wade into the water, hoping to catch fish to take home. After failing to keep them alive in the backyard, I returned them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but that seemed unlikely until one day my father said, “There’s a job opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.” In that moment, he went against his usual judgment. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think that deep down, he hoped things would turn out well if I pursued gardening. Even though he didn’t enjoy gardening himself, he had seen my enthusiasm for it and recognized my passion for growing plants and flowers."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is crouching on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I am doing the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the steep cliff in front of us and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, approaches, and his owner gently strokes him. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. He shows me around, pointing to nearby islands. “That’s Eigg to the north, and to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets a lot more rain than we do,” he shouts over the wind. I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s tall mountains. “Just beyond Rum is Soay,” he adds.

Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep, and we start walking down the slopes. He shares interesting facts about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide, its geese eat a lot of grass, and his family has lived here for 3,000 years. As we walk, Tie tries to herd the sheep but struggles. “Away to me, Tie,” MacEwen instructs, meaning the dog should go to the right, but Tie goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. MacEwen sounds disappointed, and Tie looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mainly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, manage the farm, their son Colin takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two sons can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out and only come back when they’re hungry,” she says. However, living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is not always available. On my first evening, I anxiously wait for the lights to come on, and the next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “You can get reception on the hill,” Mary explains, “but most people give up after a couple of days and put their phones away.” So, I do the same.

Life on Muck is full of surprises. A boat arrives today with groceries and three musicians who come to perform in the island’s tearoom. Their concert is a great success, and the locals enjoy the music. That night, as I sit by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father bought a small farm on Soay after seeing it in a newspaper, without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” I ask if Jenny knew how to run a farm. “She had good typing skills,” he replies.

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. However, I eat well, as most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish, which I bring back to her kitchen. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is incredibly delicious. The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries have been canceled recently due to rough seas. If my ferry doesn’t arrive, I might be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I wouldn’t mind at all."
22,"The game design industry was once mainly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals, and it didn't offer many ways for newcomers to enter. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now the video game industry is taken seriously. This change may surprise some, but industry experts are not surprised at all. However, breaking into this field is challenging. Creating video game spin-offs based on new movies requires many team members and months of hard work and skill.

Like many industries, getting into game design is difficult, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, explains that it is tough to make progress in large companies or to influence major games. However, the industry needs game designers more than ever, not just those at the top who manage entire projects, but also those who design specific systems and elements.

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim believes that the most important thing is to create games. He says, ""The tools are available. You won’t get hired if you haven’t made anything, and you won’t succeed on your own if you’re not creating."" Game design is more than just a job; it is a lifestyle. Like any creative work, it must be practiced to be meaningful.

Another expert, John Field, acknowledges that while ""just doing it"" is important, the situation is more complex. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry's high standards. Even fewer possess the creativity, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit needed to contribute to this evolving field.

Can you succeed on your own? John says, ""Maybe, but it’s quite difficult."" A good postgraduate course in game design can provide valuable support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in various forms of entertainment and have a strong passion for the arts and contemporary culture. They may have spent some time working after graduation but have realized that games are their true calling. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing diversity in this medium.

Networking is also important. Many people overlook this, but to advance in game design, as in many fields, building connections is essential. The stereotype of a young boy playing video games has changed. Now, video games are recognized as a serious medium that attracts a wide audience. Families often engage with interactive consoles, and smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media.

John believes there is significant potential for growth in this area. ""Games have become popular among larger audiences. They are also an excellent way to learn, and I see this already significant field as full of new possibilities and opportunities."""
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very demanding. He would always say, ""You can't do this, you can't do that."" My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest in football and has not played since. I am glad that did not happen to me, but I know it could have been different.

When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score spectacular goals by practicing. The best players in the world, who have great natural talent, still need years of practice to achieve their success. Sometimes, I see young players colliding with each other, but I was taught the right techniques. When I teach kids, I focus on helping them enjoy learning new skills.

At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I now understand the importance of a good education, but back then, football was my main focus. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that his tendency to kick the books around doesn’t mean he will be like me in that way.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could join the first team, but he never made a big fuss about it. He didn’t gather us and say, ""This is your big chance,"" but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a well-known TV presenter said, ""You can’t win anything with kids."" This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his comments.

I rely a lot on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes create issues. For instance, people often ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents financially; I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong individuals, and I think they would be offended if they felt they should rely on me completely. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to make life a bit easier for those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, and it doesn’t solve all my problems.

After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do for years. I want to go skiing the day after I retire. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg while skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."
24,"It was Sam Carter who helped us move to Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. My father struggled to write while we lived there, and Sam, worried about losing clients and money, offered to find us a cheap place to stay. During the summer, the beach was mostly empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point didn’t attract many visitors; the road was not inviting, and the nearby resort of La Carmella was more appealing. Only those who were broke or really into surfing would come to Reef Point. 

However, with the hot weather, the beach became crowded. After months of solitude, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to finish a script, and he was stressed. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first arrived at Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to join us. I tried to send him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but it was just a weak attempt to scare him off. Rusty understood this and got closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to?” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.”

Rusty loved the beach and often dug up things to bring to me. Sometimes he found items that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim much faster. Surprisingly, he never got discouraged. 

That day, after swimming, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script, leaving Rusty and me to enjoy the beach. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed tireless. One surfer stood out; she had a graceful style that made the others look clumsy. Eventually, she decided to end her session and rode in on a final wave. 

“Hi,” she said, “why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No, he came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, *Tall as the Morning*?” I nodded. 
“I read that book cover to cover.” 

She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that mentioning *Tall as the Morning* always made people more friendly and curious."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long line at the Southampton docks, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line extended out of the building marked ‘Departures’, and no one was moving. Her friend Annie, who was experienced in travel, had told her it was better to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. However, this time, Annie's advice was wrong. 

After some time, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. This news made the atmosphere among the passengers tense. Some tried to stay patient, while others attempted to lighten the mood, but most people felt frustrated. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and it was supposed to be a special experience. The delays did not give them confidence in the cruise.

Violet felt uneasy and wanted to leave. She reached into her bag for her phone but realized it was missing. This was more frustrating than the long wait. It made her question whether going on a cruise was a mistake. Without her phone, she couldn’t call the taxi company to check if she had left it in the cab, as all her important numbers were stored in it. Her son Harry often warned her to avoid such mistakes.

In the queue behind her, a friendly couple stood. Violet asked if she could borrow their phone to make a call. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn’t share this with Harry. He often thought he was more experienced than his mother, while her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes, as he often made them too.

Eventually, the line moved, and Violet reached the window to hand over her travel documents. However, her spirits dropped further when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a cheap imitation of a fancy hotel. It had shiny fake wood panels, extravagant chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets that reminded her of airports. 

She followed the signs to the elevators, which were crowded with tired passengers. As the lift moved up, it stopped at each floor, letting out relieved travelers. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out and felt a sense of freedom. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to spend as much as she could to ensure she had a good view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he discovered 30,000 photographs taken by Maier, a talented street photographer known for her striking images. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, 100,000 negatives, and many 8mm films and audiotapes. 

One morning, Maloof looked around at his collection, realizing he was on the brink of something significant, all thanks to luck. “When I bought this, I had no idea what it was,” he said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together details of Maier’s life. They reached out to families who had employed her as a nanny and spoke with staff from the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be a private person, often seen wearing oversized coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and wouldn’t be seen again until late at night,” recalled Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.”

Maier was knowledgeable about theater and film. Although she was not very social, she would walk the streets with her camera and sometimes interview people on audiotape. She seemed to be dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “Nothing stopped her.”

Maier’s work is pure art; she did not create it for commercial purposes. Her photographs often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. “What is fascinating about Vivian is the number of interesting pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style or borrowed ideas from others.

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever sort through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof began taking his own pictures. “As I grew as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It was the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to her work than I initially thought, and I realized I was holding something more important than I ever imagined. Now, our goal is to make her name known and ensure Vivian Maier is recognized in history.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often suggests that it has not fully succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK during a time when her book was very successful, and she was at the center of a lot of attention. Despite being in her twenties, she appeared calm. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. 

She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass, and the official asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have occurred, leading a council of 12 men to come together to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters.

At over 800 pages, the book is “big by necessity” because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair chance to shine. When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded by saying that coming from a small country makes everyone feel a part of her success. She received a lot of support from people back home, including “back pats from other people’s grandmas.” However, she expressed frustration when people assume her book is not a serious philosophical work.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in a spiral shape, where each part is half the length of the previous one, making the story speed up as it progresses. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she aimed to create a book with structural patterns that might not be important, but if readers cared, they could find them.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Interestingly, Catton did not plan the story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then see how creatively she could resolve them. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers. 

We also discussed her love for television dramas, noting how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would be interested in screenwriting, and she replied, “That could be pretty cool.” Her enthusiasm was clear, and she laughed softly as she spoke about her writing and New Zealand. 

She mentioned that being in Britain changes her perspective and helps her understand why writers often leave New Zealand for more populated areas. However, for now, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."
28,"As a child, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either building things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has made a living by handcrafting steel-string acoustic guitars. He expresses his fascination with the guitar, wondering how two pieces of wood can create such beautiful sounds and how different types of wood can change the sound. Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven and wanted to learn the bass guitar at sixteen. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to build it himself. He studied how different shapes and woods affect sound and learned how to put them together.

Before making the bass guitar, Jonny and his brothers had already built model boats and planes, so he was familiar with the process. His father taught them how to use tools like saws and chisels. Jonny had also customized and repaired instruments for his friends. Although his bass guitar turned out well, he hadn’t thought about a career in guitar-making at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture, so after finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university, believing it combined design and a promising career.

However, halfway through the architecture course, he dropped out, feeling it didn’t suit his individualistic nature. He realized that guitar-making was a form of sculpture that involved creating sound, and he thought it might be a more practical career than pure art since it involved making useful items. Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he worked part-time cleaning windows to support himself. Initially, he sold his guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he gained a reputation as a skilled guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, nearly forty years later, he describes his work as “still scratching a living,” as he can only make about ten guitars a year, limiting his income.

In the early years, Jonny focused on getting known. He attended music festivals on weekends, encouraging musicians to try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, as he wasn’t naturally inclined to think about such matters. Jonny believes that it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were valuable, even though the UK has always had good instrument-making courses and skilled craftsmen. Now, however, UK-made guitars have gained the recognition they deserve.

Jonny thinks that valuable skills can be learned in classrooms, and he encourages new instrument-makers to take available courses. However, he also believes that there is no substitute for learning through experience. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and what doesn’t. For example, if the back of a guitar is too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. He feels that being self-taught allows for a broader understanding, while learning from someone else may limit you to just one method."
29,"Any discussion about English conversation usually starts with the weather. Following this tradition, I will mention the well-known remark by the 18th-century writer Dr. Johnson, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This statement is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many commentators stop here or struggle to explain why the English seem so focused on the weather. They often make a mistake by thinking that when we talk about the weather, we are genuinely interested in it. 

For instance, the American writer Bill Bryson points out that English weather is not particularly interesting. He notes that in England, we don’t experience extreme weather events like tornadoes or monsoons, which are common in other places. Therefore, he finds it hard to understand why the English are so preoccupied with it. In response, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that Bryson misses the point. He believes that the English interest in the weather is not about strong feelings; rather, it is about its unpredictability. Living on the edge of an ocean means that the weather is always changing, and you can never be completely sure what to expect.

From my research, I believe both Bryson and Paxman overlook the real reason for our weather conversations. These discussions are not truly about the weather; they serve as a social tool for English people to connect with one another. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not genuine inquiries about the weather. Instead, they are standard greetings or conversation starters that help break the ice. 

In a way, English weather talk is similar to ""social grooming"" seen in monkeys and apes, who spend time grooming each other to bond socially. There are specific situations where weather talk is appropriate. Some writers claim that the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is not accurate. In reality, there are three main contexts for weather talk: as a simple greeting, as a way to start a conversation about other topics, or as a fallback topic when conversations stall and there is an awkward silence. 

This frequent use of weather talk can give outsiders the impression that English people discuss nothing else. An English conversation might begin with a weather-related greeting, move to more weather talk to ease into other subjects, and then return to weather talk when the conversation slows down. This pattern explains why many people, including some English commentators, believe that the English are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build a structure that is 120 km long and 5 meters high around 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip, choosing it over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not enough. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to provide context about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself.

After retiring from teaching for 31 years, Alice began her new career as an author in 2001. Although she had a successful teaching career, she felt she was stepping into the unknown. She compared teaching to acting, saying it was physically demanding, while writing was exciting but less exhausting. Her former colleagues envied her because she still connected with children through her stories.

Alice aims to fill a gap in children's fiction. She noted that much of today’s adolescent fiction focuses on negative experiences, which, while well-written, often presents dark realities or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are different. She always tried to teach English and History together, using lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel ""Tale of Troy."" She is motivated by her love for children and enjoys the moment when a child goes from boredom to interest and understanding. She sees her writing as an extension of her teaching.

Alice was inspired to write her first novel partly because she noticed a gap in the market, but also because her two sons were leaving home, creating an ""empty nest."" Additionally, her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course. Initially, Alice was hesitant, not wanting to spend her summer on a course she thought unnecessary. However, she had to submit her best piece of fiction to be accepted, which she only learned a few days before the course started. She quickly created a story about a Roman couple and their unborn child. After three hours and 30 pages, she submitted it and was accepted.

During the course, her classmates reviewed her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice's husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was crucial in editing her novel. Alice believes they complement each other; he improves her writing by changing sentence structures and suggesting word changes, while her instinct is to add more scenes. This difference highlights the roles of a fiction writer and an editor."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to participate in a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and rugged Yorkshire Dales in northern England, starting at Semerwater lake and ending at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high.

As they prepared to start, Jonny expressed his excitement, saying he had never done anything like this before and was looking forward to the beautiful views from the car, especially since it was very cold outside. Alistair, dressed in full winter cycling gear, was also eager but joked that he might stop for tea because he was unsure if Jonny could drive well enough to win.

The race began, and Alistair quickly took off on his bike, heading straight up the hill. Jonny got into his car and started driving. However, just 15 seconds into his drive, he encountered a large tractor blocking the road. He complained to the cameraman about the delay, saying if Alistair won, it would be because of the farmer.

Once past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair faced challenges on the steep slope. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, which was a strange sight for the sheep watching him. After a tough climb, Alistair finally reached the top and began to pick up speed as he rode down the other side.

Meanwhile, Jonny was dealing with narrow roads and obstacles in the villages, which made it hard for him to drive quickly. He carefully navigated through a narrow corner and a stream on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he sped towards the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close they were to each other. As Jonny accelerated down the final stretch, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. Just as he reached the finish line, he asked the crowd if Jonny had arrived yet. When they said no, he celebrated, thinking he had won.

A few moments later, Jonny's car pulled up, and he stepped out, looking disappointed. He congratulated Alistair, saying, ""Well done,"" but admitted he was upset about losing."
32,"The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing only the echo of your own shots. The well-kept grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a peaceful atmosphere that separates you from the outside world. This quiet is beneficial for my game. The biggest challenge during a match is to focus only on the game and the current point. When a point ends, the silence is broken by applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t realize there are fifteen thousand people watching closely, or that millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the most important match of my life.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach since I was young, taught me that this is the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. However, before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice in the finals, once in 2006 and again in 2007. The loss in 2006 was not too hard; I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer won easily, but the defeat in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have performed better; it was not my skills that let me down, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing is always painful, but it hurts more when you have a chance and fail to take it.

Toni, who is usually very tough and critical, surprised me by saying there was no reason to cry and that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand; I felt this might be my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career can be, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment is important, but some moments are more significant than others, and I had let a big opportunity slip away in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to comfort me, but he turned out to be right. Another chance came just a year later in 2008. I felt confident I had learned from my previous defeat; this time, my mindset would be strong. 

The night before the final, at dinner with family, friends, and team members, we avoided talking about the match. I didn’t explicitly tell them not to mention it, but they understood that I was already mentally preparing for the game. From that moment until the match started, that mental space was mine alone."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood.” This woman was Jane Goodall, and she would spend most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Jane Goodall gained fame when Britain’s National Geographical Society published articles and made documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her popularity grew with her own writings, including award-winning children’s books and the 1971 bestseller *In the Shadow of Man*, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real accomplishments. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on sentimental aspects and do not fully capture her work. 

People have portrayed her in various ways: as an adventurous girl, a privileged woman who wanted to live with wild animals, and a determined feminist in a male-dominated field. These portrayals can diminish her true contributions. Based on academic references to her research, the success of her students in biology, and the extensive data she collected over forty years, Jane Goodall should be recognized as a pioneering zoologist. More simply, she opened our eyes to the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.

Before Goodall's work, wild chimpanzees were seen as dangerous, and many misconceptions existed about them. For example, no one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools, and we did not understand that they share emotions similar to humans or have complex social structures. Goodall discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have unique cultural traditions. Her book, *The Chimpanzees of Gombe* (1986), is the most authoritative work on this subject and serves as the first encyclopedia for chimpanzee research. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world.

Jane Goodall changed how we study animals, and since chimpanzees are our closest relatives, she also changed how we view ourselves. Even as a child, there were signs of her future as a biologist. One clear example occurred in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, she disappeared, prompting a search by the police, neighbors, and family. After a frantic search, she reappeared alone, with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had hidden in a henhouse and stayed still for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the beginning of her journey as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of a playful 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to fans of children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she explains, “so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.” 

Shirley shares what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even well-known ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there’s more to it. You need to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get the roles because they are too used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a traditional acting career. During the course, she occasionally sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she recalls, “the studio manager suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and surprisingly got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just fell into place for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors often provide the voices for young boys and girls because their voices are lighter than those of male actors. Hiring child performers involves complicated procedures and lots of paperwork, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds and to vary her voices by watching children’s TV. 

Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days of animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for voiceover work is intense, and having a good showreel – a recording that showcases what an artist can do – is very important. “It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley advises. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes her success – being near the top of her field – comes from determination as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and sharing it with film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also thinks a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and often becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over, and I’ll speak like that for hours or even days afterwards,” she explains. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in completely different voices.”"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many dream about as children, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and choose more practical careers, such as tax lawyer or auto parts manufacturer. The idea of making a living by drawing simple doodles, like those in high school notebooks, seems unrealistic. Yet, some people do manage to do this. 

Becoming a cartoonist is not the same for everyone, but most who succeed have wanted to be one for a long time. I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist, with a strong love for comic strips, contributing to school publications, and being known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to various companies. I was fortunate to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, and they bought them. Within a few months, I was earning enough to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even advanced drawing skills. You just need your mind, your hand, and something to make marks with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. While the technical requirements are low, the job is still challenging. You should only pursue this career if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to find a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living from your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I accept various jobs because you can learn a lot, even from work you may not enjoy. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

Now, let’s talk about the business side of being a cartoonist. In the past, many cartoonists could find steady jobs with different newspapers and magazines. However, those days are fading. Today, cartooning is often an entrepreneurial activity, meaning you not only have to create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with this process, the more successful you will be. I have seen many cartoonists with average creativity but strong business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ circle it, and write your name and the date next to it. However, the reality is that it is more likely no one will be interested in your work. If, by chance, someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster—it could actually be a lucky opportunity!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of the items I chose to throw away was an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a beautiful, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate throwing things away, so I was surprised by my decision. I took it to the dump and was about to leave it there when a young man approached me, looking confused. He asked, “You’re not really going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could take it, and I agreed. After that day, I felt sad about my choice.

A few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened the email from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had changed hands many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name and address on a label on the guitar and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was overwhelmed with emotion and would have paid anything for it, but his price was very reasonable. I had forgotten that my dad always put name labels on my things, including the guitar. I could imagine my dad laughing at this strange situation.

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar when I was young, as it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the soothing sound of the classical guitar, which was easy for beginners to play. However, I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar and played simpler music. This was also the time of punk music, where anyone could become a rock star, even if they weren’t great musicians.

When I opened the box that Keith sent me and took out my old guitar, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt amazing; it was smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play but quickly stood up and put the strap over my shoulder, as electric guitars are meant to be played standing. My fingers instinctively knew where to go. I couldn’t explain the chords I wanted to play, but my hands remembered. My fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to form a chord. 

The electric guitar is not usually played alone, so now that I’m learning it again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or perhaps I can find others my age who have had similar experiences. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote my book, Insomniac, which focuses on people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was one of the few warning others about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and emotions. Many insomniacs I interviewed emphasized how essential sleep is for our overall well-being. Interestingly, those who have the most trouble sleeping often understand its importance the best. It’s encouraging to see sleep finally receiving the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. There hasn’t been much conversation about them. We often lose our dreams, especially when we wake up early and miss the last hour or two of sleep, which is primarily REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep—the stage where most dreams occur. Our most vivid and emotionally impactful dreams happen during REM sleep just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, meaning that someone who lives to be 90 years old will spend around six or seven years dreaming in this state. When researchers prevent people from experiencing REM sleep, they find that the next night, the amount and intensity of REM sleep increases to make up for it. This suggests that dreams serve a purpose.

When REM sleep was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the focus shifted to the physical causes of dreams rather than the psychological ones. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are significant. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams much better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as film is one of the most dream-like forms of art. However, I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively?

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and often surprising ways, using knowledge from our past and present to create new associations. They may assist us in discovering patterns and combinations that challenge our usual ways of thinking. For instance, Stickgold found that when people are awakened from REM sleep and asked to respond to a specific word, their answers are more original compared to when they are woken from other sleep stages. They tend to think outside the box and combine ideas in unexpected ways, which is a key aspect of creativity. Personally, I find that I write better after experiencing intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one that I can barely recall, seems to spark my creativity and provide inspiration. On those days, words and images flow so quickly that I can hardly keep up with my typing. I’m not sure how it works, but it does seem effective.

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and everyone needs their brains to function at their best. We all need to think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, which has a stunning view of the sea, you see several empty frames on the walls, along with cheerful photos of her two daughters. As a leading artist in the copyist art movement, Susie can recreate the beauty of early 20th-century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. It seems unusual that she doesn’t keep any of her own work. “I don’t have any around,” Susie says casually. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” 

The reason is that Susie is highly sought after. Over her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by many famous artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts often mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions at auctions, her copies range from a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. While many collectors genuinely love art, some are more interested in status. One celebrity enjoys showing off his “Van Gogh” painting, which is actually a “Susie Ray Van Gogh.” “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors even save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank and displaying Susie’s copy instead.

Susie is transparent about her work. When she copies a masterpiece, she aims to make it look as authentic as possible because she believes that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. However, she always signs her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and although she knows people who have profited from fakes, she has never been tempted. Those who create fakes often face serious consequences. Susie admits she isn’t wealthy and has faced challenges, but her situation is more stable now, and it wouldn’t be wise to risk her reputation with collectors and artists.

Susie didn’t start as a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. Looking back, she appreciates that experience because it helped her develop a passion for plants and taught her the importance of accuracy. She has no regrets about that time, but she is glad to have found a more financially rewarding career.

When younger artists seek her advice, Susie emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to master her craft. Her training allows her to create everything from detailed plant drawings to perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces and 20th-century abstract art, although she now focuses on French impressionists, particularly Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 

Susie notes that many people think modern art is simple, almost like child’s play. However, she explains that while impressionists painted quickly and freely, they were also very precise, making their style challenging to replicate. Given her skills, it seems strange that Susie doesn’t create her own original art. Isn’t art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than her copies? She believes her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own pieces, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—acceptable, but not impressive. It’s as if she has spent a lifetime enjoying gourmet meals and now finds it hard to settle for plain bread and water. Ultimately, Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest on it. This obsession began in her childhood. She felt a unique connection with the boats that took her around the world; they worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life felt unimportant. People were too curious about her races, and she quickly longed to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had almost defeated her.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she invited me to see the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher. This cabin had been her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She explained how carefully she planned her supplies, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial for her. She proudly showed me her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her attention to detail in keeping the boat was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her entire world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen views the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, and fragile thing with limited resources. A significant moment for her was a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she participated in a bird survey for albatrosses. This experience made her reflect and see things in a new light. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. She felt that humanity often takes what it wants and moves on without considering the consequences.

When I arrived at Ellen’s office, she was finishing a heated conference call. She explained why we need to act now to protect the planet. “Coal, oil, and gas are no longer being made. They are valuable resources we have only once. We need to find ways to avoid wasting them.” Initially, her message was negative—encouraging people to use less—but she later realized there was a more positive approach. Now, she focuses on reusing materials, passionately discussing things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, speaking with government and business leaders about our dependence on non-renewable resources. “I will never be an expert,” she admits, “but I am like a sponge, absorbing information. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Compared to this, sailing felt selfish. This is about discovering how my voice can be most effective. It truly matters.”

Ellen also founded the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that collaborates with businesses and educational institutions to inspire young people to rethink and design a sustainable future. “I do miss the adventure of being at sea,” she says. “It defines who I am. You feel connected to everything around you, and there’s no time to feel lonely. You focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message is more complex than just saying, ‘I want to be the fastest around the world.’ While I may have been the fastest, this work is more important than anything I’ve ever done.”"
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his time. He hopes to encourage other young people to explore the outdoors instead of just spending time on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero,"" and climbing Everest is just part of their plan. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to complete the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before turning thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish the challenge before he turns 14.

I spoke with several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They agreed that while a young climber might be physically strong, they doubted whether a teenager could handle the emotional challenges. They also questioned how a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing.

The Romeros are aware of these concerns. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can't focus on it – we have a lot to do. We think about potential problems, of course. Karen and I constantly assess the risks, but we believe our experience as climbers will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming very strong and mature.""

I also wonder about Jordan's reasons for wanting to climb. Is this just an ambitious father pushing his son too far? Paul insists, ""This project isn’t about me seeking fame through my son’s achievements. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him regularly to ensure he still wants to do it.""

When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ""I just focus on achieving my goal."" In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting event. The more daring the record, the more attention it gets. This creates a challenge for Jordan. While we might think that focusing on achievements takes away from enjoyment, if he wants to inspire others, he must engage with the media. This means blogging, posing for photos, and giving interviews. He needs to offer something impressive, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop mountain climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I recently started a music degree, but my classmates know just as little about classical music as others our age. If someone doesn’t know who composed a piece, they probably don’t own any recordings of it. This situation must be disappointing for classical music lovers. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and the average classical album sells only about 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. 

So, why is interest in classical music declining, even though it has existed for centuries? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games for this decline, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are in the minority. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, can be challenging for us. We prefer fast conversations, quick actions, and rapid thoughts. Experts say we struggle to pay attention for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Additionally, pop music often addresses topics that interest teenagers, while classical music usually does not have lyrics or relatable themes.

The way we listen to music has also changed. In the past, families would gather to play music together, and playing an instrument was highly valued. Now, we can find any music we want online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music playing in a store? One of my teachers says that audiences at classical concerts have increased recently. Maybe that’s true, but I doubt many of those new attendees are teenagers. In my orchestra, we perform classical music in various places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I’m not sure why middle-aged people are more drawn to classical concerts, but I do know that if teenagers’ parents love something, they often try to avoid it.

Some people blame schools for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many students are eager to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it’s not their preferred music outside of that. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you regret I came here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother understood how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings scattered among the trees on a hillside; it looked confusing at first. Then she noticed signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved through the trees. “I wish you’d walk next to me instead of trailing behind like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, she stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll probably be kicked out soon anyway, so I might as well leave now.” She walked out of the building and headed towards the riding centre, following the sign. 

There was a charming old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around but saw no one. She approached the horses with a sense of respect. They were well cared for, and she noticed that almost every stall was occupied. She walked along, carefully observing each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. Then she stopped in front of the next horse. “But aren’t you the best one here!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” She read his name above the stall: Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. They can’t be far.” 

To her delight, the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. As she focused on putting the saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she climbed onto the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in control of everything around her. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I’m serious; I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could become great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling exhilarated as a gentle breeze brushed against her cheek. She sensed that Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"I have met Cody Simpson before and have always admired his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So, how did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody explains, “I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven.” He remembers that swimming and surfing were his main interests back then. “I was 13 and in high school when I posted a few videos online.” 

These videos changed everything. He started by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans began to comment online, asking for more videos. Cody, who had recorded more songs at home, was happy to share them. The response was incredible. 

Cody was also a talented swimmer, training hard with top coaches to improve his skills. However, record labels began to show interest, and he faced a difficult decision: stay in Australia and continue swimming or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the leap. “It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” 

He had to tell his swimming coach and friends about his move to the States. “It surprised most people. I’m the quiet kid,” he recalls, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy industry.” So, Cody packed his bags and traveled halfway around the world, giving up one dream to pursue another. 

Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from behind the scenes. Cody believes it’s important to have a close circle of good people around you to stay grounded. Everyone has moments of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight and travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how this affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.” 

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big opportunity, even when it feels scary. “Everything happened so quickly and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m visiting countries I never thought I would see and performing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. It’s something many people dream of achieving, but I know it won’t last forever.”"
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I squinted and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags into place. Last week, I had worked long hours with most of the adults in town, showing that I could handle the job. My grandfather, however, didn’t seem to notice. 

With one hand still on the curtain, I scanned the half-mile stretch of dark water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. On either side of the dark water were fragile ice shelves, and solid ice continued downstream. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I noticed a boy on the far side of the river. I didn’t recognize him. I frowned as I saw him trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from an expedition in South America. This chain is more special to me than having a famous grandfather, as only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that journey, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen.

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his bedroom. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you off to?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious from my wetsuit, and he had seen me in my kayak every morning. I tried to ignore his temper, but it was getting harder. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His harsh words hit me hard, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came over with a sympathetic smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself at the moment,” I finished for her. I held back from saying he had always been like this. But like my mom, I tried to be understanding. When I was younger, he was my hero, especially when he showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang framed on his wall, along with his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. 

My mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and headed downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I quickly walked towards the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her into the study, where she saw an unframed painting on the table, leaning against the wall. It was clearly one of Grandpa's works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" 

Jess looked closely at the painting. It showed a river that took up most of the scene; it wasn't a river she recognized, and it might not even be real, just a fantasy. The painting was strange and beautiful in a haunting way. The riverbank was barely visible, with just a hint of green that was easy to overlook, drawing the eye into the pale waters and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she found it captivating, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that seemed too casual, revealing her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings; he just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt strangely significant to her, but she couldn't explain why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""But there is no boy."" 

""Exactly. It's strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. But since he hasn't finished it yet, maybe he plans to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" 

""Mum! You should have known better."" 

""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can probably guess his response."" 

Jess didn't need to guess; she knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not the artist's job to explain a painting because each one has its own life and language, just like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to every fool..."" 

""Ignoramus, he said."" 

""...every ignoramus what it means. If artists had to explain their work to everyone who asked, they would never get anything done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" 

""Inspire?"" 

""Yes, someone who motivates an artist."" Jess understood the term. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse wasn't helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a tough part to work on. He never suggested that the muse was her. In fact, she always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally gone into the carpet and made a big cut. I’m not claiming that this actually happened, just that it could have. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the moment, as often happens. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This kind of thing happens to me quite often. I feel unlucky in that way.

What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved from her house to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and it has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. Now, I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, so I was excited when she gave it to me!

The problem is, it’s a corner cabinet, which means it has to fit in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom belongs to Mum and Dad, the back one is my sister Angela’s, the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s, and my room is the size of a broom cupboard. Mum says that when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. Then, when Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I’ll be stuck in my broom cupboard for a long time. I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only issue is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. 

I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. I thought, if I can’t cut anything off the cabinet, why not cut a hole in the carpet? It seemed like a simple solution. Dad calls this kind of thinking “lateral thinking.” I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that’s exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" tells the story of a tiny family living secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They survive by ""borrowing"" items from the larger humans around them. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of this novel, I knew it would be challenging to meet the expectations of fans. People who love the book have strong opinions about how it should be portrayed. To avoid criticism, I relied on the original illustrations from the book. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, which made filming more complicated.

A key aspect was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on their borrowing adventures, we had to position the camera ten times further away than usual. To capture their perspective, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from a height of no more than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans doing this! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots.

One major challenge was creating realistic shadows when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized surroundings. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we achieved it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with oversized objects to make the actors appear small. It was wonderfully surreal. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really embraced the idea. The coins we used were larger than dinner plates and hard to lift, often making the crew laugh, which sometimes interrupted filming.

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to be pushed down a tunnel with hoses, and they found it so scary that they didn’t need to act. Getting the costumes right was also important to me, as other directors had struggled with this in previous adaptations. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas to give them a doll-like appearance, which made it difficult for the lead actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug to avoid a smooth look. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail with the costumes!

Most of the action outside the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. This made it hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of each scene to show the team how they should look, and by the end, I had created 2,000 sketches. They weren’t perfect, but they were helpful. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly; I once filmed an entire scene only to realize there was no film in the camera. In the end, everything came together, and I believe the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there are none. I know that soon the chaos will start. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who will ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life of touring and tutors. While the rest of the band is renting here for recording, we are staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet regular kids. I want to meet someone whose mom works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so cool and normal.

I walk into the school’s main office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary seems confused. “Oh,” she says, typing my last name on her keyboard. That’s one good thing; few people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she replies. Then she tears the sheet and hands it to me. English Literature, first period. Great, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. But I’ll be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map the night before so I wouldn’t look foolish searching for my classes.

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and take a seat in the last desk of the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my very normal outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. No one will suspect me now! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I glance down at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I reply. The teacher pauses. “Desert... McGraw?” she says carefully. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually gives us our course outlines. After discussing the books we need to read this year, she actually lets us socialize! All teachers should understand how important this is.

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few options. Should I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or should I share what my dad says? “We need a change, Desert,” he told me, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Essence? I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a studio right by the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, lies are easier. “What does he do?” she asks. Whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, fiddling with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care. Perfect."
49,"Not only is the average American teenage girl expected to be the president of the Student Council, but she also needs to have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America today. Both boys and girls cannot just go to school and blend in; being average is no longer enough. Mediocrity is not acceptable, and lacking ambition is seen as laziness. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, points out that many adults forget how much pressure teenagers face today. They have a lot of homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to maintain a social life. Despite these stresses being common, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, many believe it is unfair to label an entire generation this way.

Kristen Loose argues that many people assume teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She acknowledges that she often has her phone nearby, but not for trivial reasons. For her, it is a tool that helps make life easier, not just a way to text friends. Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and to be reachable at all times, which can create the impression of a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere, and schoolwork now requires attention around the clock.

Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish their activities after midnight. Their schedules are packed with school, extracurricular activities, family responsibilities, and homework. They then have to wake up and do it all over again the next day, often getting less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of American teenagers get the recommended amount of sleep, and 28 percent admitted to falling asleep in school at least once a week due to lack of sleep.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen believes that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen rarely spends her free time on social media or watching TV; instead, she dedicates her energy to volunteer work. She feels that the stereotype of teenagers is that they are self-centered and only care about their own interests. However, she enjoys volunteering and looks forward to making a positive impact in her school and community.

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these views and contribute positively to the world. There will always be a new generation of students making a difference before they even finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This ongoing science project combines astronomy with adventure, which is likely why teenagers are drawn to it. I joined them one weekend in late spring as they prepared to release a high-altitude balloon to capture images of shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a bright trail.

As night falls, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside, there is a camera, an altitude measuring device, and a thermometer to track temperature changes during the ascent. Two GPS trackers are placed on the outside of the lunch box to help them find it later. They use a gas tank, donated by a supporter from a nearby state, to inflate the balloon, which gradually expands to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour round trip to get the tank, but he didn’t mind. For these kids, such efforts are normal.

Finally, it’s time for lift-off. They count down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon starts to rise. Some of the teenagers run after it, using powerful flashlights to track its path in the dark sky. There is a moment of silence and a shared sense of wonder as the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside, looking at a sky so clear that it’s hard to believe they are only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with around 4 million people. I see a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” one girl whispers. “I know,” replies another. Suddenly, a meteor streaks across the sky.

As the balloon rises, the air pressure decreases, causing it to expand until it is almost the size of a house. Then it pops with a loud bang. A parachute ensures that the equipment inside the lunch box lands safely back on Earth. The students will retrieve it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recoveries are a big part of the program,” says the group’s leader, noting they have only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “This journey helps us get to know the landscape in a way we normally wouldn’t.”

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or stuck in a tall tree. “These students are familiar with the Eastern Sierra,” their leader explains. “What seems wild to some is just a normal part of life for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box, which was in a canyon on a flat rock near a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera did not capture any shooting stars. While this was disappointing, it provided a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and their effects above mountain ridges. It also became another exciting story to share with anyone who asks."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she turned fifteen. Her interest began by chance when her younger brother became fascinated with dinosaurs, a phase many children go through. Although she initially dismissed his interest, she helped him with a science project and discovered an article about recent findings in Palaeontology that amazed her. From that moment, she knew she wanted to pursue this field.

I asked Chloe about the support she received, as Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people at that time. She recalled meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite his young age. Chloe felt nervous at first, worried that he might see her as just an annoying kid. However, she felt more comfortable when he showed patience and listened to her questions.

I also asked her about how palaeontologists are portrayed in movies and TV shows. Chloe expressed her frustration, noting that films like Jurassic Park, which feature dinosaurs created with special effects, have increased public interest in dinosaurs but not necessarily in Palaeontology itself. She feels that palaeontologists are often shown as either eccentric geniuses or socially awkward individuals, which does not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explained that her job is very diverse. She spends a lot of time digging for dinosaur bones, but she also works long hours in laboratories analyzing fossils and writing scientific papers. Although it is not always part of her job, she believes it is important to communicate scientific findings to the public, especially to young people. She wants to help them understand science better and inspire their interest in the natural world, starting with dinosaurs.

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She mentioned that the producers were knowledgeable, and her role was mainly to ensure that the dinosaurs were accurately represented in terms of size and shape, and that they lived during the same time period. The documentary attracted viewers of all ages because it presented dinosaurs in a way that was much more realistic than in movies like Jurassic Park.

When I asked Chloe why dinosaurs continue to captivate us and remain a focus of research, she suggested that they appeal to our natural curiosity and desire for exploration. Dinosaurs remind us that there is still much to discover in our world, and Palaeontology offers a unique way to explore the past."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are just six years old, you probably know that you are not “there yet,” even if you keep asking, “Are we there yet?” The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not “there” anymore; it’s “here.” So if you think you might be “there,” you should really be asking, “Are we here yet?” 

Parents often wish they were “there” more than anyone else, especially when they hear that question repeatedly during long trips. Think about it: wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You could watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the beautiful views outside. Meanwhile, one of your parents is in the front seat, managing snacks and the radio, making sure everything runs smoothly.

But then, something unexpected happens—usually caused by my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat, which is not okay! I respond by putting my foot on his side, and soon we’re both fighting for space. Our parents have to intervene, telling Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a bit, and we can enjoy the scenery again.

Later, while I’m trying to read, I suddenly feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing air in my direction. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. This makes me angry, and soon he gets yelled at again, causing more chaos in the car. 

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle our questions. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he often replies, “Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.” When we point out that we are still driving, he says, “Oh, then maybe we’re not there yet.” This usually keeps us quiet for a while. 

You can tell you’ve finally arrived when the adults quickly exit the car to get away from the kids after a long journey. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is no, you’re not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where customers can enjoy coffee and cake while playing board games. They hope that people will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: “There’s so much technology today. Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve staring at screens. It’s natural for people to connect and communicate with each other.”

The café features games called ‘Eurogames,’ which have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged until the end, so no one feels left out. This idea was further developed in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players either win or lose together, encouraging more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, designed by North American Matt Leacock, who was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. Leacock recalls, “When I played that with friends, we felt scared and excited. In the end, everyone felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to create something similar.”

Leacock’s love for board games started when he was a child. He enjoyed receiving games as gifts but often felt disappointed when they didn’t meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he began redesigning games to make them better. Pandemic became a huge success, and its follow-up introduced even more storytelling elements. Leacock explains, “It’s like an electronic game where you develop characters, learn new rules, and the world changes. It tells a story.”

Interestingly, the rise of video games has helped modern board games become popular. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to trying board games. Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company, says, “Everyone plays mobile games now. Most people with smartphones have at least one game they enjoy.” 

For a while, video games allowed for social interaction in places like arcades or through multiplayer games at home. However, as multiplayer games moved online, players became more isolated. This led some people to seek out board games to play with others in person. As seen in John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our increasingly online world, games are now a way to connect and share experiences in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are crucial in the music industry, even if your career starts with many setbacks. He describes his mother as ‘an amazing singer’ who encouraged him to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was a local one aimed at middle-aged listeners, which influenced his musical taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a contemporary song. Around the same time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room learning songs on the piano. He recalls, “I was doing well in tennis, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do for my life. It was just too much hard work.” At 17, he left school to pursue a career as a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but didn’t share his passion for performing. Jamie remembers breaking down in front of his parents, telling them he wanted to pursue music, explaining that he had been writing lyrics during economics lessons and practicing the piano every day while others played outside. His father gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After several close calls with record labels, he was signed by a music publisher at 19 based on one song. However, record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend. Ultimately, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album, but fame did not come immediately. He reflects, “I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for much of my artist career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he truly found his success. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists, helping them launch their careers. Sometimes, he has to reassure the artists he works with that aiming for chart success is not something to be ashamed of. He asks them, “Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?” He emphasizes that they should aim to create something amazing that will also sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write hit songs. Jamie is not arrogant; he simply understands that he wants to write number-one hits and has the talent to do so. Instead of worrying about how others perceive him, he focuses on his goals. He states, “When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for global success and write the best music of the next year. It’s not just about what’s trendy; we want to create classic modern pop songs.”"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing bike stunts. He is known as a ‘street trials cyclist.’ This means he jumps from difficult places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other challenging spots. These stunts are recorded and shared online.

When I interview him, we meet at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids recognize him, and even some older people come to greet him, calling him ‘an absolute legend.’ After watching him perform, I agree with them. I came with some doubts, but I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and I often find it hard to believe he can succeed. However, when I compliment him afterward, he seems uninterested and a bit down.

Despite his online fame, Tony says he is not comfortable with being a celebrity. He finds the social aspect challenging. He understands the importance of connecting with fans, but he prefers to focus on doing stunts rather than talking about them. This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that capture his stunts. He reflects, “This technology allows people like me to earn a living.” He feels that many people are always recording themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t fully agree with that.

Tony is not complaining, though. He makes a good income from his videos, which would have just been a hobby for someone in the past. After years of interviewing top athletes, I’ve learned that two key factors turn a passionate child into a top competitor: energy and the ability to handle emotional disappointment. These traits can be more important than talent and help someone keep going despite failures. In risky sports, it’s even more important to have mental strength.

Even at the park, Tony fell a few times on what he considered easy but new challenges. He simply got back up and kept trying until he succeeded. Not everyone sees him as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, “Those who criticize me may care, but they don’t understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and don’t know the sport. They don’t realize I get advice from experts to reduce risks.”

In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some never feel scared, and they shouldn’t be doing these sports. It’s important to recognize the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those who can overcome fear and those who can’t. I belong to the group that feels fear but finds a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes, I ride around for a while to get in the right mindset before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm just before I jump. If I fully commit, I’ll be fine.”"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen focused on taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took her 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterward. “I’m glad it’s over!” Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. He had previously written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, ""That trip opened my eyes,"" and decided he wanted to explore the world by bike. Instead of a regular touring bike, he wanted to create one himself. He thought the most unique bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made.

After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, which ended because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. Although he met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which he couldn’t do, he never regretted choosing the penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more people were amazed by his bike.

His toughest experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to return home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, ""If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing."""
58,"I work at a university in the US with my team, and we are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have recently started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’ that helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about the black duck population because their numbers have decreased significantly, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. 

We have a lot of information about their activities during the day, but we know very little about what they do at night because we did not have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, allowing us to learn more and make better decisions about how to protect their habitat.

Our work is challenging. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in various locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites to record every duck I see. The weather has been difficult; some nights are mild, but many are rainy. It is so quiet that I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. 

Despite the challenges, I enjoy this work, especially when I think about the summer ahead, which will involve long hours in a laboratory analyzing our findings. Being indoors will be tough, but it is necessary. I wouldn’t change this experience for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people about my job, they often find it hard to believe that it exists. But I’m serious! I spend my workdays tasting chocolate! This is a crucial part of ensuring that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate from my company. Each week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate from our factory, and I need to evaluate them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw ingredients we typically use, like nuts and fruit, to select the best ones for our chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I create, and I enjoy sharing samples with my colleagues! My kitchen is equipped with machines and ingredients, making it a fun place to work. It’s great to have a private area to escape to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel abroad to buy raw materials, which can be challenging since I have a young family. However, I love the variety and lack of routine in my job, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part!

People often ask me if I ever get bored of chocolate. I’ve been working with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and enjoy more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a center that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it offers many different skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching objects like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can attend some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing repeatedly – it’s essential to keep performances exciting and dynamic. If you want to succeed in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great aspect is the friendships formed with other performers and the opportunity to learn from them. Staying fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. While training is crucial, the best performers are those who are determined to succeed, have creativity, and continuously work on improving their skills. 

People often think that injuries are common or that you only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other career options.” The course also includes lessons on business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia cautions that it’s not a profession for making a lot of money! “The work usually doesn’t provide a regular salary. It’s also very competitive – but it’s a lot of fun!”"
61,"You may not know her name or face, but you have likely heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer, which means she sings in the background to support the lead singer. Some people think backing singers are not as talented as lead singers, but that is not true; they often have to be even more skilled. People like Mariam are the true stars of the music industry!

“What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she explains. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a silly tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just do my job!”

“Excellent musical skills are crucial for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. Often, there is no sheet music to follow. I will never forget my first experience recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was really nervous; I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough!”

“One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range works best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.”"
62,"Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge of fashion but built a successful business selling ‘satchels,’ which are traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous stores and are popular among many celebrities. Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, such as cake decorating and party planning, instead of just going with her first thought. When she chose to focus on satchels, not everyone supported her idea. Julie recalls, “Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks.

Although Julie was not familiar with fashion blogs, they played a key role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her products grew, along with the speed at which her company produced the satchels. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is photographed with a satchel!

While other companies spend money on online ads, Julie uses the internet community to gather ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now ensures she has confidence in her production team, just as she does in her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices, where people enjoy working. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes the workplace special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents allowed her and her brother Jamie to choose how they spent their free time. Vicky enjoyed participating in various sports. She was a talented swimmer, and her coach believed she had the potential to become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard for her to balance training with her schoolwork.

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and began competing. Vicky found this exciting and decided to try cycling too. She later said it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and performing well. The cycling track was close to her school, so attending training sessions after school was easy for her. Vicky eventually had a successful career in track cycling, winning several competitions. However, when she turned 28, she decided to retire from competitive cycling. She explained, “For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement fades, it loses its meaning. Fortunately, I found a new career.”

Vicky began working for a charity called CycleZone. She explained, “We help young people who have never enjoyed sports. Our first step is to teach them how to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does important work and brings young people together, creating a sense of community.” The charity uses celebrities to promote its activities. Vicky mentioned, “Some people doubt that celebrity support is always beneficial for a charity. They argue that celebrities may be more interested in their own image, which can overshadow the charity's real work. However, if famous singers and actors can help, I believe they should.”"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, music was always present in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to take her off the stage. This teacher suggested that she join the school theatre club to build her confidence. After participating in the club for some time, she happily sang with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course led by a professional. Although she was the youngest student, she already knew more about music than many of her classmates. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her ideas, which inspired her to write the song ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled to receive comments from people who loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened.

Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join the company. At first, Ana was uncertain because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss assured her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope, and all the tickets sold out quickly, making it a wonderful evening.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments, as she feels there is more to express during tough times. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which reflects on why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her music, her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an incredible trip – a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist like me and wanted to write articles about the journey. He loves boats, which is not something I share with him. However, I had always dreamed of visiting this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before our departure, there were storms in the area we were visiting. Fortunately, the weather forecast for our trip was good, predicting calm seas. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry assured me he would handle everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we met the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast, and indeed, the only other creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat created in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were filled with colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was wonderful to forget about how fast or slow the day was going. We always remembered to prepare lunch and dinner together over campfires. Each evening, when we fell asleep on the boats, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to share our adventures with everyone back home!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a child, I watched many of his games. You might think that this would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how great my dad was, especially when he won, but I often brought a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training sessions, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I found myself in a game against another school. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to learn from him. However, I didn’t enjoy being away from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t too different for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted that decision."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was quite expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from a tourist's perspective, and it felt like a new experience each time!

After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I realized I needed to learn a lot more to get a license. All tour guides in Chicago must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. You also need other important skills. You should be entertaining and able to tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you must adapt to unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems or what they are missing.

I need to ensure that visitors are happy with my tours, as negative reviews online can harm my business. Like most tour guides, I understand that good reviews attract more customers. That’s why it’s essential to make tours enjoyable and stress-free. I believe that my enthusiasm and energy in my job lead to very positive reviews, and many visitors recommend my tours to others coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I traveled to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first experience doing something like this. However, we ended up having a great time.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. They eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of our day. Josie found it quite challenging, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meals made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using large brushes and soap. I found this very enjoyable, even though I ended up getting wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they would spend the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, which was a bit cramped, but we chose to do this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we were prepared for that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both don’t like.

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff would spend the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often mention Thailand. However, if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I’m not sure she is being completely honest, though. I think she might feel a bit frustrated with herself for not fully enjoying her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she reflects on the experience, she realizes how fortunate she was to go. Maybe she will return one day – I definitely will!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to individuals for gifts or home decoration, but also to various businesses. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and we sometimes provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle for a wedding, which was a lot of work, but I felt very proud of the result.

My day begins at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be quite cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, filled with flowers from around the world. The beautiful sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were picking flowers for myself, I would choose only pink ones, as that is my favorite color. However, I have to remember that my preferences may not match what my customers want. 

Sometimes, it’s difficult to find the flowers that customers request because not all flowers are available year-round. I don’t enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I always try to get the best price I can. 

When I return to the shop, we review customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought into vases. Then, we create flower bouquets and calculate the costs of the orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes need to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some might think this is too much effort, but I enjoy figuring out how to create the best flower arrangements within a customer’s budget. That’s what selling is all about, and I wouldn’t want to do anything else!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many children's movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized I wanted something more – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For instance, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which created a great atmosphere for the movie, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are even free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs without aiming for profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can track ticket sales online, so we no longer worry about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but it feels wonderful when people of all ages tell us how much they enjoyed the experience. Our website has been very helpful, and we are now connected with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to learn how they operate, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local reviews. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as word of mouth – when people recommend us to their friends. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film; last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I started a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began.

After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my perspective and the way I captured images. I enjoyed photographing many different subjects. Then, someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and decided to focus on nature, especially birds and the sky.

Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they preferred color. This made me doubt my project at times, and I almost gave up. However, I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for my age group, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges announced that I had won first prize. I was incredibly happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good enough for a professional career. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice of career."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities that challenge you, and you are always learning. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you receive a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be to help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was quite shy, and the other children already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to accept the challenge because I wanted to earn my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I found myself wanting to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I completed the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had formed great relationships with the children. Now, I spend about four hours a week there, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I have decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about this career before starting at the club. In fact, I had never considered my future job, and the idea of youth work had never crossed my mind. This experience has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The slope looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try it. At that age, I hadn’t thought about asking him to start snowboarding, but he loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it seem easy, and eventually, I did well. After that first experience, I quickly grew to love the sport and improved my skills. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and lose interest in snowboarding, but my passion for participating and winning has only grown stronger over the years, which motivates me to work harder.

I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well. For example, I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I didn’t think I would attempt the jumps that earned me that score until I actually started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. In the summer, I focus on training and my studies since there’s no snow. Even though I train every day, it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also get to spend a lot of time with my friends, which helps me cope with not being able to do what I love most.

I need to think about my future carefully. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I believe it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is a possibility, depending on whether my active lifestyle allows me to pursue a college degree. I can’t imagine ever getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only get it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am very grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I never thought it would be so easy, as it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something beautiful at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I appreciated their support, I needed to be sure that my jewellery would be popular with others. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home. Soon, we started receiving calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but in reality, it was just my mum and me at the market! That’s when I realized my business could succeed, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I have made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our market stall. It has been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly inspired by Janine’s own life. In an interview, she explained, “Because my father’s job made us move around a lot, I learned how to make new friends easily. I know what it feels like to be the new student in a class, which helped me write about Amelia’s experiences in a new school. Some of the funniest moments in the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination to create that.” 

Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to spend her time this way. The year before, she had won a short story competition on a young writers’ website. This success made the publishing company eager to read her finished novel. They loved it, and a year later, Being Amelia was available in bookstores.

One review of the book notes that, despite the cheerful images of teenagers on the cover, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer also mentions that even though Janine is young and her novel is not very long, she has shown that she is a better writer than many bestselling authors. 

Janine is still adjusting to her fame: “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now I’m fine with it. I want to help other young writers, but they need to discover their own style. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I’ll find something interesting to write about!”"
76,"My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was excited about this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should accept the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home across the water, and there was no school nearby.

However, once we moved, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle itself isn’t particularly beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. In the summer, the island feels very lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live here, but there aren’t as many teenagers as I had hoped. The adults support each other and help with repairs on the island, which can be hard work.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to the stormy days with big waves, but the ferries don’t operate then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! But we often enjoy amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it’s so foggy that you can’t see anything, but then it can suddenly turn into bright sunshine, which still surprises me even after living here for a while.

Of course, we do experience terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to withstand them. But then I remind myself that it has been here for centuries and is still standing strong!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours observing them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best spots to see them. It was incredible, and when we returned home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am close to achieving it. During family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries as well. We always look for places that offer group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! 

I have been to Egypt, and last summer we traveled to South America, where I thought I might see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I have learned that patience is important in this hobby. I shared a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it interesting and commented positively. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I went on stage, knowing that the whole school and my friends were watching me. I had notes to help me, and I remembered what to say. I only relaxed after it was over when the teachers told me I had prepared well and that they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year!

I feel fortunate to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not consider birdwatching, but there are actually many birds to see, especially in areas with lots of greenery. I believe birdwatching clubs should work to attract more young people to this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to be expensive."
78,"I began playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved the game, and soon I became a decent player. My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought I would do the same with football. But that never happened. I even started dreaming of becoming a professional football player as I grew older. 

The chance to pursue this dream came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees saw my potential and asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her team. At first, I couldn’t believe it—I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and at just 13 years old, I began regular training with a big club. I improved a lot during this time.

Despite my progress, some people doubted I would ever become a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. However, my coach encouraged me to be myself and to believe in my abilities. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. By chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with a large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my teammates carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals.

Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to meet other players from my club. This will help them see what a professional environment is like and inspire them to believe they could play for a top team if they are willing to work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me: there will be good times, but also some challenges. Fortunately, I have faced very few challenges, so I consider myself lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in education in the UK and around the world in recent years is the push for new students to get involved in research as soon as they start their studies. This change acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries. Instead, research is a natural and essential way to build knowledge and skills. The skills you learn from research will be valuable not only in your studies but also in your future jobs, as they help you think critically about the world and approach your work effectively.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just memorize and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions rather than accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we encounter? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes and new knowledge. However, research can also start from simple inquiries that involve careful work, thoughtful questions about various issues, following leads, and making practical suggestions.

Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done some research for school projects or answered questions at work since you began your education. You have asked questions that required investigation, whether you were curious about studying or figuring out how to do everyday tasks, like planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training a pet, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, you are expected to have an inquisitive mind, identify problems and questions, critically evaluate information and ideas, and create your own responses and knowledge to contribute to discussions. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning often involves listening to teachers and texts without questioning them. It may feel disrespectful to challenge established knowledge or authority, and you might think you should be told what is important to learn.

However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. Engaging with and constructing knowledge can seem intimidating, but critical thinking is crucial in research. The research done by others is valuable for students, academics, and professionals, but we must not simply repeat what we read or accept everything as fact. Instead, we should think critically about it, test it, and determine whether the information is logical, well-reasoned, and supported by evidence. We should avoid relying blindly on the facts and information provided by others."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were places where people discussed science and politics. Similarly, in modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were popular among artists like Pablo Picasso, who talked about modern art. However, living in a city can be challenging. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also contributed to the spread of diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 

Today, cities are known for their creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming and unnatural. Recent scientific studies have started to explore how city life impacts our brains, and the findings are concerning. While it has long been understood that city living can be tiring, new research indicates that it can actually impair our thinking, sometimes significantly. One major factor is the lack of nature in urban environments. Research shows that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can enhance brain function by providing a mental break from the stress of city life.

This research comes at a significant time: for the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of enjoying open spaces, we find ourselves in crowded concrete environments, surrounded by many strangers. It has become clear that these unnatural settings can greatly affect our mental and physical health and change the way we think. 

Consider what your brain has to manage while walking down a busy street: distracted people, dangerous road crossings, and the complex layout of the city. These everyday tasks can drain our mental energy because they require us to constantly shift our focus. The brain is like a powerful computer, but paying attention uses a lot of its energy. In contrast, natural environments do not demand as much mental effort. This concept is known as attention restoration theory, introduced by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our attention. Natural settings have elements that naturally attract our focus without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. This allows our mental resources to recover.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to incorporate nature into urban areas. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a much-needed escape from city life. A well-designed park can enhance brain function in just a few minutes. While many have looked for ways to boost mental performance, such as energy drinks or office redesigns, nothing seems to be as effective as simply walking in nature.

Given the many mental challenges caused by city living, one might wonder why cities keep growing. Even in our digital age, cities remain vibrant centers of intellectual activity. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that can lead to attention and memory problems—like crowded streets—are also linked to innovation. Scientists believe that the “concentration of social interactions” is key to urban creativity. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, fosters creativity in technology. Conversely, less crowded areas may produce less innovation over time.

The challenge, then, is to find ways to reduce the negative psychological effects of city life while preserving its unique advantages. After all, there will always be moments when someone might say, “I’m tired of nature; take me to the city!”"
81,"Where should we search for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe there is no strong reason to limit the study of the mind to just the brain or the body. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as brain cells, play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that items like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have significantly influenced human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, I propose that what exists outside our heads may also be part of our minds. 

It is understandable why we often connect the mind with the brain. Most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their surroundings. This approach is practical for neuroscientists, especially when using brain scanners. However, it often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking occurs outside our heads. I do not intend to deny the importance of the brain in thinking, but I want to emphasize that the mind is more than just the brain. 

Instead, we should consider the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes into play. MET explores how objects can become extensions of our thinking or be integrated into our bodies. For example, when we create numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool, we are engaging with materials in a cognitive way. 

MET also looks at how these interactions have changed since ancient times and what these changes mean for our thinking. This perspective provides new insights into what minds are and how they function by examining the role of objects in our thinking. 

Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person's self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick illustrates how minds and objects can be seen as interconnected. It also highlights the flexibility of the human mind: by using the stick, the blind person transforms touch into a form of sight, and the stick itself plays an active role. The brain perceives the stick as part of the body. 

The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can adapt and change significantly by incorporating new technologies. I view the human mind as an ongoing project, constantly evolving. It is essential to remember that, regardless of the form that tools have taken throughout our history—from ancient stone tools to modern technology—their main purpose has been to connect us with our environment rather than to limit us. 

For humans, tools are used to satisfy our curiosity and desire for knowledge. This unique ability to engage with material culture explains why humans create more than any other species, and how these creations shape our minds. I refer to this concept as metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and develop as we interact with the material world. 

I aim to reintroduce the importance of materiality in understanding cognition. MET provides a new perspective on how various forms of material culture, from ancient tools to smartphones, have played a crucial role in defining and transforming who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, it is important to recognize that humans have been using such technology since our earliest days."
82,"Few inventions have changed civilization as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of culture at all levels—practical, scientific, industrial, and artistic. It also opened up new forms of entertainment. Historians argue that photography is the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts, as it has become central to American intellectual and artistic discussions. To fully appreciate its impact, we need to look at its origins in the mid-19th century.

Photography was appealing for several reasons. First, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing interest in technology, reflecting a national attitude that embraced change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into homes in an immediate way. 

Second, the camera became the preferred tool for expressing identity, allowing people to create images for public viewing in a society that constantly reinvented individual and national identities. Third, the camera played a significant role in preserving family memories, even if those memories were somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs aligned with a broader artistic trend towards depicting everyday life in US art.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are created by machines, they are records of events, people, and objects, which gives them a sense of objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by a person, it also carries a subjective viewpoint. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize its subject, leading to the idea that photography is a ""universal language."" Yet, the meaning of a photograph is more complex. 

No subject inherently conveys its own meaning, and every image is presented with some context that shapes our understanding—like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and context: Why did the photographer take it? How was it first seen? Additionally, the same image can have different meanings depending on where and when it is viewed.

While the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized for a long time, it is now clear. In recent decades, starting with artist Andy Warhol's use of photographs in his work, many artists have incorporated photography in various ways. In summary, photography has become an essential part of art, complementing painting and shaping our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician known as one of the founders of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, which gives us some understanding of the concept, but it can be difficult to study, not just in humans but also in animals like rats and monkeys. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, a physical world that exists in time and space, and a way of knowing about these elements. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, which may or may not align with scientific facts. 

This personal understanding can lead us to make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We often act as amateur psychologists when we share opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing is effective or why people behave in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems can arise when two people interpret situations differently. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in specific situations. Psychologists help us differentiate between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

While psychology studies the mind and brain, psychologists do not yet fully understand how the brain works in relation to our emotions and behaviors, such as during childbirth or watching a football game. It is often not possible to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not directly observable like a machine's. Instead, we can only infer them from behavior.

Studying psychology is similar to solving a crossword puzzle; it requires evaluating and interpreting clues. These clues must come from careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical analysis that can be publicly examined. Psychology often involves complex interactions, and understanding these requires advanced techniques and theories. Like any other science, psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to influence the processes it studies. Achieving these goals can help us understand our experiences and apply findings to improve people's lives.

Psychological research has been beneficial in various areas, such as creating better methods for teaching children to read, designing safer machine control panels, and helping emotionally distressed individuals communicate their feelings. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation has only occurred in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to answer psychological questions, focusing on identifying mental structures. While this remains an interest today, introspection has clear limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only allows us to see a small part of the brain's automatic functions. William James compared introspection to trying to see how darkness looks by turning up the gas quickly. Therefore, modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than solely on their own experiences."
84,"In a simple building in a regular business park in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays items that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product tells a story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. 

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a successful business. You might think that any serious manufacturer would keep a collection of their failed products, but many executives who visit the museum show that this is not common. They often avoid thinking about their failures and do not keep samples of their unsuccessful products. 

The museum was started by Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, who originally wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. Beginning in the 1960s, he collected samples of every new product he could find. He did not realize that most products fail, which led to his collection being mostly made up of unsuccessful items. 

Today’s optimistic culture likely contributes to the products in the museum. Each product probably went through many meetings where people did not see the problems. Even if they did, marketers might have felt pressured to invest more money in a failing product to save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and people often avoid discussing it.

This focus on positivity is especially strong in the self-help industry, where a common idea is ""positive visualization."" This means that if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to happen. Some researchers, like neuroscientist Tali Sharot, suggest that our brains may be wired to see the chances of success as higher than they really are. Her research indicates that well-adjusted people often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence outcomes, unlike those who are depressed.

However, how effective are these positive thoughts about the future? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied this question. Their findings show that spending time imagining success can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For instance, people who were encouraged to think about having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our experiences with failure depend on our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think it can develop through effort and challenges. Those with a fixed mindset find failure very upsetting because it suggests they did not meet expectations. For example, a talented athlete who believes they are naturally gifted may not practice enough to reach their potential. In contrast, people with a growth mindset see failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being challenged. Overall, having a growth mindset is a more positive way to approach life, regardless of whether it leads to success."
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But do we really understand why? It seems obvious, but professional sports are changing quickly, and many things we thought were true are now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to discover what helps players perform their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

This raises questions for fans. For example, would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. This belief may lead them to confuse cause and effect. When a team plays well, the home crowd cheers loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans often remember the cheering and the goal, but they forget the many times the cheering didn’t lead to success.

However, there is one common belief among fans that scientific evidence supports. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a well-known study, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another version without sound. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team compared to those who watched in silence. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers concluded that referees try to avoid the stress of making calls that would upset the home crowd.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change could be travel. In the past, travel was difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and if their hotel isn’t good enough, the club will find them a better one. Local conditions used to vary greatly, but now top stadiums are becoming more similar in their efficiency.

Despite these explanations, none fully explains the data. These changes, like pampered players and similar stadiums, have happened recently. The mystery remains why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the highest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual matchups between the batter and pitcher. Team sports require coordination among teammates. In basketball, success depends on teamwork, which builds confidence when playing at home, regardless of the playing conditions.

Another possibility relates to a more primal aspect of sports. Research shows that players’ testosterone levels are normal before training and away games, but can be 67% higher before home games. This increase may be linked to a natural instinct to protect their home ground. For example, during the Rugby World Cup, underdog teams playing at home won against stronger opponents, showing determination and aggression—characteristics of home advantage. As one referee put it, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’'"
86,"""The more I practice, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying has become famous among dedicated athletes and their coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with many claiming it was said by other golfers of that time. Its meaning is also unclear. Player was not talking about luck in a literal sense; he was being ironic. His real message was that more practice leads to better performance, but only up to a certain point. 

This idea connects to the nature-nurture debate, which questions whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop. However, this discussion is not balanced; it often favors the idea that practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for the theory that becoming an expert in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice. This idea has been popularized in books like Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers,"" as well as ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor in achieving expertise.

However, in his engaging book, Epstein challenges this view. He points out a flaw in much of the research on excellence: it often focuses only on successful individuals. He asks if there are better ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate innate talent from factors like environment, support, and determination. 

Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden and the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the drive and desire of sled dogs in a tough race may be influenced by their genetics, suggesting a link between nature and traits we think are voluntary. This raises the question: can determination be a choice, or is it partly genetic?

Epstein emphasizes the complexity of this topic. He distinguishes between ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture), agreeing that both are essential for elite athletes. He does not deny the importance of training and environment, suggesting that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. 

Epstein also explores the roles of race and gender in sports. He questions why we separate men and women in competitions if only practice matters. Sometimes, the best questions are the most straightforward."
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so dissatisfied? In her new book, Kith, she explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main issue. 

A follow-up study interviewed children to understand their feelings better. It found that many of them do not wish for the latest technology; instead, they would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults over 40 often reminisce about their own childhoods, recalling how they enjoyed long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They argue that this was healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they are the ones who created this protective environment for their kids, avoiding risks like building forts in old sheds.

Griffiths’ book contains strong arguments. She discusses how the fear of dangers in the outside world leads parents to keep their children at home, which benefits the toy and gadget industry that sells entertainment for indoor kids. She also criticizes trends like prescribing medication for restless children or requiring safety goggles for playground games. While I am unsure how common these strict rules are, Griffiths expresses her frustration with passion, discussing various aspects of childhood freedoms and limitations, from fairy tales to school rules.

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas and ignores important counterarguments. At one point, she even compares the modern treatment of children to a subtle form of racism, which seems extreme. She tends to have a romantic view of children, often overlooking their more challenging behaviors. For example, she claims that “children are the musicians of thought,” suggesting they could be creative if given the chance, but I doubt this is always true.

One of the main themes of the book is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need to experience some danger to learn how to manage risks. She writes, “Children need accidents,” meaning small accidents that help them avoid bigger ones later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Additionally, not all children may want the adventurous lifestyle Griffiths admires. What about those who are naturally shy or prefer staying at home? Perhaps the real issue is that we try to fit all children into the same mold, whether by keeping them indoors or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and personal life, but this skill is not just about what I learned in school. Many life problems cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. Instead, they need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from real-life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those who have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores, like lions, play more than herbivores, like cows, because hunting is more complex than grazing. Primates, including humans, play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instinct. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are given the chance. 

Play is a natural way for both adults and young mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and managing their own feelings. Creativity is essential for success in today’s economy. We no longer need people who simply follow instructions or perform routine tasks. Instead, we need individuals who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce. 

However, creativity cannot be directly taught; it can be stifled by a school system that focuses on fixed questions and answers. More importantly, children need to learn how to interact with others, care for them, and work together. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they develop social skills and learn about fairness and morality, which are crucial for their future. 

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop at any time. If they cannot quit, it is not truly play. Players understand that to keep the game enjoyable, they must consider the happiness of others. This freedom makes play a very democratic activity. 

Unfortunately, school has become more demanding, with fewer breaks, more homework, and greater pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games, and adult-supervised playdates have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play. Adults often feel they need to step in rather than allowing children to resolve their own conflicts. 

These changes have happened slowly but have had a significant impact over time. They are influenced by various social factors, such as parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We need to give childhood back to children, allowing them to play and explore so they can grow into strong, well-rounded adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is much easier than the old method of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher risk of making mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many influential contacts, and the job seeker thought she might help him. However, the executive was offended by the idea of sharing her contacts with a stranger who hadn’t earned that privilege. She not only rejected his request but also sent a sarcastic message that quickly spread online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she likely regrets her tone, if not her message. 

This incident highlights an important point: social media can be a risky tool for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Unfortunately, many young people are making mistakes. There is an irony here because social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of young people for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers, a place to impress others and create a different identity. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different, and some young people do not see this difference. They may still act boldly and confidently, thinking this is appropriate. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you are a good candidate. It is important to understand that the social networking skills learned as teenagers do not apply in the professional world. 

Employers often complain that young job seekers are too casual in their communication and come across as arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of young people as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly introduce yourself and explain what you can offer them, such as doing research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of receiving a positive response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to leave a good impression. Remember, social media can be a powerful tool for making connections, but it requires careful use to avoid closing doors."
90,"Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show a troubling trend: since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by 30 to 50 percent. According to the Pew Research Centre in the USA, only 26 percent of Americans now rely on newspapers for news, down from 45 percent in 2001. Many people confidently predict that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that traditional media often survive longer than expected. 

For example, in 1835, a journalist in New York claimed that books and theatre were finished, and that newspapers would become the main source of social life. Yet theatre has survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived even in the age of TV, and cinema has continued to do well despite the rise of videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745 percent since 2008. 

Interestingly, newspapers were once considered a new form of media. It took centuries for them to become the primary source of news, which was made possible by advancements like the steam press, railways, and the telegraph in the mid-19th century. This shift also involved a new understanding that the world is constantly changing, and we need regular updates—an idea that was foreign in medieval times. Back then, people mainly recognized the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life was seen as cyclical, with recurring truths.

Before the 19th century, journalism as a profession was not well established, and there was little reason for most people to seek news regularly. The fixed schedule and format of newspapers can be limiting. In contrast, online news allows readers to access information based on their own interests and the urgency of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms help personalize news, and updates can be made almost instantly when important stories break. There are no space limits, allowing for more detailed narratives and analyses.

However, many news providers seem focused on being the first to report rather than on spreading understanding. This creates confusion, similar to the medieval marketplace where news was mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. Newspapers have often struggled to explain how the world works. They may be facing extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our sense of living in a chaotic universe, newspapers might find a way to guide us toward greater wisdom and understanding."
91,"If humans truly felt comfortable under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, just like many nocturnal animals that thrive in it. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes designed for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genetics, even if we don’t often think of ourselves as daytime beings, just as we don’t think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This understanding helps explain our impact on the night. We have changed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While it has benefits, it also leads to light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 

Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design that allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it downward where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and rhythms that many life forms, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects various life activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would have been meaningless. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and there were no public gaslights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. We have illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. There are many nocturnal species among mammals. Light is a strong biological force that attracts many species. Scientists have noted that songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by searchlights or gas flares, circling endlessly until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journeys are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours due to artificial light.

Initially, it was believed that light pollution only impacted astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. While most of us may not require a perfect view of the night sky for our work, we, like many other creatures, need darkness. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is crucial for our biological well-being, just like light. Disrupting our internal clock can lead to various health issues. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping reflects the natural light changes on Earth. These rhythms are so essential to our existence that disturbing them is like changing our center of gravity. 

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a brightly lit highway. By living in our own artificial light, we have disconnected ourselves from our evolutionary and cultural roots—the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the vastness of our existence, which is best understood against the backdrop of a dark night filled with the Milky Way overhead."
92,"The founder of a large multinational company recently announced that his business will stop tracking employees' paid holiday time. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change feels like a superficial attempt to make a potentially unkind policy seem more friendly. 

We should consider whether this idea is practical. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services, including finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn't hurt the business"" seems more suitable for a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads better. In a larger company, it is harder to judge whether taking time off will negatively impact the business or their careers.

The founder has said that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel completely sure that their team is up to date on all projects and that their absence won't harm the business. But is it really possible to be that certain? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more waiting for you when you return. This means that employees might feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress. If workers feel pressured not to take leave, it could actually reduce productivity over time.

Additionally, there may be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. In many corporate environments, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a situation where employees feel they cannot take holidays, especially if they are competing for promotions. Without the security of guaranteed leave, employees might hesitate to take the time they need, fearing they will seem lazy. 

This policy could create a situation where workers feel stuck and unable to take their entitled leave, or they might continue to rely on their legal rights as a guideline, making the new policy ineffective. Modern technology has also blurred the lines between work and personal time, as employees can receive work messages anytime and anywhere. 

The internet company started its unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how it fit with the old system of tracking time off. If the company can’t keep track of how much time employees work, why should it apply a different standard for time off? However, a downside of having no set working hours is that employees may feel they are always being watched, which can lead to unhealthy self-discipline.

Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is essential for their mental and physical health. The benefits of increased morale, creativity, and productivity can happen without compromising worker well-being. Therefore, I am skeptical that allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is truly the goal or will be the result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is often seen as a way to ensure the quality of research, as it aims to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year, raising the question of whether this delay is worth it for the reliability of published research. The answer is both yes and no, and exploring this issue reveals much about the current state of scientific publishing, which is changing.

I still believe in the importance of journal-based peer review and think that all papers should go through some form of checking before they are published. However, I notice a shift happening. The increasing use of preprints—drafts of papers shared online without peer review—plays a significant role in this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new findings so that others can read, critique, and build upon them. The focus of journal publication has shifted more towards reputation and career advancement, which has affected both authors' motivations and reviewers' roles.

The competition for publication in prestigious journals encourages scientists to produce high-quality work, and these journals do publish excellent research. However, the strong rewards for publishing in top journals can lead to shortcuts, as researchers may omit inconvenient data to make their work more appealing. Reviewers are often tasked with deciding if a paper is good enough for a journal rather than assessing its overall quality. For leading journals, this decision can depend more on the paper's relevance or newsworthiness than on its scientific merit.

These issues are well recognized, but many are reluctant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently suggested in a preprint, preprints could offer a solution without drastically changing the existing norms. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they have not been widely adopted. This slow acceptance reflects scientists' conservative nature and the common belief that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to the spread of poor-quality research, although this has not yet happened.

While preprints are not peer-reviewed, authors understand that they are open to critique and discussion from a global community of reviewers. For example, psychology professor Tanya Elks shared her experience of critiquing a published paper. In the traditional peer review system, the original authors might block critical feedback, or if they are not chosen as reviewers, they could complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, both sides could engage in open discussion, allowing readers to assess the quality of the arguments. The risk of rejection by journals is less concerning since the preprint and its comments remain publicly available, ensuring that the work is not wasted.

Preprint archives facilitate informal scientific discussions that were once limited to private correspondence. They can also serve as a platform for sharing negative results, which are often overlooked by journals focused on new discoveries. Additionally, being on preprint archives significantly increases the visibility and citation of papers, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method of sharing research. By embracing the internet's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the research itself, rather than the prestige of the publication."
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" However, these answers usually do not satisfy either me or them. One day, I asked a group of students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it: one as a scientist would, describing it objectively, and another from the object's perspective, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote about an oxygen mask, saying, ""I may look weird or terrifying, but I’m a device that helps people breathe."" This unusual choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to laughter and meaningful discussions.

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I viewed each poem as a puzzling challenge that hindered true understanding and emotion. After school, many people become less interested in poetry. Occasionally, a poem catches your attention because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel proud for trying.

What do we seek in poems? We might expect them to express deep emotions, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp humor. While this seems true, we often turn to films for tears, online articles for information, novels for escape, and music for a perfect blend of lyrics and melody. However, one unique aspect of poetry is its ambiguity, which reflects the complexities of everyday life.

Searching online for ""poem"" leads to ""poetry,"" defined as a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This definition sounds impressive, but it overlooks the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is a ""maker of things."" So, if a poem is a created thing, what kind of thing is it? Some poets compare poems to wild animals—uncontrollable and unpredictable—or to machines—carefully designed and precise. However, these comparisons often break down upon closer examination.

The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it generates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this debate can change how you think about both. It encourages us to rethink our usual patterns of thought and see ordinary things in a new way. Poems can be mental objects, especially since song lyrics often stick in our minds. The combination of words and melody has a strong impact, similar to schoolyard rhymes like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" Yet, words can sometimes hurt, just like sticks and stones.

Consider a poem printed in a newspaper or magazine. It can resonate deeply, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose surrounding it. The white space around the poem could have been used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is crafted through writing and rewriting, just like any article or story, but it does not aim to be a product for sale. Publishers promote poetry collections, but few expect them to be profitable. A poem exists for its own sake, and because of its unique position in a magazine or book, it can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector shortly after getting married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and I could have used it for something practical for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered brought me joy because it made me feel connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a nearby spot known for old farming equipment. When my detector first beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t walk away without checking. I dug down about half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. Having found brass curtain rails before, I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before—the Great Torc, which is displayed in the British Museum. It’s a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a twisted necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I had found.

I took it to my car and couldn’t stop looking at it on the passenger seat during the drive home. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in centuries. “Marion!” I called out, “I have something for you.” As I admired my find, I heard my wife enter the room and pause. “What is it?” she asked after a moment. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were worried about damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. Although we had never been robbed, I felt anxious and restless. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath.

The law requires that such discoveries be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before handing it over. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I brought it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone with his back to me. When I placed the torc on his desk, he turned around, stopped mid-sentence, and authenticated it. Eventually, it was sold to my local council and is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the landowner and me. 

However, the torc means more to me than just a lucky find. I feel like I have preserved a piece of history for the nation. People often say to me, “Now that you’ve made such a great discovery, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins just as interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing—there’s always the chance of catching an even bigger one tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my greatest joys when I travel, but I rarely mention it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends talk about their carefully planned trips filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and stay quiet. What would they think if they knew my travel plans often include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in comfortable beds in Italy? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. 

When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—over 12 hours most days. Even with noisy birds nearby, it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could enjoy a deeper, more dream-filled sleep than I ever expected. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. 

However, I believe that the quality of sleep while traveling is different for a reason. I think sleep is actually part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we expose ourselves to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. This flood of new experiences continues even while we sleep. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are away from home.

Sleep also changes in rhythm depending on where we are. People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For instance, in Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to adjust to their different sleep patterns. When I finally adapt, I feel like I have truly arrived.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a large lunch with new friends in an apartment overlooking the Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and one by one, my friends left the table to relax on hammocks and sofas. I realized why they had so many pillows around. I took a few for myself and joined them. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day, I truly experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life.

Travel sleep has another wonderful quality: I remember it. Being away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new scents, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If the idea of ‘slow travel’—taking the time to enjoy each experience instead of rushing—is what defines the modern traveler, then what could be slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is, in fact, an important part of the journey."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror and asked, “What do you think? Be honest.” Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said diplomatically. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that resembled a bulldog. “But it’s so boring,” she replied. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will help me stand out.” She patted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. “Yes, this is the one I want,” she decided. 

Mia knew she couldn’t change the woman’s mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. As she thought about her own daughter, Jen, who was turning thirty today, she felt excited about their family gathering. It had been a while since everyone had been together, and she looked forward to seeing Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing, someone they didn’t know much about. When Jen had called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, her husband Jeff had quickly reacted. “Tattie? What kind of name is that?” he had asked. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia explained. “I think it’s nice.” “More like something pretentious,” Jeff replied. He didn’t like anything showy and often criticized Mia for being too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and might have even said a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The problem with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite for your own good.”

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. Her commute from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff had been doubtful. “Do you really think there’s a demand for hats?” he asked. Mia had listened to friends complain about finding the perfect hat for special occasions and knew there was definitely a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became successful. Women traveled from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where she provided a relaxed environment for them to try on as many hats as they needed. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she had expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry as well."
98,"It’s a long journey from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident but seems surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly starting a new career. Although he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still figuring out what his new position involves.

The idea that a 21-year-old newcomer from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports is surprising. However, Lawrence is known for proving doubters wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on training for the discus instead, having previously played rugby. Within 20 months of starting, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower.

Lawrence initially came to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in a potential NFL contract, he confirms, “American football was in the back of my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school in London, but it seemed unrealistic then. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had no experience, he felt confident enough to apply. 

When asked if he was nervous about competing against experienced players, he replied, “No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.” Although he is not very talkative, he is sure of his abilities. His performance in various tests impressed the coaches, and he was recognized as the standout player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he admitted, showing a rare moment of pride.

However, he remains cautious. With no basic experience, how can he make it onto an NFL team? “Coaches have told me I have the right qualities. It’s all about how hard I work,” he said. Will he be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I’m definitely going to be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness may come from his disappointing experience in the Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that moment and takes pride in having qualified for the final with a strong last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he said. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some speculated that he had let the experience affect him, but Lawrence chooses not to comment. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, making the financial benefits clear. So, Lawrence has shifted from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Given his many talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would think that,” he replied. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can always go back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to find it was already daylight. Looking out the window at the empty landscape below, I saw dark shades of brown and green, which reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, autumn had not yet arrived in Siberia. There were no signs of human life, just a strange mix of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled sleepily at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow, traveling to the remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as limited as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I managed to tell him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. 

“But, Robert,” he argued, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I explained that I believed there was a road, even if not many people used it anymore. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to convince him with hand gestures that I had plenty of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget for my trip. Most of my clothes and gear were bought at discounted prices. In truth, I wasn’t sure if they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers that I had bought for £10.

It all began in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was filled with students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was droning on. I was thinking hard about a dilemma: Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read, “OK.” 

It was six years later that I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and while I still struggled to control my classes fully, the job met many important needs for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and quite fulfilling, plus there were long holidays to pursue adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to visit Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: cycle around the world. Since that first ride together, Al had taken on bigger and bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was certainly his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an incredible adventure, proving he could handle each new challenge, even when it seemed impossible. He was showing the skeptics who said he couldn’t do it that he could. He faced something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots compete by flying through a series of pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate. An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was healthy, and the second stated that I would empty my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay oriented throughout the experience. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I also promised to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was instructed not to touch anything. As we began taxiing down the runway, I was nervous. My legs were up, my feet avoided the important steering pedals, and my hands stayed away from the many switches nearby. Despite the instructions, I found it hard to relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying: to survive without fainting, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right moments. Panicking is not a good idea.

As we accelerated down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and just two seconds later, we made a sharp right turn. It was a sudden and intense movement that took my breath away. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a brief moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out, turned sharply left, and dove down, leaving my stomach behind at 2,000 meters.

Seconds later, we were just 10 meters off the ground, aiming for a narrow space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was interrupted by another sharp turn. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand shook so much that the plane shook too. It was very responsive. When Dario spoke to me, I asked him to repeat himself, but instead, he performed a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. 

I know many people would find this thrilling, like those who enjoy roller coasters. However, I thought it was overwhelming. At the top of the loop, while upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields below. The flight lasted only 10 minutes, but it felt much softer compared to what the pilots experience during races. To show how relaxed he was, Dario pulled out sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about the loop over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan is a filmmaker who captures wild animals in cold environments. If you have seen impressive videos of polar bears in nature documentaries, they were likely filmed by him. He prefers working in temperatures around -18°C. Allan originally trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver, which helped him learn how to survive in cold conditions. His big opportunity came when a TV crew visited Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He ended up guiding the crew to various locations and realized that being a wildlife cameraman combined his interests in travel, adventure, and underwater exploration.

Allan has become a leading cameraman and has contributed to many important wildlife TV series. He started his career at a time when few people had explored Antarctica. While others focused on filming coral reefs, elephants, or chimpanzees, he became known as the ""cold man,"" capturing stunning footage that was waiting to be filmed.

When he began his career 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very basic. He notes that filming is much easier now. In the past, if you recorded something, you had to remember it because film was expensive. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot many scenes and review them immediately, which allows for more flexibility.

Allan believes his experience in cold environments is valuable. He feels comfortable on sea ice, which has become second nature to him. Although he sometimes gets cold toes, he finds the polar regions to be healthy places without leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes.

Wildlife filming has its successes, but also its challenges and awkward moments. For example, while filming kittiwakes in the Orkneys, he struggled to identify the birds. Recently, he received permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, which is known for its polar bears and is difficult to access. In April, temperatures can drop to -32°C, and the strong winds make carrying cameras through deep snow very challenging. After walking for five hours a day and observing polar bear dens for 23 days, he had only seen one mother bear and her cub.

On the 24th day, he felt fully immersed in the polar bear environment. He describes how he and his team would wait patiently, moving around to stay warm. After hours of watching, he finally caught a brief glimpse of a bear. The camera was focused, and he quickly adjusted to capture the moment. He watched as the bear emerged from the den, followed by her two cubs, who were seeing the world for the first time. It was an exciting moment for Allan, who felt like he had front-row seats to a remarkable show.

Now, Allan hopes to create his own documentary about climate change in the Arctic, featuring the stories of the people who live there and witness its effects firsthand. He believes this could lead to an extraordinary film."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk alone to the North Pole without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole as well. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined individuals, and this time, there is a lot at stake. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre trek to the North Pole, where they will measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen understands that the results will be crucial for scientists. This research will provide a clearer understanding of how global warming is affecting the polar ice.

Pen was prepared for this kind of work from a young age. He was raised by his father's old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She toughened him up by sending him out into harsh weather with minimal clothing. His father also inspired his love for adventure in cold places, and Pen developed remarkable physical endurance. He is married to Mary, a horsewoman who shares his passion for the outdoors. Mary helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home than when he is on an expedition. She once raced against him in a mountain event, finishing an hour ahead of him. They live in the countryside with their two children.

Pen admits that it is harder to be away from his family this time. When he last went on an expedition, his children were very young, and he made a mistake in how he said goodbye. He told his son to take care of his mother and sister, which put too much pressure on the boy. This time, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while in the Arctic, as he believes that calling them would remind them of how far away he is. In the days leading up to his departure, he is carefully preparing his equipment. He knows that once he is on the ice, it will be difficult to fix anything or do anything complicated.

Joining him on this expedition will be Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support crew of six people who will fly in supplies. Pen finds being part of a team stressful, and he is also concerned about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained as much as he would like. He often finds that organizational tasks take priority over training, which makes him anxious about the challenges ahead.

Pen believes that this mission connects exploration with the pursuit of knowledge that motivated earlier explorers. He acknowledges that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, the data they collect will benefit scientists and help raise awareness about what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He feels that their unique skills, which may seem unusual in everyday life, are now very important and relevant. ""Suddenly, we’re socially useful again,"" he says."
103,"Text: 'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. While I enjoyed these activities, I felt there was nothing competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to compete for another Olympic spot. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very interested. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? Probably not. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben, who was already planning to enter the race and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat. This made the race feel more real. We discussed the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which was a lot of money. We believed we had a good chance, but it would still require effort to secure funding. Additionally, I had to consider the loss of income from being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It’s nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just be discussing my past; I would be actively doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the simpler life of a full-time athlete. My Olympic training was tough, but it was straightforward. I trained almost every day, but my schedule was set, and I had support from doctors and dieticians. I was initially worried about how people would view me racing with a TV presenter. I feared it would seem like I just wanted to be on TV, rather than choosing a better partner to win. However, my concerns faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also a mental challenge. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. However, he struggled with rowing. I was surprised by how little natural ability he had, and he was shocked by my lack of understanding. I could have been more patient, but I felt it was important to be honest with Ben about the significant improvements he needed to make. I should have realized that this would be his level when I agreed to race with him.'"
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job in London to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, perhaps because I was tired of the noise and crowds of the city. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a position as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow and ice, for trips ranging from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now have over 100. Recently, they acquired a second location called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join their team for three months, but warned me that the hours would be long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical. I began packing right away.

On November 6, while flying to Finland, I found myself staring at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and anxious. Instead, I looked out the window. I remembered that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. However, I felt like I was witnessing winter moving south, as rivers were freezing over.

On November 7, I took a bus north, which was everything I had hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests filled with snow-covered trees, stopping occasionally for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark and was immediately given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. Anna asked if I wanted to be thrown in at the deep end, which was not really a question. I followed the sound of barking and reached the dogsheds, where three people were busy harnessing the excited huskies to sleds. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy to talk. I stood aside and petted one of the calmer dogs. Someone urged me to get in the sled, and I almost fell in. A command was shouted, and we took off into the dark, guided only by a headlamp.

By November 15, I was quickly learning how to be a husky guide, but first, I faced a tough questioning about my skills. Anna asked if I was useful, and I was unsure. Further questions revealed that I had never driven a snowmobile, done woodwork, or used an axe. Finally, someone asked if I had a driving license, and I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. However, many other tasks were complicated. Simple things like feeding and watering the dogs became challenging in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw—in the snow!"""
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was fast enough to qualify for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a natural remedy, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had suggested to help heal Radcliffe's injuries from an accident when she collided with a bike during training. Radcliffe said that the achievement didn’t fully register with her at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a significant moment, but she felt it was just part of her plan for that day, so it didn’t feel overwhelming. She and her team had decided not to set any limits on their performance, following the motto: no limits.

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent expressed concern about her pace, fearing it might cause her to drop out. Hartmann was frustrated by this worry, although he acknowledged that anyone unfamiliar with her fitness might see it as a risk to start so quickly. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe began to calculate her finish time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. After running 41 kilometers at a fast pace, she managed to sprint the last stretch in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never expected anyone to come close to that time for a long time, and she thought, ""I will come back and do it next year."" Unfortunately, that did not happen.

After the race, everyone was curious about how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, had outperformed the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had spent weeks with Radcliffe, providing daily training sessions to support her as she covered 250-300 kilometers each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle that level of pain like her. She would push me to my limits; I had to ice my thumbs afterward because I was in so much pain."" Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for pleasantries; she was ready for a two-hour training session. ""Paula would push you to give everything you had. That's what made her exceptional."" 

During this time, Hartmann dedicated so much to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful. When asked if she knew why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe replied, ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany (a two-time London marathon winner) might break through. Maybe it's because people are competing against each other instead of focusing on their own performance."" She explained, ""That mindset of never easing up, even when you’re winning, probably helped me because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always about pushing as hard as I could."" Radcliffe did not realize at the time that this marathon was the peak of her career, and she would never run that fast again. However, she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. At that time, there was a lot of discussion about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain. I believed we had created a series that truly contributed to this movement, but I still worried: would people enjoy a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both excited and anxious. Fortunately, I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful, leading to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I later wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving passports, suitcases, and travel plans. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who has dedicated his life to making the best golden pasta. These artisans have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. 

Perfection is very personal. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to feature in the series was challenging, and I knew I would disappoint some people by not including their favorites. I could imagine them asking, “Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that would satisfy everyone. This experience reinforced my belief that each person has their own view of perfection, shaped by their emotions, memories, and environment. Despite the book’s title, I knew I wouldn’t claim that the recipes were the ultimate versions. I believed that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. 

The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. It’s about trying ideas and refining them until something unique emerges. The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen in restaurants before. I was excited to delve into memory and nostalgia in food because I started my career in a similar way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, such as visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that was so far from perfect that we had to stop filming there! While perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow, using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van suddenly made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking like he knew what he was doing. Finally, he said, “Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,” and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried and said, “We can’t stay here forever.” The field was empty, just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea, saying, “No, we can’t stay here forever.” We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass and said, “Tell us a story.” Bea lay down next to her and encouraged me to tell a story. So, I shared a story about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I described their conversation about breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. Bea said, “That’s silly, no one understands bird language.” My eyes felt teary. I replied, “I do,” but I didn’t sound very sure. Bea called me a liar, and I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I started to doubt myself and turned to Mum for help, but she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John returned with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a nearby hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out, but the boys waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was a little away from the road. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be expensive.” Mum reassured him, saying, “We’ll just have some tea,” and we sat down in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot and said, “It’s like syrup in there.” We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine with a worried expression. When it started to get dark, he said, “I guess it’s a miracle we made it this far.” 

Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on solid ground. John said, “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech.” Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind us with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home since our van had to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then, I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in the hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike her, they were not competing. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke good English. They discussed the music they were playing, their recent travels, and their future plans. 

“I think I’m doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy mentioned, trying to sound impressive. However, she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she was no longer officially enrolled. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which selected only fifteen pianists her age from thousands of applicants. She had made it in, and her dad celebrated by buying her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant. Her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mother had filled out the application and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to give her the chance to say no. Back then, she believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in, seeming surprised. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag; it was hard to know when sharing her achievements was just fitting in or showing off. “It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying…” Liesel/Louisa then looked across the room, as if she saw someone she needed to talk to, and left. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, shaggy hair, like many musicians, showing they were both music lovers and a bit rebellious. “Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. He started to respond when Lucy's grandfather appeared beside her. 

“Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, pulling her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition,” Lucy replied. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather insisted. He took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said. 

Later, in the elevator to their suite, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” She liked that. Being recognized felt good, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she received. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from her school friends. Even her best friend, Reyna, wouldn’t care that she could play a difficult Rachmaninov piece perfectly. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘Spending too much time online isn’t good for you. You should spend more time in the real world,’ said my dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I decided to look into what experts say about this topic, and I found it quite interesting. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have a large group of real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are developing important technical skills needed in today’s digital world. 

Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, explains that ‘social networking is now a key part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media casually like adults do; they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, describes it as ‘the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where parents used to share jokes and gossip. It serves a similar purpose: helping teenagers form their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues while connecting with their peers.’ 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson states, ‘Adolescence is a time for self-discovery. Social networking can help you figure out who you are: you can share your favorite music or sports, find out what you enjoy, and see that others have different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can be helpful for shy individuals: ‘Communicating online can feel easier than in person, and it allows you to practice social skills in a less intimidating setting.’ 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can be beneficial for quiet individuals with specific interests because they connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But finding a social networking group of similar people can change that, making you feel more connected and popular in a different way,’ he says. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared an interesting point: ‘Young people who discover new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals, and create their own content are truly making the most of social networks.’ She believes social networking is becoming a creative outlet: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are also enhancing creativity, allowing photographers to connect, learn, share images, and deepen their skills. ‘This all improves employability and will be beneficial in the workplace,’ she says. 

‘Every business uses social media to promote and build brand awareness – understanding how it works is essential. For instance, if you create a product and have 1,000 friends on various social networks, they could all be potential customers. Linking these networks can create your customer base.’ 

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they enter the workforce, Matthews agrees. ‘One great feature of many sites is the chance to collaborate with others to create and share content. Collaboration is a vital skill in the 21st century and is important for being employable in a digital world.’"""
110,"When people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet getaway when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he thought was the ultimate family bonding experience, which my twin brother and I found terrifying. “Not enough people do this anymore,” my parents kept saying, while we exchanged worried looks.

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. Still, I had some strategies to cope. With barely enough space left for us, we began “The Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our spacious home for smaller accommodations over the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we had gotten ourselves into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. The desert turned into mountains, and the days started to blend together, but each experience was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where the strong smell of sulfur hinted at what was to come. As we climbed to our next stop, we realized that the roads marked for Jeeps were best suited for actual Jeep drivers.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. Disappointment turned to laughter when we saw the huge “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. “Bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross, were common, and our close encounter with a bear (and a nervous park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories.

As we drove, life back home faded away. Even the hotel we stayed in, which was an old building with no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t dampen our excitement. In exchange for these inconveniences, I experienced some of the most beautiful views I’ve ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we began our journey back south. My parents were right: you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something amazing. 

Returning home was a mix of emotions, but at least I hadn’t argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our adventure to look through, and I knew that the memories I would cherish most were the unexpected and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy, because her family was separating for two years. Rose’s father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Meanwhile, Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so it was better for her to remain at the college where she had the best room, complete with a kitchen and study area. She also had free access to the Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not.

Rose, on the other hand, was moving in with her grandmother. She only had vague memories of Daisy from past holidays and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not very excited, but Daisy was happy to have Rose with her. There had been some disagreement between Rose’s parents and her grandmother in the past, which meant Rose had spent summers away from Daisy. The last time Rose saw her grandmother, she was only ten, but she remembered those times fondly. Dahlia had mentioned that living with Daisy would be interesting because Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not a typical frail old lady; she seemed to attend more social events than anyone else.

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She understood the importance of healthy eating, fitness, and sleep. However, she wanted one thing: her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without always asking for permission. She believed she could be trusted to handle these small things. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or curfews, and she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood this.

Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, which made Rose very happy. They all agreed that their relationship would be based on trust. Daisy would trust Rose to make mature decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it.

Rose was not a wild child; her few friends were similar, so her school reports were always good. In five weeks, she would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin a new chapter in her life. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years of school. For Rose, this was a new moment in her life, a new piece in the puzzle that was her journey."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed challenging, and she wasn’t aware of what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to give it a try. Now, the novel she started at that age is about to be published. Recently, she told her former teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. She had expected Charlotte to write a book when she was 30 or 40, but Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to pursue something she was good at.

On a winter afternoon, I met Charlotte in her publisher's office. I knew I was interviewing a 15-year-old about her book, but I was still surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a significant achievement; it has a strong and exciting story. The only thing that reveals its young author is the age of the main character. A public relations representative is present in case Charlotte needs support, but she doesn’t. She is confident, intelligent, and steady, showing no signs of overconfidence.

Charlotte is aware of the limitations of her youth. When I ask her about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She believes her age doesn’t limit her understanding of the world, but she doesn’t consider herself particularly wise. She is interested in the theme of taking responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often misrepresented in fiction. She identifies three common types of teenage characters: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the socially awkward teen. She finds it frustrating that there aren’t many stories about teenagers who are just fine. She feels that some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers don’t know who they are because they lack experience, which can harm their self-confidence.

Charlotte enjoys reading works by famous fantasy authors, but these books almost discouraged her from writing. She wondered if she needed to explore deep psychological themes to write well. However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which advises that if readers can guess what will happen next, the suspense is likely gone.

Some might argue that Charlotte’s parents, both journalists, played a crucial role in getting her novel published. Her father’s connection in publishing helped her book get read initially. She recognizes her good luck, as it is challenging for any new writer to have their first novel read. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, it’s up to you. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show off, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He approached the ramp quickly and flew into the air, arms waving. Even we could see something was off. We held our breath. He landed hard, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly reminded us, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ Maybe freestyle skiing wasn’t for me. On past ski trips, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow, but I wasn’t one of those teenagers who did tricks in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I worried that if I tried to join them, I would be laughed at. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a large indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, where students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits – not exactly a realistic start for what awaited us on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their skills for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan cheerfully promised. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ Gareth explained. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope steepens for landing. If you land in the right zone, you keep moving forward, which reduces the impact. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain’s fears and go straight towards the jump. My legs seemed to want to go backward as I neared the launch point, so I ended up landing on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday, I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ Gareth advised. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would dislike being indoors while looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises mimicked ski-jumping moves, while others taught us ‘aerial awareness’ – understanding what your body is doing while spinning in the air. Gareth provided a running commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off and then found myself lying in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more challenges before I finally landed correctly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I forced myself to keep my speed up as I approached the jump, took off, and landed correctly. Then I noticed both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty from fear, and you grip the harness tightly. Suddenly, the ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There’s a pause, then a sudden drop that makes your stomach feel weightless. You rush forward, turn sharply to the left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream in fear. But you chose to be here, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks.

What surprises me is how amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, have become a massive industry. To create the excitement and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers, designers, and marketing professionals working behind the scenes. The idea of being a ""rollercoaster designer"" might sound like a childhood dream, but it is actually a complex job. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping riders safe, and they need to introduce new elements to keep people coming back.

While many think rollercoasters have become more extreme, most of the techniques used today, like the wheels that allow rides to go upside down, were developed by American designer John Miller in the early 20th century. During his time, there were fewer safety regulations, and some rides were quite uncomfortable for passengers. Now, designers must work within the limits set by specialized ride manufacturers.

I spoke with three experts in rollercoaster design. Professor Brendan Walker, a ""thrill engineer"" with a background in aeronautics, explained that the skill lies in putting all the elements together. Dr. John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, added that it’s about quickly alternating between feelings of excitement and safety, so riders feel thrilled but not unsafe. 

To create an outstanding ride, teams must develop a strong story, whether it’s a space adventure or a jungle chase, that complements any new features like the tallest drops or most twists. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, intuition, experience, and trial-and-error are crucial. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that it helps to be passionate about thrills to understand what riders want and to test rides before they open to the public.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would need to adopt new technologies like virtual reality. Walker responded that while virtual reality can enhance the experience, it is not a replacement for the physical thrill of the ride. He believes that the core experience of rollercoasters will remain the most important aspect for many years to come."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating performances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally, which makes me wonder why she fits both roles into her busy life. She explains, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the instructions of demanding choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget how it feels to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, she takes on a teaching role and enjoys working with young dancers. “Beginners are often open to trying new ideas. In some ways, it’s easier to work with them than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They are eager to succeed but don’t yet fully understand their strengths and weaknesses. This lack of clarity helps them accept even tough criticism. However, they might still question my advice, and I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, letting the music guide her. “There might be music I don’t like, but I still strive to create the best dance routine for it. If the dancers don’t connect with a certain piece, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece of music. Ideally, I would like to experiment more and switch to different pieces, which would help improve the atmosphere during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I often work on large productions where the music is already decided and cannot be changed.”

Miranda believes in building connections with new people rather than sticking to one institution. “It’s important to meet new people, but I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my approach each time I work somewhere new, which helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

We discuss a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,” Miranda says. “This one tries to show the real life inside a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer receives endless corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that struggle. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch, but it’s genuine. The public often underestimates the hard work and dedication required in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. “It’s when everything the company has put together – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. While perfection is hard to achieve, aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help you overlook some artistic mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps were excellent, but distracting costumes or props were disappointing.”

Given her diverse work, I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? “People like to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s a trend to focus on becoming an expert in a narrow field, but I don’t follow that. Maybe one day I’ll be known for one thing, but for now, I want to broaden my horizons.”"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on television. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main focus of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to it, attaching them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I placed my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even spending one night on the beach. Several friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to keep going. I have done many walking trips in recent years, but this was completely different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads, which allowed me to stop at roadside cafés and enjoy a cappuccino on the sofa instead of having my sandwiches blown away while sitting on a rock. I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually travel with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be a good idea. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still seemed confused, he smiled and showed me on board.

Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would follow us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first proper swim of 1.5 km. I felt nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves became bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. However, I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The following days had a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the scenery. As the swims became longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. I felt less need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come back again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant is not an easy job, but it has many rewards. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting, which makes it a great job for someone young like me!

As a child, I attended a boarding school far from my family, so I often flew alone at the beginning and end of each term. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed with me and inspired me to leave my banking job and find a new career.

During the interview for this job, I met many other young people, many of whom were also changing careers. They were often very qualified, just like me. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I wanted to stand out, so instead of just saying I loved to travel, I talked about my skills and past work experience. This approach helped me get the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because it has many benefits, although the free flights are not the main reason. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: ""no one’s finished until everyone’s finished."" It feels like a big family; even if we don’t see each other often, we are still close. When I’m off duty, I don’t have to take work home with me. If I do encounter difficult passengers, which is rare, I remind myself that the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy watching the children achieve things they never thought they could. Most of them already know how to swim and play table tennis, but rock climbing is a new challenge for many. Some kids feel nervous at first, but with a little encouragement, they decide to try, and eventually, they all reach the top. This accomplishment makes them feel fantastic.

At the start of the week, some children miss their homes. Interestingly, it’s not the younger ones who struggle the most; it’s usually those aged ten to thirteen. We limit their mobile phone use. We tell them they can call home after lunch, but when they ask again later, we say it’s too late and suggest they call tomorrow. Most children adjust within a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they come to thank us for a wonderful time.

Sometimes, it’s not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who frequently call to check on their kids, which is often unnecessary. Their children are usually busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to ask the parents to call back later.

We often see a specific type of child at camp, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into more appropriate attire, but soon they understand why it’s important."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be skilled musicians. It opened in London last year after five successful years in the USA, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was not easy. The UK has stricter rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. As a result, the production needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors based in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

Even though the London theatre is larger than the one in the USA, it has been full every night, with audiences eager to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are, mentioning, ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

I asked Jamie what his classmates thought of the show. He replied, ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’ When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to join him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was relieved that the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes!

Although the young actors were already musicians, with some playing multiple instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the challenging part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
