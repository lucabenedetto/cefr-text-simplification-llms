Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins. Public check-ins are when you tell everyone online where you are. The website said that when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are. Some of these people might not be good to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides. 
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with many people. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can lose control and feel lost. This can be sad, but we should not give up. There are lessons from people who used the internet a long time ago. 
In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. At that time, the internet was mostly for students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his life, so he created a blog. He wrote about everything and shared many photos. People liked to read his blog because he was brave and shared many things. 
One day, people went to his blog and saw a sad video instead of his usual posts. Hall had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to stop blogging or lose his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. 
In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can have real-life consequences. 
Armstrong was sad and stopped blogging for a while, but later she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps her family. 
The lesson is that the internet lets us say many things, but we should think carefully before we share. 
**Questions:**
1. What is a public check-in?
2. Who is Justin Hall?
3. What happened to Justin Hall when he wrote about his love?
4. What did Heather Armstrong write about in her blog?
5. What is the lesson we learn from this text?"

Some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot we do not understand about our universe. Scientists can be a bit proud, but even they do not know everything about the universe. Some scientists warned people about the film, calling it “atrocious” and “dangerous.” This made me want to see the movie.
At first, I did not understand why the film was so important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we thought. Then, the film talked about how water molecules can be changed by thoughts. I had heard that a Japanese researcher showed that the shape of water molecules can change based on people’s thoughts. The film showed pictures of ice crystals that looked nice when someone was happy and looked bad when someone was in a bad mood. Many people find this interesting, but scientists often say, “Give me a break.” 
The idea that water can be changed by thoughts is amazing, but we need real proof. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have energy that comes from nowhere, which could be linked to a force that is making the universe expand. This idea comes from many years of research in labs and observatories around the world.
Scientists are making discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we thought. Astronomers found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called “dark energy.” Other discoveries are also surprising. Neuroscientists found that our brains take about half a second to understand what is happening around us. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans began and how they spread around the world. Some scientists think there is a link between life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Science is not finished. In fact, we know less than we thought. Many natural events are harder to understand than we believed. New ideas about chaos and uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the best physicists are trying to create a “Theory of Everything” to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. Many people believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible.

3,C2,"""Writing novels is hard for me, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a big forest, while writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. The trees in the forest give shade, and the leaves can be bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colors attract bees and butterflies. 
Since I started writing, I have often switched between novels and short stories. After I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. After I finish short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write short stories when I am writing a novel, and I never write a novel when I am working on short stories. Writing these two types of stories uses different parts of my brain, and it takes time to change from one to the other.
I began my career with two short novels in 1975. From 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I did not know much about writing short stories then, so it was hard, but it was a great experience. I felt my imagination grow. Readers liked this new side of me. One of my first short stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first collection called Tales from Abroad. This was how I started writing short stories.
One reason I enjoy writing short stories is that they do not take a long time to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to write a short story, but I can change it many times. Writing a novel takes a year or two, and it can feel very long. Sometimes I wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change for me.
Another good thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It feels like jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. Also, with short stories, you do not have to worry about failing. If an idea does not work, you can just move on. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver have stories that are not perfect. This makes me feel better. You can learn from mistakes and use that in your next story.
When I write novels, I try to learn from what works and what does not in my short stories. Short stories help me experiment with ideas. It is hard to try new things in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder for me. My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories show my feelings, and I am happy to share them with my readers."""

Science is a way to understand the world. It helps us in many ways, like curing diseases, but it can also create problems. Science tries to explain everything, from tiny ants to the universe. It has influenced many people, including poets and leaders. Sometimes, people do not understand science well, and its importance can be seen in different ways. 
Science has changed a lot over time. Old ideas are often replaced by new ones. This change can be difficult. Scientists can feel jealous or angry about each other’s ideas. The history of science is full of arguments. This book will talk about important ideas in science and how they changed our thinking. We will look at these ideas and think about their beauty and limits.
Science is always changing. There is always a scientist who finds something new that changes what we thought before. Most of the time, these changes do not disturb society. But sometimes, they can change our beliefs. For example, in the 1600s, scientists thought the universe worked like a big clock. Now, we know it is much more complicated. 
Some people think that science cannot explain everything. But when science changes, we often learn more about how nature works. For example, Isaac Newton explained more about the world than Aristotle did, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. Science makes mistakes, but it keeps trying. 
At the end of the 1800s, many scientists thought there was not much left to discover. But then they found new things like radioactivity, X-rays, and the electron. Biology has also made many discoveries. Now, some people believe we are close to finding a complete explanation of the universe. 
Science is important. In the last 200 years, we have gone from just watching nature to controlling it in some ways. Sometimes, this can upset the balance of nature. People who do not study science need to understand it because it affects our future. Science is part of how we think about and shape our world. The choices we make in science can affect many things, like health and the environment."

Since about 2015, many big book publishers have said that sales of ebooks are not growing as before. In some cases, ebook sales have even gone down. This has made people question if ebooks will be important in the future. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks may have led to bad investments, and his company lost trust in printed books. 
Even though it seems that ebooks and printed books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question is interesting and makes people talk a lot. Why do we think of ebooks and printed books as being in competition? The answers to these questions tell us more about how we feel about new technology and change.
In my research, I found that people often think one type of media will replace another when new technology comes out. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. The idea that books might disappear is not new either. In 1894, some people thought that the phonograph would replace books with audiobooks.
Many times, people have said that new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end printed books. Some people worried that this would be bad for culture, while others thought ebooks would be much better. The idea that books might disappear often comes up when new technology is introduced. This shows our mixed feelings about change.
We feel strong connections to different types of media, like books and televisions. Studies show that we can even name our cars or get upset when our computers don’t work. When new technology, like e-readers, comes out, it changes our relationship with things we love. As technology changes, we often miss the things we used to have. This is why some people still want older products.
For example, when the printing press was invented in the 15th century, people wanted original manuscripts. When movies changed from silent to sound in the 1920s, people missed silent films. The same thing happened when photography changed from film to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have made people appreciate the feel and smell of printed books more.
This should make people feel better about the future of printed books. However, the idea that books might disappear will continue to be a popular story about technology and change. One way we understand change is by using stories that are easy to remember, like stories of loss. The story of the death of the book shows both our excitement for new things and our fear of losing what we love.

Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some great thinkers from the last four hundred years did their best work. I wanted to show how they organized their time to be creative and productive. By writing about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to give a new view of their personalities and careers. 
The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I say, “Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap.” This book is about the daily habits of creative people, not just their work. It is also personal. The writer John Cheever said that you show something about yourself when you write, and I believe this is true.
I have questions that I think about in my own life: How can you do important creative work while making money? Is it better to focus on one project or to work a little each day? When there is not enough time, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not have all the answers, but I want to show how many successful people faced similar problems. 
The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. A routine can seem boring, but it can help you use your time and energy better. The psychologist William James said that good habits can help us focus on important things. Ironically, he was a procrastinator and had trouble keeping a regular schedule.
This book started because of my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was at my job at a small architecture magazine, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a “morning person” and can focus well in the morning, but I struggle in the afternoon. That day, I began to look online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought someone should collect them. This led to the Daily Routines blog I started that afternoon and now this book.
The blog was simple; I shared people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I gathered more information and tried to keep it interesting. I let my subjects speak for themselves with quotes from their letters and diaries. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to thank the many biographers and journalists whose work helped me. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for further reading."

Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist when he was six years old. This happened after his father said they could not go on holiday to Spain because of money problems. Instead, they rented a small house on the beach in England. One day, on a rainy afternoon, Howard found an ammonite shell on the beach. He had always wanted to study ancient life, and by the end of university, he knew he wanted to study the very early creatures from a long time ago, not dinosaurs.
After finishing his studies, Howard worried about finding a job. He felt good about his skills, but he knew that sometimes good people do not get jobs. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied, but he did not expect much. 
On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help with the interview had a fight with his wife. He was upset and had an accident, so he could not come to the interview. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, took his place. This professor helped Howard get the job, even though Howard did not know him well. Howard was surprised but happy to get the job. Later, a colleague told him that the situation was not fair, but Howard was just glad to have the job.
Howard enjoyed his work because he could plan and do his research. However, his personal life was sometimes chaotic. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes while he was at the Underground station. He was very upset and went back to the college. He called to postpone his lecture and reported the theft. After that, he went for coffee and met a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. 
During this meeting, Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This was a big opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi.

Charles Spence will eat almost anything. He says, “We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home.” The ice cream may look strange, but it has a “slightly nutty, floral” taste. Spence is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. He and his team are trying to make eating bugs more acceptable. 
Spence’s work affects what we eat and drink. He helps big food companies and famous restaurants with their menus. He studies many things that can change how we taste food, like who we eat with, how food is arranged, and even the color and weight of plates and cutlery. For example, did you know that the first person to order food in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? And when we eat with one other person, we eat about 35% more food. If we eat with three people, we eat 75% more!
Spence’s lab in Oxford is simple. He uses basic tools and old audio-visual equipment. This helps him work with cooks who do not have much money for research. Most of his work is paid for by a big food company. In the past, some people thought that research funded by companies was not real science. But now, universities need to show that their work is useful, so this type of research is important.
Spence helps food brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. It is good for the companies because they want their customers to live longer. Many companies make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice. Spence says that when people know about the changes, they focus on the taste and often do not like it as much.
Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a food company. At first, people thought science and food did not go together. But Spence and Blumenthal worked together to create a dish called “Sound of the Sea.” Spence says that sounds can change how we taste food. For example, high-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. 
Soon, an airline will match music with the food they serve. Last year, a well-known brand made a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream melts. However, they did not match the music to the taste, which is often a problem.
What are dinner parties like at Spence’s home? One time, they ate rabbit with the fur around the cutlery. Another time, they played with colorful lights. They even had a dinner party with headphones and different drinks to see how the sounds changed the taste. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food events, and conferences are all part of his research.

Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, like facts, rumors, and opinions, and we have to figure out what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things than before. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do many of these things ourselves. We are trying to manage our work, families, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, and we use our smartphones to help us. 
But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we try to do many things at the same time, we are really just switching quickly from one task to another. This can make us less efficient. 
Multitasking can also increase stress in our bodies. It can make us feel confused and tired. Our brains like new things, so it is easy to get distracted by them. This makes it hard to focus on one task. 
Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. This means we can think less clearly. If students do homework while watching TV, they may not remember the information well. Without distractions, they can remember better.
Making decisions is also hard for our brains. Small decisions, like whether to answer a text, can take a lot of energy. After making many small decisions, we might make bad choices about important things. 
Many people, including business leaders and scientists, talk about the problem of too many emails. It is not just about emails themselves, but the huge number of messages we receive. One scientist’s son said his father answers emails for a living, and this is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and get other things done.

1. What do we have to do with the information we receive?

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night. He did this to throw pieces at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they cannot give birth properly. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. They believed animals just acted in ways that could be measured, and science only looked at those actions. The idea that animals have feelings and thoughts was not taken seriously. 
But now, this is changing. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals have emotions. This topic is now being studied more. Some popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s *Wild Justice* and Victoria Braithwaite’s *Do Fish Feel Pain?*, talk about this. This has started a debate: do animals have thoughts and feelings like humans? 
There is also a question about conscience, which is a person’s sense of right and wrong. In a recent study with cows, those that opened a locked gate for food seemed happier than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? People agree on what they see, but they do not agree on what it means. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote *Second Nature*, believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks we are close to a big change in how we think about ethics, like when slavery ended. 
Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should think again about how animals think. He believes animals have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings on animals. These three people may never agree because the main issue is not just science or morals, but philosophy. It is hard to define what consciousness is. Can we ever know what it is like to be a bat?
Balcombe did an important experiment that he believes shows that starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were put into two groups. One group had nice cages with space and water, and the other group had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid bad worms from another. But when only bad worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe thinks that being in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life.
Balcombe has worked with animal rights groups and has strong opinions. He says, “We look back and feel bad about racism. One day, we will feel the same about how we treat animals. We cannot support animal rights while eating meat.” If he were the only one with this opinion, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning has written a book about animal behavior. He says, “We are changing our views. In the past, some people thought animals thought like us, but now we are seeing things differently. This is a complicated topic, and we should listen carefully to different opinions.”

Critical thinking is a way to understand better what we read or hear. Adrian West, a research director, says that arguing can help us find the truth. Technology helps us store information and manage a lot of data, but it can also make it harder to think deeply about problems. West mentions that we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More information does not always mean we make better decisions. 
According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading books, and this is happening faster now. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media, like videos and games, may hurt our critical thinking. People are spending more time on quick media and doing many things at once instead of focusing on one thing.
We do not yet know exactly how technology affects critical thinking. Technology has changed how we think, and it can be both good and bad. For example, a computer game can help us think critically or make it harder to think deeply. Reading online can improve our analysis skills, but clicking on many links can distract us.
Greenfield says that reading helps our thinking and imagination more than visual media like video games and TV. Reading helps us think critically and learn new words. However, she also found that some visual media can help us process information. Unfortunately, many visual media do not give us time to think or reflect.
Many young people may not reach their full potential because of this. How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. There is a debate about video games and learning. James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games can be good for kids. They are not just entertainment; they can also help us learn. Some games teach decision-making and thinking skills in fun ways. 
In the digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand better how technology affects our thinking and analysis."

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job because he was unhappy with working in an office. He has written books about work and how to live in today’s world. In his latest book, he talks about how hard it is to focus because of many distractions around us. 
One day, while shopping, he saw ads on a credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. This made him think about how we are often distracted and cannot focus on what we want. He believes that we are not always aware of these distractions. Because of this, it is harder to think and remember conversations. People often avoid talking to strangers because they want to avoid interruptions.
Crawford says that we see the world through things like video games and apps, which can take over our lives. Many people complain about emails at work but still check their emails in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to pay attention. 
Crawford thinks that technology is not the only problem. He believes it makes us more focused on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control what we do. For example, people prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. He worries that by only interacting with screens, we might lose important connections with real people.
He gives an example from his gym. In the past, there was one music player for everyone, which could cause some disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with ear buds. This has made the gym less of a social place. 
Crawford has two ideas to help with these problems. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, he believes we should practice skills that help us connect with the real world. For example, cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers must focus on real things. They cannot replace the real feeling of their activities with anything else.
Crawford says that when we engage with the real world, we see that fake experiences are not as good. He does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment. Focusing on one thing can help us pay attention to other things better."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question. We often say what our job is. But if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit difficult. Saying ""I am a philosopher"" can sound a bit showy. It is better to say that you study or teach philosophy. Many people think philosophers know special truths, but this is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else.
One reason people think this way is that philosophers often judge what others do and talk about thinking. A famous Greek philosopher, Aristotle, said that thinking about life is very important. Many modern philosophers do not agree, but people still connect philosophy with deep thinking.
Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that a life without thinking is not worth living. This means that just following what everyone else does can make life less satisfying. Thinking helps us control our lives and make our own choices. However, you do not need to read many books or be very smart to think about your life. It just means looking closely at your daily experiences to see if they are important.
Philosophy should help everyone, but sometimes it feels far away from real life. This is partly because academic philosophy has become very complicated and hard to understand. Philosophers often talk to each other and not to regular people. This makes philosophy seem distant from everyday life.
I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I study ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. Recently, I feel this title does not fully describe my work. Ethics is often seen as related to rules and laws. But there is more to ethics. It also looks at whether certain actions are fair or not.
For example, we might discuss if downloading movies illegally is wrong (it is) and then talk about responsibility and how we view art. Philosophy can help people think more about their actions and beliefs. Sometimes we might find out we already know the answer; other times, we may realize our beliefs are not easy to explain. By thinking about these ideas, we can help everyone.

People who love food, like foodies and chefs, often think about how we eat and what we eat. This can make eating more enjoyable. In the past, when philosophers talked about food, they usually used it to explain other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, discussions about food seem to be about food, but they often talk about other things too.
One famous philosopher, Epicurus, believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. He talked about many activities, but people now often connect his name with enjoying food and drink. You can see his name in restaurants and food shops. These businesses hope that if they use his name, people will buy their food.
Food is also social and cultural. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with our communities. These communities help us grow and share food. We interact with food more than with other things, so it is a good topic to think about.
When food is ready, critics write and talk about it. Some people wonder why food critics are important. One philosopher said that tasting food is not a special skill; critics are just better at describing how food tastes. Most discussions about how we see things focus on sight, but we should also think about taste.
Another interesting point is about beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but we don’t usually say that about food. Some philosophers think that because food is becoming more popular, it should also be talked about in discussions of beauty, like art or poetry. However, food is eaten and gone, while art can last a long time. This makes it hard to say food is beautiful in the same way.
There are also many important questions about food. For example, what should we eat? Should we choose organic, free-range, or vegetarian foods? Our choices often show our beliefs. Philosophers like to ask why we make these choices, and this is a good topic to discuss.
Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their friends and family. When we cook at home, everyone shares food and time together. But restaurant cooks have to follow rules for their jobs. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and they work with colleagues, not friends.
A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" talks about how food can help people from different cultures connect. We can learn to enjoy other people's food and build friendships by eating together. This idea has been important in international relations for a long time. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make food philosophy exciting for everyone."

Rob Daviau is from the US and he makes special board games called ‘legacy’ games. He thought that the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. So, he started to think about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a story and if choices made in one game could affect the next game. 
He changed a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made by players during the game have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, change the game board, or open new packets with new rules at important moments. The game is played over several sessions, and players can remember past actions. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”
Later, he worked on a legacy version of another popular game called Pandemic, where players work together to cure diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. Pandemic Legacy was very popular, but many people thought SeaFall was a big test for legacy games because it was a new idea. In SeaFall, players are sailors in a time when ships were important (from the 16th to the 19th century) and they explore new lands.
Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make to keep the story interesting. They ask people to test the games to see how they work. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. At first, the game is great, but after a few games, it can start to break. Then you have to fix everything.”
Legacy games were not expected to be very popular. Daviau thought it would only be liked by a few people. He said, “I thought it was different and good, but it was strange and broke many rules. I thought I would be known for this unusual project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, really liked the idea. He thinks it is one of the best changes in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of excitement. There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than to learn a new game.”
Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the fun of a new adventure was more important than worrying about how long the game lasts. He mentioned that people don’t usually watch the same movie twice in the cinema. “You’re buying into an experience,” he said. Legacy games also take ideas from video games and popular TV shows. 
When he was in college, Daviau wanted to be a TV writer, but he ended up in advertising and then game design. He still loves telling stories. Matt Leacock, who created Pandemic, said that making a legacy game is like writing a book. “You need to know how you want it to end and where you want it to start,” he said. 
Daviau feels proud of his work but is curious to see what others will do with the idea. He thinks that soon players will want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the company that published SeaFall, believes that the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."

One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky climbed out of his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and many people shared it online. 
People enjoy stories like this because they like to think that animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart, and they can do many interesting things. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play games. 
Dr. Frans de Waal studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees. He believes that we often do not see how smart animals are. He says that animals can think about the past and the future, feel empathy, and understand what others want. This means animals are smarter than we think.
In the past, people believed that animals were smart. For example, in medieval Europe, animals could be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, said that the difference between humans and animals is not so big. 
In the twentieth century, many people thought animals were just machines that respond to rewards and punishments. This idea made people forget that animals have feelings and thoughts. During this time, humans also harmed animal habitats and did not care about animal welfare.
Now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand that animals are intelligent in their own way. He says that we are learning more about animal intelligence every day. 
He believes that tests for animal intelligence should consider what each animal can do best. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts. 
In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery says that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we fail, the octopus might think we are not very smart.
Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found a way to escape to the ocean. He knows that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate how smart animals are. He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they can feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers got very upset. 
This study was published in a scientific journal, but a video of the experiment made more people believe the findings. This shows how our minds work in special ways. 
**Questions:**
1. What did Inky the octopus do one night?
2. Why do people enjoy stories about animals like Inky?

Robots were once only in stories about the future, but now they are changing our world. Robots have been used in car factories and other industries for many years. Experts say that soon, robots will be used in many more areas, and many people are not ready for this change. 
Many people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do in the next 50 years. However, most people also believe that their jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Every job will be affected by robots in the coming years. For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has made a robot named Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, which would take two human workers a whole day to do. 
Another example is a robot called Tally, made by a company in San Francisco. Tally walks around supermarkets to check if the shelves are full and the prices are correct. It does not clean the aisles, as some might think. 
Supporters of robots say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means there will be new jobs for people who can work with robots. But some people worry that we need to keep the human touch in jobs. They think society is not ready for the changes that robots will bring. 
Dr. Jing Bing Zhang is an expert on robots and their use in business. He studies how robots will change jobs in the future. His recent report says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and able to work with other robots and humans. In three years, many big companies will have a special person in charge of robots. In five years, salaries in the robot industry will go up by 60%, but there will still be many jobs that cannot be filled because there are not enough skilled workers. 
Zhang says that robots will affect lower-skilled workers, which is sad. He believes that these workers need to learn new skills instead of waiting for the government to protect their jobs. People cannot expect to do the same job for their whole lives anymore. 
New technologies will create new types of robots that we have never seen before. These robots will live with us in our homes and interact with us in new ways. This is a big chance for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe. 
With many jobs at risk, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future with robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive. 
**Questions:**
1. What is the name of the robot that can lay bricks quickly?
2. What does the robot Tally do in supermarkets?
3. What does Dr. Jing Bing Zhang study?
4. Why do some people worry about robots taking jobs?
5. What do developed countries need more of to stay competitive?"

George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He answered, ""Because it’s there."" This answer shows that many people want to know why someone would take such a big risk to climb a mountain. Some people might feel inspired by his answer to follow their own dreams. Climbing can be about adventure and having fun.
In 1967, a Bolivian writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He talked about seven different types of climbing, from playing on small rocks to climbing big mountains like those in the Himalayas. Each type of climbing has its own rules. This idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, including in magazines and conversations.
Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. However, climbing can also be very difficult. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not a fun experience. This shows that climbing can be both freeing and limiting. Some people believe that having fewer choices while climbing can actually give climbers a sense of freedom.
Joe Fitschen, a US rock climber, thinks we should ask, ""Why do people climb?"" instead of just ""Why climb?"" He believes climbing is part of who we are as humans. We like to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it is risky. The joy of climbing is connected to our nature.
Another writer, Brian Treanor, says that climbing can help us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He believes these qualities are very important in today’s world. Climbing can help us grow and live better lives outside of climbing.
Some expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson, believe that climbing alone is harder and deserves more recognition than climbing with a team or using extra help, like bottled oxygen. However, this idea has caused some debate because it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.
Climbing can also be understood in different ways. Many climbers talk about being in the moment or feeling a flow while climbing. The physical effort, focus, and problem-solving in climbing are similar to ideas in Zen philosophy, which teaches how to find peace of mind. This gives us another reason to think about why people are attracted to climbing."

Alfred Brendel is a famous pianist who played classical music for over sixty years. He was very smart and serious, and he played many important piano pieces. He wrote a lot of music but did not teach many students. People who knew him saw that he could be fun, but he was usually serious in his concerts. He spent his time studying, traveling, and performing.
About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked him for piano lessons. At first, Brendel did not think this was a good idea because he had very few students. He thought, “You don’t ask a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” But when he heard Kit play, he changed his mind. Kit was about 14 years old and played very well from memory. He even gave Brendel a CD of his performance, which was beautiful. Brendel thought, “I need to make time for him.”
Now, Kit is 19 years old and is always busy. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, and plays tennis. His mother is always with him. Kit also composes music. Brendel says this is important because writing music helps you learn to read it better. He noticed that Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. Kit listens carefully to his own playing and understands Brendel’s lessons.
Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He does not like it when newspapers call Kit the best pianist of the 21st century. He thinks this can be harmful. Young musicians can play some things very well, but they need time to improve on others. 
Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says that when he was young, he did not want to be famous quickly. He wanted to achieve certain goals by the time he was 50. When he turned 50, he felt he had done most of those things but still wanted to do more. Even though he cannot play as much now, he still thinks about music and enjoys his new life. 
**Questions:**
1. How long did Alfred Brendel play classical music?
2. What did Kit Armstrong ask Brendel at the concert?
3. Why did Brendel change his mind about teaching Kit?
4. What other activities does Kit do besides playing the piano?
5. How does Brendel feel about newspapers calling Kit the best pianist?"

When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My Grandad’s garden was by a river. It sloped down to the water. You could not reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a peaceful escape. 
Grandad’s garden was simple. He did not have a big greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames. They used plastic to cover broken glass. 
At home, my father was quiet. He was not serious all the time. He liked to say funny phrases, like “It’s immaterial to me.” He could have said “I don’t mind,” but he liked the word “immaterial.” My father left school without any qualifications and became a plumber. He did not love plumbing; it was just a job. He was not very ambitious, but he and my mother thought about moving to Canada once, but it did not happen. 
My father was good at fixing things at home. He could build bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once. But my mother liked to change the furniture often. Just when you got used to one chair, a new one would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I was not allowed to play the piano; my sister had lessons instead. When I asked my mother why, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”
I liked the river the most when I could choose between moors, woods, or the river. I could imagine another world by the river. I would take a fishing net and wear old sandals with the front cut out for my toes. I walked along the riverbank looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and have a picnic. I would look for fish in the water to catch with my net. After trying to keep them alive in the yard, I had to put them back in the river.
I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed hard until one day my father said, “There is a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.” In that moment, my father surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I think he hoped I would do well as a gardener. Even though he did not like gardening, he saw how much I enjoyed it."

Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. A strong wind is blowing, and it feels like we might be blown off the cliff and into the ocean below. But Lawrence’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and Lawrence pets him gently. The wind is loud, but Lawrence is happy on his island. 
Lawrence shows me around. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It rains a lot there.” I see dark clouds and rain on Rum’s big mountains. “Beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 
Suddenly, Lawrence says, “I have sheep to move.” We walk down the hill. He tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide. The geese eat a lot of grass, and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. 
While moving the sheep, Tie is not doing a good job. Lawrence says, “Away to me, Tie,” which means the dog should go to the right. But Tie goes straight through the sheep, causing confusion. Lawrence sounds disappointed. 
The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can play outside and sail boats in the summer. “They go out and come back when they are hungry,” Mary says. 
But life on the island has some problems. There is electricity only sometimes. On my first night, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary making breakfast with a flashlight. I also have no mobile phone service. Mary tells me, “You can get a signal on the hill, but most people just put their phones away after a few days.” So I do the same. 
Everything on Muck feels special. A boat brings groceries and three musicians. They come to play music in the island’s tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, by the warm fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father bought a small farm on Soay without seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny went to manage it.” I ask if Jenny knew about farming. “She was good at typing,” he replies. 
I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well because most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, we have the fish on the table, and it is very tasty. 
The next morning, I have to take a ferry to another island. Many ferries have been canceled because of bad weather. If my ferry does not come, I will be stuck on Muck for two more days. But secretly, I wish for that to happen."

The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and self-taught people. Many people thought video games were just a hobby for young fans. Now, the video game industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into this industry. Making video games based on new movies needs many team members and a lot of skill and hard work.
Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says, “It is hard to get a job in big companies or to change big games. But the industry needs game designers now more than ever. They need not just the top people who manage the whole game, but also the people who design parts of the game.”
So, how can you start a career in this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks differently. He says, “The best way is to make games. You need to create something to get a job. Game design is not just a job; it is a way of life. You must create to be real.”
Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it is more complicated. “Many people want to work in games, but few have the skills needed today. You need creativity, technical skills, and the ability to help the industry grow.”
Can you work alone? “Maybe, but it is hard,” says John. “A good course in games can help you and give you support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and then move up. They love all kinds of entertainment and art. They may have worked for a few years after school but know that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games.”
Connections can also help you get ahead in the game industry. This is important, just like in many other jobs. The idea of a young boy playing video games all the time is changing. Now, many families play games together on consoles and smartphones. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. “Games are popular with many people. They are also a fun way to learn, and I see many new opportunities in this area.”

23,B2,"""Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, and I am thankful for that. I had a friend who played with us, but his dad was very strict. He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play football. I am happy that I still love the game. 
When I score a great goal from far away, some people say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was young. You need to practice to score amazing goals. The best players in the world have talent, but they also practice a lot. 
Sometimes young players bump into each other, but I learned the right way to play. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning new skills. At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that education is important, but football was my main focus then. 
I don’t want my son to be like me. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still. I hope he does not just want to kick the books around. 
At the start of my professional football career, the manager helped young players like me to play for the first team. He never made a big deal about it, but we knew we had to do our best. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us realize we had to work hard. 
I trust my close friends and family a lot. Having money can sometimes cause problems. People ask me why I let my mother keep working. I help my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they do not want to just take money from me. My mum loves her job as a hairdresser, even if she does not earn much. 
I enjoy using my money to help my family. I have a lot of money, but it does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off to do things I have not done. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I break my leg while skiing, I cannot play football anymore."""

We lived at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He helped us find a cheap place to live because my father could not write anything in Los Angeles. Sam was worried about losing money and clients.
In the summer, the beach was empty because of the sea fog. Few people came to Reef Point. The road was not nice, and a better place, La Carmella, was nearby. Most people went there instead. Only those who had no money or loved surfing came to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people were at the beach. After being alone for months, we were now surrounded by people and activities.
My father was busy every day trying to write a script. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we did not have a dog. Rusty came to us and would not leave. I tried to send him away, but he always came back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he did not really want to scare him. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to?” My father said, “He thinks we belong to him.”
Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes he found things that were not his, like a sneaker or a beach towel. I had to give these back to their owners. Rusty also liked to swim. He always wanted to swim with me, even though I could swim faster. He never got tired of it.
One day, after swimming, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I played in the sea all afternoon. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and looked very good. One surfer caught my eye. She was better than the others. When she finished, she came to us and said, “Hi, why didn’t you join us?” I replied, “I don’t have a surfboard.” She said, “You could get one.” I answered, “I have no money.” 
“Are you British? Are you visiting?” she asked. I said, “No, I live here.” She asked, “Is your father American?” I said, “No, he came here to write a film script from a novel he wrote.” She was surprised and asked, “What’s his name?” I said, “Rufus Marsh.” She then said, “You mean, Tall as the Morning?” I nodded. She smiled and said, “I read that book!” Now she was interested in me, and I thought this was how it always was. People were friendly but only cared when I mentioned the book."

Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on the Queen Caroline ship. Her friend Annie had told her, “It’s better to arrive late. If you come too early, you will just wait.” Annie was a good traveler, but this time her advice was not good. 
After some time, an announcement said there was a problem with the computer system. The people waiting became unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted to enjoy it. Violet felt worried. She checked her bag and realized her phone was missing. This made her feel worse. She could not call the taxi company to see if she left her phone in the taxi because all her numbers were in her phone. 
Behind her, a friendly couple stood in line. Violet asked them, “I think I left my phone behind. Can I use your phone to make a call?” She called her son Harry and left a message for him to ask their neighbor Kristina to check if her phone was at home. If it was not there, she would have a problem because she needed her phone in New York. 
Finally, the line moved, and Violet gave her travel documents to the worker at the window. When she entered the ship, she felt disappointed. The inside looked like a fancy hotel but not a very nice one. There were shiny decorations and bright lights. 
Violet followed the signs to the elevators. The elevator was full of tired passengers. When it stopped at each floor, some people got out. At last, Violet reached the twelfth floor and stepped out. She was happy to see that her room had the balcony she wanted. She had worried about this, but now she felt relieved. She had paid a lot of money to make sure she had a nice view of the sea."

John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Vivian Maier, a street photographer. Maloof has collected many things from Maier’s life, including her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives. He also has 8mm movies and audiotapes.
One morning, Maloof looked at all the items he found. He felt lucky. He said, “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was. I could have sold it all to someone else.” Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families who knew her when she worked as a nanny and to people who developed her film.
Vivian Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always had a camera with her. She wore big coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier, said, “On her day off, she had her camera and we wouldn’t see her until late at night.” Maier had strong opinions about movies and politics.
Maier loved theatre and movies. She was not very social, but she walked the streets with her camera and talked to people. She recorded some of these conversations. She was very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. Rydzon said, “She was a true artist and followed her dreams.”
Maier’s work is real art; she did not create it for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. Photography expert Larry Silverman said, “Vivian has many interesting pictures.” He thinks her work shows the influence of other photographers. Maloof wonders if he will ever go through all the negatives he has stored in three fireproof cabinets. 
Before finding Maier’s work, Maloof was not interested in photography. After seeing her architectural photos, he started taking pictures himself. He said, “I realized that the people and street scenes were more important than I thought. I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make Vivian Maier known and get her into the history books.”"

When people say a novel is ambitious, they often mean it might not be very good. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, *The Luminaries*. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. 
Eleanor told me a story about being stopped at passport control. An official asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to him. The official looked at it and asked, “What is it about?” This is not an easy question for a writer. 
*The Luminaries* takes place in New Zealand in the 1860s. There are many crimes, and twelve men come together to solve them. The story is very complex. Eleanor wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past gave her many ideas for her characters. The book is more than 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good story.
When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said it feels nice to come from a small country. She feels that people at home share in her success. She also said it is annoying when people think her book is not serious. 
Eleanor wanted to write the book in a special way. She made each part half the length of the part before it, so the story speeds up as you read. I asked her if it matters if readers notice this. She said she wanted to create patterns in the book that readers could see if they wanted to.
Even with its special structure, *The Luminaries* is still an exciting murder mystery. Surprisingly, Eleanor did not know how the story would end when she started writing. She would write herself into difficult situations and then find creative ways to get out of them. She also wanted to make the book fun for readers.
We talked about her love for TV dramas. I asked if she would like to write for television. She said that could be cool. She was very excited when she talked about her writing and New Zealand. She noticed that being in a different place changes how she thinks. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busy cities to be around more people. But for now, New Zealand is still her home. I hope it gives her ideas for many more novels.

When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has built acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny loves the guitar. He wonders how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound. He learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood change the sound of the guitar.
Jonny built his first bass guitar, but he did not think about making guitars as a job at that time. He also liked painting and sculpture. After school, he went to university to study architecture because he liked design. But halfway through, he left because he wanted to do something different. He realized that making guitars is like making art, but it is also useful because people can play them.
Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he cleaned windows to earn extra money. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials, but later he became known as a good guitar maker and could charge more. Even now, after almost forty years, he says he is still just getting by. He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits how much money he can make.
In the beginning, Jonny worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals and let musicians try his guitars. He also had to learn how to price his guitars because he did not think about money much. Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar makers today. When he started, many people thought only American-made guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are respected too. 
Jonny thinks new guitar makers should take classes to learn important skills. However, he also believes that learning by trying and making mistakes is very important. He says it is good to look at other instruments and see what works and what does not. If you make the back of a guitar too thin or too thick, it will not sound good. If you learn from someone else, you may only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, you can learn many things."

When people talk about English conversation, they often start with the weather. A famous writer from the 1700s, Dr. Johnson, said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. Many people wonder why English people talk about the weather so much. They think it is because English people are very interested in it. 
However, some writers, like Bill Bryson from America, say that English weather is not very interesting. He points out that in England, there are not many exciting weather events like tornadoes or big storms. But another writer, Jeremy Paxman, disagrees. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that in England, you can never be sure what the weather will be like.
I think both Bryson and Paxman miss the real reason why English people talk about the weather. It is not just about the weather itself. When English people say things like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are ways to start a conversation or fill a pause. 
Talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other. There are three main times when they use weather talk: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a quiet moment and they need something to say. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather all the time. A conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to other topics, and go back to the weather when there is a pause. This is why many people think English people are obsessed with the weather."

Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was with her class of 12- and 13-year-olds. She wanted to explain how amazing it was that the Romans built this wall. It is 120 km long and 5 meters high, built about 1900 years ago. The students were excited about this trip. They chose it instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. But they wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice felt she did not have good answers for them. 
Alice could not find a good historical novel about life at the Wall in Roman times. So, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as a writer in 2001. She felt nervous but also excited. She said, “Teaching is like acting. It is hard work. Writing is exciting, but it is not so tiring.” Alice’s friends from teaching were happy for her because she still connects with children through her stories.
Alice wants her books to be different from many books for young people today. She thinks many of these books talk about sad things or are just fantasy, like Harry Potter. She wants her books to be real but also fun. Alice always taught English and History together. She loved to see when children went from being bored to being interested. 
Alice started writing because she felt she had time after her two sons left home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course. At first, Alice did not want to do it. But she had to send a story to the teachers before she could join the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours, she had 30 pages and sent it in. She was accepted into the course. 
During the course, other students read her story and gave her good feedback. They told her to publish it. Alice asked her school head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helps her with editing her work. Alice says, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rivals, but we work well together. He helps me change sentences and words. I like to add more scenes.”"

To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, to join a special race. In the beautiful Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and Alistair would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 
“I’m excited!” Jonny said at the start line. “I have never done this before. The views are beautiful, and it is cold, so I will be warm in the car.” Alistair was also excited, but he wore warm cycling clothes. “I have seen Jonny drive before, so I am not sure he will win. I might stop for tea on the way,” he joked.
The race started at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, which is very high up. Jonny’s car could go fast, but Alistair had to ride up a steep hill first. They quickly shook hands and began the race. Alistair rode away on his bike, while Jonny got in his car.
Jonny’s confidence went down quickly. Just 15 seconds into the drive, a big tractor came onto the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman. “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny drove on. 
Alistair was having a hard time. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill. Some sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top of the hill. The sun came out, and he started to ride faster.
In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The roads in the villages were very narrow. He had to drive slowly and even went through a small stream on the road. After leaving the last village, he drove straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close they were to each other.
As Jonny drove fast to the finish, Alistair was riding hard too. He reached the finish line and asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms and shouted, “Yes!” A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, looking disappointed. “I’m sad.”

When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the soft grass. You toss it up to serve and hit it. You can hear the sound of your own shots. The quietness helps me focus on the game. 
After a point is finished, the silence breaks with applause and cheers. I know there are many people watching, but I am very focused on the match. In 2008, I played Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final. This was the biggest match of my life. I had always wanted to play at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who is my coach, told me it is the most important tournament. 
When I was 14, I dreamed of playing there and winning. Before 2008, I had played Federer two times and lost. In 2006, I was happy just to be there, but in 2007, I was very sad after I lost. I knew I could have played better. I cried for a long time in the dressing room. Losing hurts, especially when you have a chance to win. 
Toni usually does not comfort me, but after my loss in 2007, he told me not to cry. He said there would be more chances to play at Wimbledon. I thought that was my last chance. I know that a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. 
In 2008, I had another chance. I felt confident that I had learned from my past loss. The night before the final, I had dinner with my family and friends. We did not talk about the match because I was already thinking about it in my mind. I wanted to keep that space for myself until the match started."

In early April 1957, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always wanted."" She spent most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 
In 1963, Jane became famous when Britain’s National Geographical Society made articles and TV shows about her research on chimpanzees. She wrote many books for the public, including children’s books and the popular book ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. 
Many stories about her life focus on her adventures and dreams, but they often do not show her real achievements. Jane Goodall is a pioneer in her field and is known as a leading zoologist. She helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We also learned that chimpanzees have emotions like humans and that they have different cultures in their communities.
Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" published in 1986, is an important work in chimpanzee research. Jane Goodall studied wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, for many years. Her work changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans.
Even as a child, Jane showed signs of becoming a biologist. When she was five years old, she disappeared one day. The police and her family searched for her. After a long search, she came back with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane said she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she hid in a henhouse for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."

In our first conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using different voices. She sounds like a funny 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. People who watch children’s TV and cartoons know her voices. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says. “I had to learn how to say many medical words quickly.” 
Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors think they can do funny voices, and some can,” she says. “But it is more than that. You have to make the script exciting for people who cannot see you. Many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions, but they often do not get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”
After school, Shirley took a drama course. She wanted to be an actor. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man at the recording studio asked me to try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and got the part!” Shirley found out she could do voices and thought voiceover work could be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”
Adult women often do the voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are higher than those of men. It is complicated to hire child actors, so companies prefer to use adult women. Shirley learned to make different sounds and to not always sound the same. She watches children’s TV to collect new voices. 
Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are hard because I have to sound excited about something I don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I learned that smiling while talking makes my voice sound happy.” When she works on animation, it feels like a holiday because she enjoys working with other actors.
The competition for voiceover work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording of what she can do – is very important. “It’s worth making a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she is successful because of her hard work and talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel or practicing your voices, it’s about setting goals and not giving up.”
For anyone who wants to do voiceovers, Shirley suggests going to special workshops. She thinks it is important to love voices. She describes herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been doing an American voice, it can stay with me for hours or even days,” she says. “My children are used to me talking in different voices.”"

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because many kids dream of being cartoonists, like they dream of being race car drivers. But most people stop dreaming and choose more practical jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do it.
Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to be one for a long time. I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, drew for school papers, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college. After I graduated, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons about local issues. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live on.
You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree or a lot of money, and you don’t even have to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it was that easy, there would be many more cartoonists. The skills needed to be a cartoonist are not hard to learn, but it is still a tough job. You should only try to be a cartoonist if you really want to do it. It is easier to get a regular job that pays well and gives you time for family and hobbies.
The more skills you have, the better chance you have to make a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also written, drawn caricatures, and done some design work. I take any job because you can learn a lot, even from work you don’t want to do. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about the world.
What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But now, most cartoonists have to sell their own work. The better you are at selling, the more successful you will be. I have seen cartoonists who are not very creative but are good at business do much better than those who are very talented but don’t know how to sell their work.
Many people worry about someone stealing their ideas, but they have never sold a cartoon. Some are so scared that they won’t even let others see their work! To protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will care about your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it can actually be a lucky break!"

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar from Japan. I usually don’t like to throw things away, so I felt bad about this. I took it to the dump and was going to put it in the rubbish when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I said yes, and he asked if he could have it. I said yes, and we went our separate ways. After that, I felt sad about giving it away.
A few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. That’s how I felt when I read an email from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes and sells guitars. He said, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name on a label on the guitar and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy! I would have given him anything, but his price was fair.
I remembered how my dad liked to put name labels on my things, including my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. But I didn’t get better at it, so I switched to the electric guitar, which was easier to play. At that time, punk music was also popular, and anyone could be a rock star.
When I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap on my shoulder because electric guitars are played while standing. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands knew what to do. My fingers felt a little pain from pressing the strings to play.
The electric guitar is not usually played alone. Now that I am learning it again, I think I should start a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers”!"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. I wrote a book called *Insomniac* about people who cannot sleep well. I wanted to warn people about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and feelings. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is. It is good that people are talking more about sleep now. 
But what about dreams? I have not heard much about dreams in this discussion. We often forget our dreams. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss the last hour or two of sleep. This lost sleep is mostly REM sleep, which is when we have the most dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. If a person lives for 90 years, they will spend about six or seven years in REM sleep.
When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they find that the next night, people have more REM sleep. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep. Many people agreed with the psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. But later studies showed that this was not so simple. Now, researchers focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. 
Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University, says that researchers do not agree on many things about dreams. Dreams are important. At a meeting of sleep experts, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study. This study found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. Pagel thinks that creative people use their dreams more. 
It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wonder if only creative people need their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways. Dreams can help us find new patterns and think differently. 
For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to think of a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They think of unexpected ideas. This is what creativity is. I write better when I wake up from strong dreams. Even a bad dream can help me think better. On those days, my ideas come out quickly. 
Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We all live in a complex world. We need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important. 
**Questions:**
1. What is the name of the book the author wrote?
2. Why is sleep important for us?
3. What happens when people wake up early and miss REM sleep?
4. Who remembers and uses their dreams better, according to Pagel?
5. Why do we need to dream?"

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small town by the sea in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see many empty frames on the walls and pictures of her two daughters. Susie is a talented artist who copies famous paintings. She can make copies of paintings from the early 20th century and the 16th century very well. 
""I don’t keep my own paintings,"" Susie says. ""As soon as I finish them, I sell them."" Susie is very busy. In her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted many famous artists' works, like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that experts sometimes think they are the real paintings. While the real paintings can sell for millions of pounds, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she works on them. 
Susie does not tell the names of her clients, but they include art galleries and private collectors. Some collectors love art, but others want to show off. One famous buyer likes to say he has a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. Susie says, ""Many famous people pretend my copies are the originals. That is their choice."" Some collectors keep the real painting in a safe place and show Susie’s copy instead.
Susie is honest about her work. When she copies an old painting, she tries to make it look as real as possible. She believes that doing a bad job would not be fair to the original artist. She puts her signature on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real painting, and even though some people make money this way, Susie has never wanted to do that. People who make fake art often get into trouble. 
Susie is not rich, and she has had hard times, but now her life is better. She does not want to risk her good name with collectors and artists. Susie did not always copy paintings. After she finished her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She earned very little money, but it helped her learn important skills. She had to be very careful and get things right the first time. She is happy she found a job that pays better.
When young artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and to be accurate. She has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants and make copies of old paintings, but she now focuses on French impressionist artists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 
Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie believes that impressionist artists worked hard and paid attention to detail. This makes their art difficult to copy. People wonder why Susie does not create her own art. She explains that her work comes from many years of practice, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried to make her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. 
Susie is a perfectionist, and she wants everything to be just right."

Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything else when she was a racer. She wanted to be the fastest person on the water. Since she was a child, the sea was her big passion. She felt a strong connection with her boats. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, life felt boring. People wanted to know about her races, but she just wanted to be back on the ocean, testing herself against nature.
After she came second in a big race called the Vendée Globe, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She took me into the tiny cabin where she lived for 94 days. She talked about how she planned everything carefully, even how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. She said preparation was very important. She showed me her food, a small gas stove, and medical supplies. She took care of her boat because her life depended on it.
Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small and beautiful, but also fragile. She had a big change in her life when she went to South Georgia, a lonely island in the south Atlantic. There, she helped with a study of albatross birds. This made her think differently about the world. She saw many old whaling stations and felt it was a warning. She thought we take what we want and then leave.
When I visited Ellen’s office, she was finishing a call. She told me we need to act now to save the planet. She said we are running out of coal, oil, and gas. We need to find ways to not use everything up. At first, she said we should use less, but then she found a better way to think about it. Now, she talks about re-using things, like special carpet tiles.
For three years, she has been visiting factories and talking to people about our use of resources. She said, “I will never be an expert, but I love learning.” She felt she could not ignore the problems we face. Sailing felt selfish compared to this work. She started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a better future.
Ellen misses the adventure of being at sea. She said, “It is part of who I am. You feel connected to everything. You focus on survival.” She knows her new message is not as simple as being the fastest sailor. She may have been fast, but this work is the most important thing she has ever done."

Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. Jordan hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and climb their own mountains. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Few people do this before they are thirty years old. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he turns 14.
Some famous climbers think it is not a good idea to take a 13-year-old up Mount Everest. They believe that while Jordan may be strong, he might not be emotionally ready. They also think he may not have enough experience to climb safely. Paul, Jordan's father, knows about these concerns. He says, ""I know people criticize us, but we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence.""
Paul also wants to make sure Jordan really wants to do this. He says, ""This project is not about me becoming famous. At first, Jordan wanted to do this later, but we thought, 'Why not now?' We talk to him often to see if he still wants to climb."" When asked why he wants to climb, Jordan says, ""I just focus on my goal.""
In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest climber. Now, every adventure is shared online, and people want to break records. This makes it hard for Jordan. Some people think that trying to achieve records takes away the fun. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his journey online. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest.

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they look confused. I just started studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t have any of their recordings. This is sad for people who love classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music, and most classical recordings sell only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe.
Why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for a long time? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not attract many people, especially teenagers, who buy most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I don’t really like classical music. I enjoy many types of music, but I listen to classical music very little.
So, why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, classical music has many changes in mood, and we like fast music. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs more time and focus. Also, pop music talks about things that matter to teenagers, while classical music often does not.
The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely hear classical music in our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I don’t think many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. 
Some people think schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy playing classical music, but it is not their favorite music to listen to. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music. 
**Questions:**
1. What type of music do most teenagers listen to?
2. How many concert tickets sold last year were for classical music?

42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side of the car, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hill; it looked confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gym, riding centre… “Riding centre,” said Bonnie, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” said her mother. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of behind me,” said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do it. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she said to herself. “I’ll be sent away soon anyway,” she thought, “so why not go now?” She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She walked carefully to the horses, treating them with respect. The horses were well cared for, and she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, touching its nose. Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best!” she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride the horse. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. The room with the riding gear was unlocked. Excited, she put a saddle on Maverick’s back and forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her old school friends called her Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said happily. “I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and a little breeze made her cheek feel warm. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."

I met Cody Simpson before, and I was impressed by his quiet confidence. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia. He has already released many successful songs. How did a relaxed surfer end up on stage in front of many fans? 
Cody says, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven."" He remembers that he was swimming and surfing every day. These activities were very important to him. When he was 13, he was in high school and posted some videos online. 
These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans wanted to see more videos on social media. Cody recorded more videos at home, and the responses were amazing. 
Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches. But then, record labels contacted him, and he had to make a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming or take a risk by moving to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the chance. 
He said, ""It was very difficult for me to choose a career at such a young age. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 years old and trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. Most people were surprised because he is a quiet kid. 
Cody packed his bags and moved with his family to another part of the world. He gave up one dream to try to make another dream come true. His family stays out of the spotlight but supports him. Cody believes it is important to have good people around you to stay grounded. 
Sometimes, he thinks about how his decision affects his little brother and sister. His brother is eight years old and travels the world with him. Cody worries about how this affects his brother, but his family always supports him. 
Cody says that success comes from being ready to say ""yes"" to big opportunities, even if it is scary. He adds, ""Everything happened so fast and unexpectedly. Now, I go to countries I never thought I would visit and play in front of many fans. It is something many people dream of, but I know it won’t last forever."""

I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I squinted and looked upstream at the sandbags. They were there to stop the buildings from flooding when the ice melted. My back still hurt from moving the sandbags. Last week, I worked with many adults in the town for long hours to help. My grandfather did not notice much. 
I looked at the dark water from the factory in Milltown. There was thin ice on both sides of the water. I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit. I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. He was trying to balance on the ice near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and put on my kayaking jacket. I checked my pocket for my lucky chain. It is a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Only my grandfather, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. 
I touched the chain and went to the kitchen. “Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You are up early for a Saturday. I will make brunch after your training. Be careful.” “Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. “Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” “Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was clear because I was wearing my wetsuit. Grandpa always gets angry, but I try to ignore it. “What is the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went to the bathroom and slammed the door. My mom came to me with a kind smile. “Don’t worry about him. He’s…” “...not himself right now,” I said. I wanted to say he always acts this way, but I kept quiet. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old pictures still hang on his wall, with his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, I want to stay close to him, even if he is grumpy. 
My mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your hard work, even on these cold days!” I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. I stepped into the backyard and hurried to the boathouse."

Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, there was a painting that was not in a frame. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s paintings, but it looked different and was not finished. 
“Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” Jess looked at the painting. There was a river in it, but it was not a river she knew. It looked like a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a spooky way. The riverbank was very small, with a little green that was hard to see. The eye was drawn to the pale water and a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after a long summer.
Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others think about them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. “River Boy.” The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 
Then Jess looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” 
“Exactly. It’s strange, isn’t it? For him to be so specific. But he hasn’t finished it yet, so maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” 
“Mum! You should have known better.” 
“I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.” 
Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would say. “He told you it’s not up to the artist to explain a painting because each painting has its own life and language, just like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. And he said painting is hard work without having to explain it to everyone.” 
Mum laughed. “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.” 
“Inspire?” 
“Someone who helps an artist.” Jess knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually said the muse was not helping him or that he had to be nice to the muse. He never said the muse was about her. She thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to think that anyone could inspire someone as stubborn as Grandpa. 
“He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He has been painting all his life.”"

This morning, I woke up and did not mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. It might have been an accident. Maybe I tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand, and the knife could have gone into the carpet. I did not want to damage the carpet. I did not wake up and think, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at that moment. Afterward, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. 
What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is very cute! It is small, painted white, and has pink and blue flowers on it. Gran used to keep china ornaments in there. I keep my shells and stones in it. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was very happy when she gave it to me! 
The cabinet is a corner cabinet, so it has to stand in a corner. My bedroom is the smallest room in the house. It is shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is for Mum and Dad, my sister Angela has the back room, and my brother Tom has the little room over the garage. I have the smallest room, which is like a broom cupboard. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have Tom’s room. But Angela is only fifteen, so I think I will be in my small room for a long time. 
I do not mind; I like my little bedroom. It is cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is, there are not many corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet in the space between the roof and the floor, but it was a little too tall. I thought, if I cannot cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. Dad always tells us to “think outside the box.” That is what I was trying to do!"

The book ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of tiny people. They live in the walls and floors of a house and take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show from the book, I knew it would be hard to make everyone happy. People who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book because I did not want people to say I did it wrong. The author wanted the show to show the Borrowers' view, not the humans' view, which made filming harder.
The most important thing was to show the right size. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans. So, when we filmed the Borrowers walking or going on their missions, we had to be ten times further away than usual. When we filmed the human world, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low, about 15 centimeters high. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for special shots. 
One big problem was making the shadows look right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We made a special way to do this. After the show, the famous director George Lucas called me to ask how I did it. The only set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, filled with big objects to make the actors look small. It was very strange. I remember the coins we used; they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much.
In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was very scary. I wanted to get the costumes right, which was hard for other directors. I had the costumes made from heavy material so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to move. She could not sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they liked the costumes!
Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to act with things that were not really there. I drew pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I drew 2,000 pictures! They were not perfect, but they worked. We did not have enough money for special effects during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly. One time, I filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the show was successful in showing the magic of the books.

Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, thinking there might be journalists, but there aren’t any. I know that soon there will be people acting crazy. It always happens. The fake smiles, the new friends who want something from me. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone at this new school. But I wanted this. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet normal kids. Kids with parents who have regular jobs, like working in an office or cutting grass. That would be so cool.
I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking serious. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I say again. The secretary looks confused. “Oh,” she says and types my last name. That’s good because not many people know my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she says. Then she gives me my schedule. English Literature is my first class. Great! I like English. But I will be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look lost. 
When I get to the door, I hear the teacher calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the back of the class. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher stops calling names. “Desert... McGraw?” she says. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After that, she lets us talk to each other! 
“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few answers. I could say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters. Or I could say what my dad thinks: “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album.” He thinks it has energy and culture. I think he just wants to relax at the beach. “My dad had to move here,” I tell her. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out soon, but I want to pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” She seems not to care much. That’s good."

Today, many American teenage girls are expected to do a lot. They should be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in school. Being a teenager in America is not easy. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average. They need to work hard and show ambition. 
Kristen Loose, a teenager, says, “People forget how much pressure we have. We have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and we also want to have a social life.” Even with all this stress, people still think teenagers are lazy, loud, and selfish. Kristen believes this is not fair. 
She says many people think teenagers only watch TV or use their phones all the time. While she does have her phone close to her, she uses it for important things, not just for fun. Teenagers use their phones to help with schoolwork and stay connected. Now, students can do homework anywhere, not just at school. 
Many teenagers wake up early, around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., and go to bed late, often after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teenagers get enough sleep, which is nine hours a night. 
Lindamarie Olsen, another teenager, says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, this is not much. She does not spend her free time on social media or TV. Instead, she likes to volunteer. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves, but I love helping others.” 
In the future, teenagers will still be working hard and changing the world, just like they do today.

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a small mountain town in the US. This town is surrounded by wild nature, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, this group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long science project that is also an adventure, which is why many teenagers join.
One weekend in late spring, I joined them. They were going to release a high-altitude balloon to try to see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and makes a bright light. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer to check the temperature as the balloon went up. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to find it later. They used a gas tank, given by a friend from another state, to fill the balloon with gas. The balloon grew to the size of a small car. An older boy drove for seven hours to get the gas tank. He said, “I didn’t really mind.” For kids in this club, this is normal.
Finally, it was time for the balloon to go up. They counted down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon started to rise. Some of the kids ran and used flashlights to follow the balloon in the dark sky. There was a quiet feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky. It was hard to believe they were only four hours from Los Angeles, a big city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. One girl said quietly, “We’re the only ones talking.” Another girl whispered, “I know.” Suddenly, a meteor flew across the sky.
As the balloon rose, the air pressure changed, and the balloon got bigger until it popped with a loud noise. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. The group’s leader said, “Recoveries are a big part of the program.” They have only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. He added, “This journey helps us know the land better.”
This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the mountain. They had to decide if they should drive or walk. It could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high mountain or in a tall tree. The leader said, “These students know the Eastern Sierra well. What seems wild to some is normal for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not catch any shooting stars. This was a little disappointing, but it gave them a chance to talk about science and how things work in the atmosphere. It was also another adventure story to share with others."

Chloe Morgan says that she did not like science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen years old. It happened by chance. Her younger brother was very interested in dinosaurs, which she did not care about at first. One day, she helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. This surprised her, and she decided she wanted to study it.
Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius. He was young and already famous. At first, she was very nervous because she thought he might think she was just a silly kid asking too many questions. But he was friendly and listened to her, which made her feel better.
Chloe thinks that movies and TV shows often show palaeontologists in a wrong way. She says that films like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs, but they do not show what palaeontologists really do. She feels that they are often shown as strange geniuses or awkward people who cannot talk to others. 
In her job, Chloe does many things. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs to study fossils, and writes for science publications. Sometimes, she talks to the public about science, especially to young people. She believes it is important to help them understand science better. Talking about dinosaurs can make children excited about nature and science.
Chloe worked on a TV documentary called Walking with Dinosaurs. She helped make sure the dinosaurs were shown correctly. She did not have to change much because the show was accurate. The dinosaurs in this program are very different from those in movies like Jurassic Park. They look more real.
Chloe thinks dinosaurs are still interesting to people because they make us curious. They remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. Palaeontology is like traveling back in time."

When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not “there yet.” You keep asking, “Are we there yet?” But when you arrive, it is not “there” anymore; it is “here.” If you think you are “there,” you should ask, “Are we here yet?” 
Parents hear this question many times on long car trips. Kids might think it is hard, but it is nice to sit in the back seat. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the beautiful views outside. 
In the front seat, there is a parent who gives juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio, and keeps everything running smoothly. 
But sometimes, things can get crazy. For example, my younger brother, Tim, might put his foot on my side of the seat. I do not like that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and our parents have to separate us while driving. They tell Tim to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. 
After a while, I try to read, but I feel something on my arm. The window is closed, so I wonder where it is coming from. Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. This makes me angry. 
Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he sometimes says, “Yes, we are here. Get out of the car.” But we are still driving fast on the highway. Then he says, “Maybe we are not there yet.” This makes us quiet for a while. 
You know you are finally “there” when the adults get out of the car and go far away from the kids. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is: no, you are not there yet.

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can enjoy coffee and cake, and also play board games. John and Zuzi want people to have fun and come back again. Zuzi says they started this business because there is a lot of technology today. Many people are busy with their phones and gadgets. They wanted to help people spend time together and talk to each other.
The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games have simple themes, like farming and building. The first Eurogame was called The Settlers of Catan, made by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. Everyone stays involved and has fun until the end of the game.
There are also ‘co-operative’ games where all players work together to win or lose as a team. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, created by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Matt was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He remembers playing it with friends and feeling scared but also happy at the end, no matter who won.
Matt loved board games as a child, but sometimes he felt disappointed when the games were not fun. With help from his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular and had a lot of storytelling. It is like a video game because players develop characters and the story changes as they play.
The video game industry has helped board games become more popular. Many people now play games on their phones. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone plays games on their smartphones. More people are open to playing games than ever before.
At first, video games allowed people to play together in the same room. But then, many video games moved online, and players were not together anymore. Some people who liked video games wanted to play games with others in person again. In John and Zuzi's busy café, board games have become more than just fun. In our online world, games are now something to share with others in real life, and this trend will continue.

Jamie Scott is a musician from the UK. He has written and produced many popular songs. His story shows that hard work and not giving up are very important in music, even if you start slowly. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him learn to play the guitar. He only listened to a local radio station at home, which played music for older people. Because of this, he did not hear modern songs until he was 12 years old.
When he was young, Jamie had to choose between playing tennis and making music. He played tennis at a high level, but he liked music more. He spent his lunch breaks in the music room at school, learning songs on the piano. At 17, he left school to become a performer. He worked with a friend who played guitar but did not want to be a performer. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to make music. His dad said he had 18 months to succeed, or he would need to find a job.
At 19, Jamie got a deal with a music publisher after writing one song. However, the record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to stop working with his friend. He found success as a songwriter instead of a performer. After some hard times with a record label in the UK, he changed to another label to release a new album, but he did not become famous right away.
Jamie believes he has been in the wrong place at the wrong time as a performer, but he has been successful as a writer. He helps new artists and wants to write songs that many people will love. He tells artists that it is okay to want their music to be popular. He wants to write great songs that can be number one hits. Jamie is honest about his goals and works hard to create the best music. He wants to write songs that will be loved for a long time."

Tony Connor is a new type of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, do not know him because we do not watch videos of people doing tricks on bikes. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other strange places. People film these jumps and put them online.
I met Tony in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys know him well, and some older people come to say he is ""an absolute legend."" After watching him, I agree. At first, I was not sure about him, but I was impressed by his courage and creativity. Before each jump, he explains what he wants to do, and sometimes I think he cannot do it. But when I tell him he did a great job, he seems not very happy.
Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans. He prefers to do things instead of just talking about them. This is funny because his fame comes from social media and cameras that help make videos. He says, ""This technology helps people like me earn money."" Sometimes he feels like everyone is filming themselves or looking at screens, and he does not like that.
Tony makes good money from his videos, which is different from people in the past who did similar things as a hobby. After many years of talking to top athletes, I think two things help a child become a great athlete: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are often more important than talent. In risky sports, it is very important to be strong mentally.
Even in the park, Tony fell a few times when trying new things. But he got up and kept trying until he could do it. Some people do not see him as a hero. They think he takes too many risks. He says, ""People who say this may care, but they do not understand. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and do not know the sport. They do not see that I get advice from experts to stay safe.""
Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He says, ""People are different. Some are not scared, and they should not do these sports. It is smart to know the dangers. Some people cannot get over their fear, but I can. I feel scared but find a way to keep going. I am not addicted to risk. I spend a lot of time planning and getting ready. Sometimes I ride around to feel ready before trying a new jump. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus completely, I will be fine.""

56,B1,"'Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 metres above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net. She only had a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her keep her balance, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 
Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. She already had some circus skills, but she found out that high-wire walking was very different. ‘The training was a shock,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know I needed to be so strong. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then I did an hour of exercises, and another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’
On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-metre walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said after. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ But this experience did not stop Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"

He wanted to build a special one. “The craziest bike I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to learn how they were made.” After two tries in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally started his trip in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. “I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, but I never regretted my penny farthing. The further I went from home, the more people were amazed by it.” His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in a hostel bed without medicine for ten days. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. But now, Jeff says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”'"
58,B1,"""I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning about water birds, especially the American black duck. We have a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’. This tool helps us see the ducks at night! We are worried about black ducks because their numbers are very low. We don’t know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we don’t know what they do at night. The night-vision scope will help us see clearly, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and take better care of their home.
Our work is hard. There are four of us, and we work six hours every day. We have studied ducks in different places. Sometimes, I have to take a boat to see the ducks and write down what I see. The weather can be difficult. Some nights are warm, but many nights are wet. It is very quiet, and I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. I like this challenge, especially when I think about summer. In summer, we will work in a laboratory and look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important. I wouldn’t change this job for anything!"""
59,B1,"""When I tell people what my job is, they often don’t believe me. But I am not joking! I work with chocolate! Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure customers get good chocolate from my company. Every week, I get small samples from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the nuts and fruit we use in the chocolate. I spend time choosing the best ones to use. 
Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the chocolate I make. I also share samples with my colleagues! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients. It is great to have my own space during the day. 
No two days are the same in my job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel to buy raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety in my job, even more than the chocolate! 
People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, and I still love to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"""
60,B1,"'Have you ever thought about what it is like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills. Students learn to juggle, throw, and catch things like balls or even fire. They also learn trapeze, which is flying in the air above an audience. 
The course lasts one year. Students take more risks as they learn, and parents can come to some classes to see how they are doing. Sophia says, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to do different things. It is important to keep performances exciting. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is very important too. Circus artists train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always want to improve their skills. 
Some people think circus performers get hurt a lot or only work for a short time each year. But the real challenge is thinking about the future. You can only travel and perform when you are young, and then you need to think about other jobs.” The course also teaches business planning. Many past students start their own businesses around the world and share their experiences. Sophia warns that this job is not for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not have a regular salary. It is also competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”'"
61,B1,"'You may not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a backing singer. This means she sings in the background to help the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not good enough to be main singers. This is not true – they often have to be better. People like Mariam are very important in the music industry! 
Mariam says, “What I love about my job is that when I go to the recording studio, I never know what I will sing. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it is a funny song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what the producers ask me to do. One time, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do my job!”
Mariam explains that good musical skills are very important for her work, and she must learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. She remembers her first time recording background music for a film. It was very hard because there were eight of them, each singing a different part, and there was also an orchestra. She was scared because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long.
One of her favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers do not always know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to her sing their song, they can learn how to make it better.'"
62,B1,"'Julie Deane started with little knowledge about fashion, but she created a successful business with her satchels. A satchel is a traditional bag used by schoolchildren. Now, these bags are sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before she chose to make satchels, Julie thought about different businesses, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to make the right choice. Some people told her there was no need for satchels, but Julie believed in her idea. 
Julie worked with her family, especially her mother, who had never worked before but was good at business. The design of the satchels came from children’s storybooks. Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her succeed. At first, she sold only one satchel a week. To get more attention, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them. They did, and more people became interested. Now, her company makes satchels faster.
Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity uses her satchel! While other companies spend money on online ads, she asks the online community for ideas to create new styles. There was a difficult time when another company copied her design, so now she makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors say her office has a positive feeling, and people enjoy working there. There is a new factory, and while buildings are important, it is the team that makes it special.'"

When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to do many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could be a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork.
When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special racing bike and started to compete. Vicky thought this was exciting and wanted to try it too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was near her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.
Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped competing. Vicky said, “I loved winning, but I got tired of it. When the excitement goes away, there is no point.” Luckily, she found a new job.
Vicky works for a charity called CycleZone. “We help young people who do not enjoy sports,” she says. “First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves.” CycleZone helps young people come together and be part of a group.
The charity uses famous people to promote their work. Vicky says, “Some people think having a celebrity is not always good for a charity. They say celebrities do it for attention, and this can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"

Ana Ronson is a singer and songwriter from Ireland. Her parents did not play music, but there was always music in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert.
A year later, Ana's brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song called ""Falling Stars"" in just three days. She enjoyed writing so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. But Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about this feeling. She shared this song online, and many people loved it and left nice comments.
Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone to tell her what to sing. But Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. All the tickets sold out quickly, and it was a wonderful night.
Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times in life because she feels she has more to say then. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how sad it made him. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but she wants to write about her own important experiences."
65,B1,"""Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat on a guided tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write stories about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not share that interest. I had always wanted to visit this area because our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. I asked Harry many times if I could go with him, and he finally said yes!
A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather was good for the time we would be there. I was busy at work and did not have much time to plan, but Harry said he would take care of everything, so I felt better.
When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group, packed our things into small boats, and started our journey. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast now. On the first morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see. I enjoyed watching the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.
We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I did not know. I loved that I did not have to worry about time. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it felt nice to live without stress.
When it was time to go home, I felt sad. I did not want to return to normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"""
66,B1,"""My dad was a basketball player in Germany. His father was also a player. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of my dad's games. You might think I would love basketball, but I didn’t. I liked to tell my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often read a book instead of watching the games.
When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After a few weeks, I played against another school. My parents came to watch, which made me nervous, but it was OK in the end!
For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was great to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents. At home, I couldn’t spend much time with my friends because of training, so that was not a big change for me. I got used to my new life, and my English got better quickly!
I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I was taller than most players in the league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""
67,B1,"""Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism in college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city, and I was happy to see how much I enjoyed it. I saw my city in a new way every time! After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a tour guide full-time. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed to know a lot more to get a license. All tour guides in Chicago must answer many questions about the city, like its buildings, history, and public transport rules. After some hard but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide.
Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be entertaining and tell good stories. It is important to handle changes, like if a place is closed when you arrive. Tourists want to enjoy their tour, not hear about problems. I want my visitors to be happy, or they might leave a bad review online. Good reviews are very important because they help me get more customers. I try to make my tours fun and easy. Because I love my job, I usually get good reviews, and many visitors recommend my tours to others in Chicago."""
68,B1,"""My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have things in common with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this kind of work. In the end, we had nothing to worry about. 
One of our main jobs was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants!
The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants into the forest where they slept at night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we did not have much space. We chose to do this because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff talked and played games.
Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little upset with herself because she missed her friends too much. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"""
69,B1,"""My name is Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different customers. Hotels and offices often buy flowers for their reception areas. Sometimes, we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising pictures. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.
My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. It can be hard to choose flowers because there are so many beautiful ones. My favorite color is pink, so I would choose pink flowers for myself. But I have to remember that other people may want different flowers. Not all flowers are available all year, so I sometimes cannot find what customers want.
I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but I have to do it. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then, we make flower bunches and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they want. Some people may think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. I wouldn’t want any other job!"""
70,B1,"""My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films. It also has many films for kids on weekends. The cinema is close to my home, but a year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about films with other people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends! 
We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made it a great place for the film! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money.
Each time we show a film, it gets easier for us, especially now that we have our own equipment. We can see how many tickets we sell online, so we don’t worry about empty seats. There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great time, it makes us happy. 
Our website helps us a lot, and we are in touch with other film clubs in the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but we always like coming back to our own club! We also started a blog because many people look online for film information instead of reading local papers. We put up some posters in cafés, but the best way to get new people is when others tell their friends about us. The audience loves the fun activities we have with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""
71,B1,"""When I was a child, I loved taking photographs. When I turned 15, I wanted to make my hobby better. I decided to take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone suggested that I should focus on one topic for my photos. I agreed and started taking more photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing. They were taking color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I believed in myself and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget when the judges told me I won first prize. I was so happy because my project was very important to me. It was the first time I realized my photography was good, and I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I am happy with my career choice."""
72,B1,"""I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try camping and sailing and learn new skills like public speaking. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn something new. There are levels from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ help us. When you finish each level, you get a certificate.
When I first joined, my leader said I should help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure about this because I had joined that club when I was eight, and I found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate.
Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.
Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I want to go to college after school to become a youth worker, someone who works with children. I never thought about my future job before joining the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one of them is for camping!"""
73,B1,"""I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a place in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try it. I was too young to ask him if I could snowboard, but he loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. After that, I loved snowboarding and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people do many competitions and get bored, but I still love to compete and win. This helps me work harder. I like not having a strict plan. Sometimes this works out well, like when I was the first girl to get a perfect score of 100 in a local competition. I was not sure I could do the jumps for this score until I tried. This made me trust myself more. 
In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. This helps me deal with not doing what I love. I think about my future. Snowboarding is very important to me, but I want to have another job too, just in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time to go to college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."""
74,B1,"""When I was fifteen, I wanted the same things as my friends. I did not think about the future. For example, I did not know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could only have one if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. 
I worked every Saturday in a café, but I did not enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I thought it would be hard, but it was easy. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. My mum showed me how to make pretty things at home with simple tools and materials. 
I sold my first jewellery to my friends and family. They said they liked it, but I was not sure if it was good enough for other people. I wanted to know, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home. Soon, people from all over the country called us to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at the market! 
That was when I knew my business could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun!"""
75,B1,"'When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s life. In an interview, Janine said, “Because my father’s job made us move a lot, I learned to make new friends. I know what it is like to be the new student in a class. This helped me write about Amelia, the main character, who starts at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially with her older brother. I am an only child, so I had to use my imagination to write about that.” 
Janine started her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother wanted to be a writer, and her teachers encouraged her to write too. So, writing was a good way for Janine to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story competition on a young writers’ website. That is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores. 
One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face some hard problems. This makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that even if Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many other famous authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people saw me in the street, but now it’s OK. I want to help other young writers, but they need to find their own way. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and then I will have something interesting to write about!”'"
76,B1,"""My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father got a job as the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy to get this job, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree. We were worried about living on the island. We thought the castle might not be as nice as our warm home across the water, and there was no school there. 
After we moved, we got used to life on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. In summer, the island is friendly and has many visitors. There are often parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there are not many teenagers. The adults help each other with work on the island, which can be hard.
The biggest change for me was taking a boat to my old school every day. I was excited to go on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is scary. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! 
We often see beautiful views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then it can be sunny again in a few hours. It is still amazing to see this, even after living here for a long time. We do have bad storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough. But I remember it has been here for many years, and it is still standing!"""
77,B1,"""I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I love nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They taught me how to tell different types of birds apart and where to find them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different types of birds. I am almost there because I have seen birds from other countries on family holidays. We always look for places with birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there, but it didn’t happen. I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I made a video about my birdwatching challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked fun. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous before I went on stage, but I remembered what to say and had notes to help me. The whole school and my friends were watching! I relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I did well. I might do another presentation next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not want to be birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter how old they are, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."""
78,B1,"""I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew I liked to try new hobbies but then stop them, so they thought I would stop playing football too. But I didn’t. I dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I thought. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a good player. He told the manager of a women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13 years old. I got much better after that. Still, some people were not sure I would be a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in an important match earlier than I thought! I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal! Even with many fans watching, I could hear my coach cheering for me. After the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and let them meet other players in my club. They will see what it is like to be in a professional team and feel they can play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach told me – there will be good times and bad times too. I have had very few bad times, so I feel lucky!"""

In the UK and other countries, there is a new idea in schools and universities. This idea is to help new students start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way for everyone to learn and build skills. Research skills are important for studying and for jobs because they help us think about the world and do our work better.
As a student, you can help create knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say; you ask questions. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are important for research. 
Research can be very complex, but it can also be simple. At the simple end, research is about asking questions and looking for answers. Most students have done some research before. You have probably asked questions for school projects or at work. You have also done research when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training your dog, or shopping online.
In college and university, you are expected to ask questions, think critically, and explore information. Some students find this hard because in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. They may think it is wrong to question what teachers or books say. However, in many places like the UK, US, and Europe, it is important to question knowledge and those who teach it.
Doing research can feel challenging. Critical thinking is very important. We should not just repeat what we read or hear. Instead, we need to think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. We should not just accept everything as true without questioning it."

Cities have always been important places for ideas and discussions. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafés. However, living in a city can be hard. The same cafés in London that helped people talk also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 
Today, cities are full of creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming. Scientists are studying how city life affects our brains, and they found some surprising results. City life can be tiring, and it can make it harder for us to think clearly. One reason for this is that cities lack nature. Research shows that hospital patients get better faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a little bit of nature can help our brains relax and work better.
More people now live in cities than in the countryside. Instead of having open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. This crowded life can affect our mental and physical health. When we walk in busy streets, our brains have to pay attention to many things, like other people and traffic. This can make us feel tired because our brains are always working hard to focus.
Natural places are easier for our brains. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature helps our brains recover. Nature has things that catch our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like sirens. When we are in nature, our brains can relax and recharge.
Before scientists studied this, philosophers and city planners warned about the problems of city life and wanted to add more nature to cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A good park can help our brains feel better quickly. Many people look for ways to improve their thinking, but walking in nature is one of the best ways.
Despite the problems of city life, cities keep growing. Research shows that crowded streets can also lead to new ideas and creativity. The many social interactions in cities help people be creative. Just like the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy areas of today’s cities can also help with innovation. 
The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. Sometimes, people feel tired of nature and want to go back to the city!

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced machines that can show us brain activity. However, I believe that studying the mind should not only focus on what is inside our heads. There is a lot of evidence from history that shows that objects and tools also help us think. For example, things like stone tools, jewelry, drawings, and writing have played an important role in how humans have developed their minds.
Many scientists study the mind by looking at people without the things they usually use. This is helpful for understanding the brain, but it can make us forget that we often think with the help of things around us. I do not want to say that the brain is not important, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It is useful to think about how human intelligence connects with culture and the things we use.
I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). This theory looks at how objects can help us think. For example, when someone makes numbers from clay or uses a stone to create a tool, these actions show how things can help our minds. MET also studies how this relationship has changed over time and what it means for our thinking.
Think about a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The blind person and the stick work together, showing that minds and things can be connected. The stick helps the blind person feel their surroundings, and the brain sees the stick as part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence can change and grow when we use new tools and technology.
I see the human mind as something that is always changing and developing. No matter what tools we have used throughout history, like stone tools or the internet, they help us understand the world and move forward. For humans, tools are not just for getting food; they help us learn and explore. This special ability to use objects to think is why humans create things more than any other species. I call this ability metaplasticity, which means our minds can change as we interact with the world around us.
MET helps us understand how different tools, from ancient hand-axes to modern smartphones, can change who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound like science fiction, humans have been using it since the beginning of our existence.

Photography is an important invention that has changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It is used in many ways, like science, industry, and art, and it also brings fun and entertainment. Historians say that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to visual arts. 
Photography became popular in the mid-19th century. People liked it because it used machines, which matched their interest in technology. Just like trains and electricity made travel easier, photography brought images of the world into homes quickly. The camera helped people show their identity and share images of themselves and their families. It created a record of family life, even if it was not always perfect. 
Photographs are realistic and connect with the art of showing everyday life. Each photograph tells us to look at something special. Because photographs are made by machines, they are seen as records of real events, people, and things. However, the person taking the photo also gives their own view, which can change how we understand the image. 
People often think they know what a photograph means, but it can be more complicated. The meaning of a photograph can change based on where and how we see it. To understand a photograph, we should think about why the photographer took it and how people first saw it. 
In recent years, artists have used photographs in their work in many ways. For example, artist Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings. Now, photography is seen as an important part of art, not just separate from painting."

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition helps us understand psychology today. Everyone has a mental life, which means we have thoughts and feelings. We can study these in humans, rats, and monkeys, but it can be hard to understand.
William James was interested in human psychology. He believed it has basic parts: thoughts, feelings, and the physical world around us. Our knowledge about these things is personal and comes from our own experiences. Sometimes, we think we know why people act in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy. But when two people understand things differently, it can cause problems.
Psychology tries to find the best explanations for different situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our personal thoughts and scientific facts. They study the mind and brain, but they do not know everything about how the brain works. They learn more by observing our behavior and making guesses about what happens inside us.
Studying psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. It requires careful observation and logical thinking. Psychologists want to describe, understand, predict, and change behaviors. When they achieve these goals, they can help us understand our experiences and improve our lives.
Psychological research has helped in many areas, like teaching children to read better, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings when they are sad. Although people have talked about psychology for a long time, it has only been studied scientifically for about 150 years. Early psychologists looked at their own thoughts to find answers, but this method has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to observe the behavior of others to develop their theories."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. Some examples are A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, believes that each product has a sad story about the people who tried to sell it.
The museum is surprising because it makes money. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products. They do not want to think about their failures. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing worker, wanted to collect new products, not just the failed ones. He began buying every new item he could find in the 1960s. He did not realize that most products fail. Because of this, he ended up with many failed products in his collection.
Today, many people are very positive and think good things will happen. This can lead to products being made that are not successful. People often have meetings where they do not see that a product will fail. Sometimes, marketers spend more money on a bad product to try to make it sell better. They do not want to talk about what went wrong.
In the self-help world, there is a popular idea called ""positive visualization."" This means if you think about good things happening, they are more likely to happen. Some scientists, like Tali Sharot, believe that our brains are made to see things positively. However, thinking too much about good outcomes can actually make people less motivated to reach their goals. 
Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that when people spend time imagining how well things will go, they often do worse in real life. Carol Dweck, another psychologist, says that how we see failure depends on our beliefs about ability. Some people think ability is something you are born with, while others believe it can grow with effort. People who think ability is fixed feel very bad about failing. For example, a sports star who thinks he is a natural talent may not practice enough and then fail. On the other hand, people who believe ability can grow see failure as a chance to learn and improve. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles get stronger by being pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success.

Everyone knows that sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and we are starting to question what we thought was true. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand how players can play their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage is important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel good playing anywhere?
What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games far away, like in Asia, to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans who believe their team needs their support and energy. Fans often think that if they cheer loudly, their team will score. They remember the times when they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the times when their cheering did not help.
There is one idea that seems to be true based on science. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also shout at the referee. In a study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another game in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This means referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home fans.
Recent studies show that home advantage has become less important in many sports, but not as much as we might think. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England won about 70% of the points, but now they win about 60%. One reason for this change is travel. In the past, traveling was hard, but now players travel in comfort. Also, stadiums look more similar now, which may affect home advantage.
Different sports have different levels of home advantage. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball is about teamwork. In basketball, players feel more confident when they play at home, which helps them play better.
Another interesting point is that players have higher testosterone levels before home games. This might be because they want to protect their home ground. In some recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams won at home against stronger teams, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there.""
**Questions:**
1. Why do sports teams often do better at home?
2. What do sports scientists want to understand?
3. How did referees react to crowd noise during the study?

""The more I practice, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important for many athletes and their coaches. It is easy to understand why. First, many people argue about who really said it first. Second, the meaning is not clear. Player did not mean ""lucky"" in a real way; he was being funny. His real message was: ""The more I practice, the better I get."" 
This idea connects to a big question: Is talent something you are born with, or can you learn it? Many people believe that practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for saying that you need 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in anything. Many books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers,"" support this idea. They say that practice is what really matters.
However, author Epstein argues that this is not always true. He points out a problem with many studies about successful people: they often only look at the best athletes. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have special skills while others do not. Epstein travels around the world to find answers, from Kenya to Sweden and beyond. 
In Alaska, he learns that the best sled dogs might win because of their strong desire to run. This shows that both genes and choices can be important. Some people think that determination is a choice, but Epstein wonders if it can also come from our genes. 
He talks about the difference between ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture). He believes that both are important for top athletes. For example, if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in the world. 
Epstein also discusses race and gender in sports. He asks, ""If only practice matters, why do we have separate competitions for men and women?"" Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest ones."

A new report says that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today are not happy. In her book, Kith, she explains that many children stay inside too much. They spend a lot of time in front of screens, like TVs and computers, and they do not play outside in nature anymore. Griffiths believes this is a big problem.
A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. The children did not say they wanted more new technology. Many said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their childhoods fondly. They talk about how they played outside, explored, and had fun in nature. They think this was better than how children live today. However, they forget that they are the ones who keep their children safe and do not let them play outside as much.
Griffiths discusses how parents worry about dangers outside. This worry makes them keep their children at home. Because of this, toy and gadget companies sell more products to keep children entertained indoors. She also talks about how some children are given medicine for being restless or how they must wear goggles to play games. Some of these rules may not be very common, but Griffiths feels strongly about them.
While Griffiths has good ideas, she sometimes goes too far. She compares how we treat children today to racism, which seems extreme. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. She says children need to have small accidents to learn how to be safe later. However, she does not explain how to let children have these small accidents safely. 
Not all children want to play outside or take risks. Some children are shy or prefer to stay at home. Maybe the real problem is that we try to make all children act the same way, whether we keep them inside or push them outside.

I am a bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not just because of my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or answers we learn in school. They need good judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play.
My recent research is about how important play is for children’s growth. All young animals, including humans, play when they are young. Animals that need to learn more play more. For example, meat-eating animals play more than plant-eating animals because hunting is harder to learn than eating grass. Primates, like monkeys and apes, play more than other animals because they need to learn more.
Children play a lot because they have much to learn. Play is how both adults and young animals have always learned. The most important skills children need to live happy and good lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their feelings.
Creativity is very important for success. We do not need people who just follow orders or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can help people think ahead and find solutions, we will have a strong workforce. But this needs creative thinking. Creative people often have a playful mind.
Some adults, called geniuses, keep their childlike ability to play and think creatively. For example, Albert Einstein said that school almost made him lose his love for math and science, but he found it again after school. He called his creative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen.
We cannot teach creativity, but school can take it away by focusing on questions that have only one right answer. It is also very important to get along with others, care for them, and work together. Children naturally want to play with other children, and through play, they learn social skills and fairness, which they need for life.
Play is voluntary, which means players can stop whenever they want. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players know they must keep each other happy to keep playing. This makes play a very fair activity.
However, school has become harder. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Organized sports have taken the place of free play. “Play dates” with adults have replaced playing outside with friends, and adults often feel they must help instead of letting children solve their own problems.
These changes have happened slowly but are very big. They are caused by many social factors, like parents’ fears, warnings from experts, and the idea that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and the future, we must change this trend. We must let children play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for the future."

In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect directly with employers. This is easier than standing outside an office with a big sign that says ""hire me."" But using social media can also lead to mistakes.
For example, a young man in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. He thought she could help him find a job because she knew many important people. However, she was upset that he asked her to share her contacts. She rejected his request and sent a very rude message that many people saw online. People were shocked by her message, and she might regret how she wrote it. 
This situation shows that young people need to be careful when using social media for work. Many young people use sites like Facebook and Twitter for fun, but using them for jobs is different. When I was a teenager, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. You could change how you looked online with pictures and songs.
However, using social media for work is not the same. Some young people still act like they did when they were teenagers. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will impress employers on LinkedIn. We need to understand that what we learned as teenagers does not work anymore. We must meet employers' expectations to get jobs.
One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual and seem arrogant. This makes older people think badly of our generation. In reality, many young people are worried about finding jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills to do well at work.
So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, clearly say who you are and explain how you can help them. This way, you have a better chance of getting a good response. Avoid sending the same message to many people, and keep your tone polite. Remember, social media can help you make important connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid problems.

It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people reading UK national newspapers has dropped a lot, by about one-third to one-half. In the USA, a study shows that only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, down from 45% in 2001. Some people believe that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. 
However, history shows that old types of media often survive. For example, in 1835, a journalist said that books and theatre would not be popular anymore, but theatre is still here today. Radio is still popular even with television, and cinema is still around despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are coming back, with online sales increasing a lot since 2008. 
Newspapers were once a new form of media too. It took a long time for them to become the main source of news. This happened because it became easier to share news with many people thanks to new technology in the 19th century, like the steam press and the telegraph. People started to think that they needed to know what was happening around them regularly. In the past, people only noticed changes in the seasons or big disasters like floods or diseases. 
Before the 19th century, journalism was not a job that many people could do for a living. There was no need for news every day or week. Sometimes, having newspapers published regularly can be a problem. Now, people can read news online whenever they want. They can choose what news is important to them. When big news happens, online news can update quickly. Mistakes can be fixed right away, and there are no limits on how much information can be shared. 
But many news providers focus on being the first to share news instead of helping people understand it. In the past, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth and rumors mixed together. Today, it seems like we are going back to that way of sharing news. Newspapers have not always done a good job of explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand better in this confusing world.

If humans really felt at home under the moon and stars, we would walk happily in the dark. The night would be as clear to us as it is to many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures. Our eyes are made to see in the sunlight. This is a part of our nature, even if we don’t think about it. 
We have changed the night by adding a lot of light. This is similar to building a dam in a river. While there are benefits to this, it also causes problems called light pollution. Light pollution happens because of bad lighting design. This means that artificial light shines up into the sky instead of down where it is needed. Poor lighting makes the night bright, changing the natural light that many living things, including us, are used to. 
When artificial light spreads into nature, it affects many things like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ did not exist. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night in 1800. At that time, nearly a million people lived there, using candles and lanterns. There were only a few gas lights, and no public lights in the streets for another seven years. From far away, you would smell London before you saw its dim light.
We have brightened the night as if it were empty, but that is not true. There are many animals that are active at night. Light is very strong and can attract many animals. Scientists say that some birds are drawn to bright lights, circling around them until they fall. Birds that migrate at night can crash into tall buildings that are brightly lit. Young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange times because of artificial light.
At first, people thought light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the stars clearly. Most of us do not need to see the night sky for our work, but we still need darkness. We cannot ignore darkness. It is just as important for our health as light is. Changing our natural sleep and wake cycles can cause health problems. The way we wake and sleep is connected to the light and dark cycles on Earth. 
These cycles are very important to us. Changing them is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own bright lights, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural history – the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the beauty of a dark night with the Milky Way above us.

A leader of a big company said that his business will not keep track of how much paid holiday time employees take. He got this idea from a smaller internet company that has a similar rule. The leader said he was inspired by a happy email from his daughter. In the email, she wrote like a professional writer.
Some people think this new rule is not practical. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service. The big company has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where workers know each other well. In a big company, it can be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business.
The leader said employees can take as much leave as they want, but they must be sure their work is done and their team is ready. But is it really possible to be sure? When you come back from a holiday, there is always more work waiting for you. This can make employees feel guilty about taking time off. Feeling guilty can lead to stress, and if workers do not take enough leave, they may not work well in the long run.
There can also be pressure from coworkers about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, workers feel they must stay late, and this can create a culture where people do not take holidays. If workers feel they cannot take their leave, they may worry about looking lazy. This can make them feel stuck and not able to take the time off they need.
Technology makes it hard to separate work time from free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance work and time off. But if there are no set working hours, employees may feel they are always being watched by their boss. This can make them feel stressed.
Employment laws exist to protect workers. They have the right to a certain amount of paid holiday because rest is important for their health. Good feelings, creativity, and productivity can happen without workers being well-rested. So, I am not sure if the idea of ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is really what this policy is about or if it will work well.

Peer review is a process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is important because it helps to make sure that only good quality papers are published. However, reviewing a paper can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Some people wonder if this delay is worth it.
Many scientists still believe in peer review, but there are changes happening in how research is published. One change is the use of preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they are reviewed. This allows other scientists to read and discuss the new research quickly. 
Publishing in journals has become very competitive. Scientists want to publish in well-known journals to help their careers. This competition can sometimes lead to problems, like scientists leaving out important information to make their papers look better. Reviewers also face pressure to decide if a paper is good enough for a journal, rather than if it is good science.
Some scientists, like Ron Vale, think that preprints can help solve these problems. Even though preprints have been around for twenty years, not all scientists use them. Some worry that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. Others fear that publishing without peer review could lead to bad science. However, preprints allow for open discussion and feedback from other scientists.
Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shares her experience with preprints. She wrote a paper that criticized another published paper. In the traditional peer review system, the original authors could block her paper. But with preprints, both sides could share their views openly. This way, readers can see all the arguments and decide for themselves.
Preprint archives allow scientists to discuss their work with others around the world. They can also share negative results, which are often ignored by journals that focus only on new discoveries. Papers shared as preprints are read and cited more often, showing that this method works well. By using the internet to share research openly, preprints can help scientists focus on the quality of their work, not just where it is published.

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say, ""a painting in words."" But this answer does not make me happy, and it does not make them happy either. One day, I asked my students to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph was to describe the object like a scientist, and the other was to describe it from the object's point of view. They had to call it ""Poem."" One student wrote this: 
**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never use me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a special way. The exercise made us laugh and talk a lot. 
When I was in school, poetry was confusing for me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, many people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it is different from regular writing. It makes you want to read it, but often you feel let down because it is not interesting or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. 
What do we want from the poems we read? A poem should have deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts. We might cry while watching a movie, or read an article for information. Novels take us to different worlds, paintings are nice to look at, and music is very special. But poems can be useful in a different way: they can be unclear. Everyday life is often unclear, too. 
If you look up ""poem"" online, it says it is a type of art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is a fancy way to explain it, but the word ""poem"" comes from Greek and means ""a thing made."" A poet is someone who makes things. So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Some poets say poems are like wild animals – they cannot be controlled – or like machines – they are made carefully. But these ideas do not always work. 
The best part of trying to define a poem is the discussion it creates. Whether you think a poem is a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about both. It can help you see everyday things in a new way. 
A poem is not hard to understand, especially if you think about how song lyrics can stay in your mind. The mix of words and music is powerful, like the saying, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But sometimes, words can hurt. Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine. A poem can touch your heart like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper. 
What about the empty space around the poem? This space could be used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is written and rewritten like a story or article, but it is not made to be sold. Publishers send out poetry books, but they do not expect to make money from them. A poem is not just for selling; it is special on its own. Because of this, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money at that time. My wife, Marion, was very impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, I have found many things like brooches and coins, and they made me happy. I like feeling connected to the past. 
After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again. One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot where I knew there were old farming tools. When my detector beeped for the first time, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I had to check. I dug down half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I was careful not to get too excited. 
As I cleaned the dirt off, the ball turned into a beautiful, twisted loop. I remembered seeing something like this before at the British Museum. It was called a torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. It is made of gold and silver, with gold rings on each end. I took it to my car and looked at it while driving home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, which was probably the only cleaning it had since ancient times. 
“Marion!” I shouted, “I have something for you.” When she came into the room, she stopped and asked, “What is it?” I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I got up and hid it under a floorboard in my office. 
The law says I must tell the authorities about such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before I gave it away. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned around and stopped talking. The torc was checked and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. 
I received £350,000 from the sale, which I shared with the owner of the field. But the torc is more than just money for me. It is something I have saved for the country. People ask me, “Now that you found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I will keep searching for more treasures."

Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy trips with many activities, like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that I like to take long naps in the afternoon and enjoy lazy mornings in bed? Sleeping better is one of the nice things about traveling. 
When I went to Mexico’s Yucatán coast when I was in my early 20s, I was surprised that I slept more than 12 hours most days. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Far from home, with new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and have many dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, I could sleep easily. 
I think sleep is part of traveling, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences fill our minds. It makes sense that sleep feels different when we are traveling. 
People often worry about jet lag, but I think the problems I have after long trips are more about getting used to new places than just time changes. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, feel tired around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then feel active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their sleep patterns. When I finally do, I feel like I belong there. 
I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy and started to relax. One by one, my friends went to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows. I took some pillows too and followed their example. I had heard about the Latin American custom of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. 
Travel sleep is special because I remember it. In a new place, I enjoy the different smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If enjoying every moment of travel is what makes a good traveler today, then sleeping is one of the best ways to do that. Maybe I should not feel embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my friends that travel sleep is an important part of traveling too."

The woman looked at herself in the mirror. “What do you think? Please be honest.” Mia picked up a nice hat with a soft layer of fabric and a silk bow. “I think this one looks best on you,” she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a funny face. “But it is so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This pretty little hat will make me stand out.” She touched the small red and black top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said, “this is the one I want.” 
Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie. They did not know anything about Tattie. Mia’s husband, Jeff, had quickly asked, “What kind of name is that?” “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “It sounds strange,” Jeff said. He did not like anything that seemed too fancy. He also thought Mia was too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. 
An hour later, Mia closed her shop and went home. It took her only forty seconds to walk from work to her house. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to turn the empty barn next to their house into a space for her business. Jeff was not sure. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. Mia knew that many friends had trouble finding the right hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. In a friendly place, she let them try on many hats until they found the right one. She encouraged them to bring their outfits so they could match everything. Recently, she also started selling handbags and jewelry."

Lawrence Okoye has moved from London to Atlanta, and he is thinking about his amazing sports journey. He is confident but surprised by how far he has come. He went from being in the Olympic final for discus throwing to possibly playing American football. Lawrence has never played American football before, but he might be chosen for a big team in the USA.
In Atlanta, he is learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London could be picked for a big American sports team. But Lawrence likes to prove people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to train for discus throwing instead. After just 20 months of training, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.
Lawrence came to Atlanta to train for discus throwing, but he also thought about American football. He decided to try it when he arrived in the USA. He read about the NFL trials in Atlanta and applied to join, even though he had never played before. When asked if he was nervous about being tested with experienced players, he said he was not nervous at all. He believes in his abilities.
Lawrence did well in the tests and was chosen as one of the best players. He felt proud when he heard this. However, he knows he has no experience in football. He believes that if he works hard, he can succeed. He is not worried about whether he will be selected. Many people think he will be chosen, but he is not too concerned.
Lawrence has learned from his past experiences, including a disappointing Olympic final where he came last. He is happy that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. He knows that sports can be unpredictable. 
Playing in the NFL can earn him a lot of money, so he has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Some people think he should focus on just one sport. Lawrence understands this but wants to follow his dreams. If football does not work out, he can always return to discus throwing, which he loves. He believes every choice he has made is a good one."

I woke up on a plane flying east. It was daylight outside. I looked out the window and saw a big, empty land with dark brown and green colors. It was mid-September, but it was still summer in Siberia. I could not see any people. The view was beautiful with mountains, rivers, and forests. 
My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a slow Russian accent. His name was Sergei. He was a salesman from Moscow. He was going to sell safety clothes to miners. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. But I used a dictionary to tell him I was going to Magadan in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to ride my bicycle back to England. 
“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan. You cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked. “No, I will ride with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” he asked. “Yes, just one,” I said. Sergei looked worried and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to show him with my hands that I had warm clothes, but I didn’t tell him I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes were cheap. I was not sure if they would keep me warm, especially my big over-trousers that I bought for £10.
This all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of tired students. The teacher was talking, and I was thinking about a question. Should I ask my friend Al to go on a trip? I decided to write him a note: “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” I passed the note to Al, who was sitting in front of me. He read it, thought for a moment, and wrote back, “OK.” 
Now, six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. The job was sometimes hard, but it was also exciting and I had long holidays to go on adventures. I had visited Al twice during these holidays. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted to cycle around the world. He was taking on bigger challenges every time. This trip around the world was his biggest challenge yet. Sometimes he thought it was too hard, but I admired him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving to everyone that he could do it, and it made him feel alive."

In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 metres high. They make sharp turns and do loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to see what it feels like to fly in this race. 
An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets. Small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to keep looking at the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when I was upside down.
Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started to move down the runway, I was very nervous. I had to keep my legs up and not touch the important pedals and switches. I knew I should relax, but I could not. 
Dario, the pilot, and I were in a very fast acrobatic plane called the Zivko Edge 540. The plane took off, and we quickly turned to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon and tensed my body. For a moment, I felt much heavier than normal. Then we flew straight again. We turned left and went down fast, feeling my stomach drop. 
We were very close to the ground, flying between two pylons at 400 km per hour. I was excited but also scared. For two minutes, I got to fly the plane, but my hands were shaking. Dario asked me something, but I could not hear him. Instead, he did a barrel roll, turning the plane upside down. He asked if I was okay, and I said yes. He then did a loop, flying up and over in a circle. 
Many people would find this fun, like riding a rollercoaster. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was easier than what the pilots do in the race. When we landed, Dario ate sandwiches, but I could not eat for hours. That night, I dreamed about flying in loops over and over again. 
**Questions:**
1. How many pilots race in The Red Bull Air Race?
2. What do pilots have to do with their pockets before the flight?
3. What should you look at during the flight?
4. What is the name of the plane the pilot and the writer flew in?
5. How long did the flight last?"

Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, he probably filmed them. He likes it when it is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and a diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew find different places to film. After 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him because it included travel, adventure, and underwater work.
Now, he is a famous cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife shows. When he started 35 years ago, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. He became known as the ""cold man."" The technology for filming was very simple back then. He says it is easier to film today. In the past, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital cameras, you can see what you filmed right away. Before, you had to think about what shots you needed and what you missed. Film was very expensive, so you filmed less. Now, you can have too much footage.
Allan says his experience in cold places is very important. He feels comfortable on sea ice. He does get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places with no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. Wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not tell which birds they were.
Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. This place is home to polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, it is usually -32°C, and the wind is strong. Carrying cameras in deep snow is very hard. After walking for five hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, he only saw one mother bear and her cub. On the 24th day, he felt like he was part of the bear world. He had to move around to stay warm. After watching for five hours, he saw a quick glimpse of a bear. The camera was ready, and he focused on the viewfinder. After a few seconds, he saw a black nose, then a bear's head. The bear came out and rested in front of the hole. She looked at him but did not care. Just then, she slid down the slope, and two cubs appeared at the den entrance. It was their first view of the world, and it was very exciting.
Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects them. He believes he can make an amazing documentary."

In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies. He had to swim in very cold water, fight frostbite, and deal with polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new trip that is even bigger. Explorers like Pen are confident and strong. This time, Pen and two friends will go on a three-month journey of 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be very important for scientists. This work will show how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar areas.
Pen was prepared for this job since he was a child. His father’s old nanny, who worked for a famous polar explorer, helped him become strong. She sent him outside in bad weather with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in cold places, and Pen became very strong. 
Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses. She helps him with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he thinks about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event, and she finished an hour before him. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. 
Pen says it is harder to be away from his children this time. When he last went to the Arctic, his son was one year old and his daughter was five. He told his son to take care of his mother and sister, but this made his son very worried. Pen thinks it was not fair to say that. This time, he plans to have little contact with them while he is away because he does not want to remind them how far he is.
Before he leaves, Pen is getting ready and checking his equipment carefully. He says that when he is on the ice, it is hard to fix things. He will be with Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them with supplies.
Pen is also thinking about his age. He will be 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He is worried about what he will have to do. Pen believes that this trip is important for science. He says that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, scientists will use the information they collect. He wants to involve many people in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He feels that their skills are now very important and useful."
103,B2,"""I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Even though these activities were great, I wanted to compete again. I wanted to stay in shape to try for the Olympics if I felt that way again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben help me win? No. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. This made the race feel real. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would still take work. I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money after being a professional athlete. It feels good that people are interested. But I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I was doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was hard, but it was simple. I trained almost every day, but the program was set, and there were doctors and dieticians. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV. But my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing. It is also about the mind. Ben had done tough challenges, but he could not row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to tell Ben how much he needed to improve. I should have known what to expect when I agreed to race with him."""

A little over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. I was 26 years old and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, snowy places because I was tired of the busy life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They hired me as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is simple and does not have running water. They told me I could join their team for three months, but the work would be hard. I started packing right away.
**November 6, London**  
On my flight, I looked at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I was supposed to remember their names, but I felt nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window. I thought about how spring moves north, but I was seeing winter coming south, with rivers freezing.
**November 7, Helsinki and Hetta**  
The bus ride north was what I expected. We drove through dark forests with snow on the trees, stopping for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark. As soon as I got in, Anna gave me a pair of boots and sent me outside into the cold. She asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the sound of barking and found the dogs. Three people were busy getting the huskies ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited and wanted to run. I tried to introduce myself, but everyone was too busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone told me to get in the sled, and I almost fell in. Then we started moving into the dark with only a headlamp for light.
**November 15, Hetta**  
I quickly learned how to be a husky guide, but first, Anna asked me if I was useful. I didn’t know how to answer. I had never driven a snowmobile or used an axe. Finally, someone asked if I had a driving license, and I said yes. I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet to stop, and hold on to the handlebar. But other tasks were hard. Feeding and giving water to the dogs was difficult in the cold. Water would freeze quickly, so we made a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was tired and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw. In the snow."""

On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and crossed the finish line. Many reporters came to talk about her amazing run. They said her time was good enough to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. The journalists asked her about a special treatment called emu oil. This oil was recommended by Cathy Freeman, an Olympic gold medalist, to help Radcliffe heal from an accident when she ran into a bike while training.
Radcliffe said she did not really understand how big her achievement was at that moment. She thought it was just what she was supposed to do that day. She and her team decided not to set any limits on what they could do. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not be able to keep running so fast. Hartmann was angry about this, but he understood that people who did not know how fit she was might think it was risky.
With 800 meters left, Radcliffe thought she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part quickly. She had already run 41 kilometers very fast, but she still sprinted the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he never thought anyone would run that fast for a long time. Radcliffe thought, ""I will come back and do it again next year.""
After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who ran in a strange way, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann worked with Radcliffe for many weeks, helping her with her training. He said he had worked with many Olympic medalists, but Radcliffe could take a lot of pain. He had to work very hard on her muscles and sometimes felt pain in his hands after.
Hartmann traveled 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training place in France. When he arrived, her husband shouted, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for greetings or tea. Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour training session. She always pushed him to work harder, which is why she was so good.
Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes became upset. When asked why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe said, ""I trained very hard, but some people are more talented."" She thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, might break her record. Radcliffe believed that some runners focus more on racing against others than on improving themselves.
She explained that always pushing herself, even when she was winning, helped her run fast. Radcliffe did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the best she would ever run. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running.

1. What did Radcliffe do on that day?
2. Who recommended the emu oil to Radcliffe?
3. How did Radcliffe feel about her achievement after the race?

When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, came out, I was not sure how people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ in Britain, and I thought we made a good series that added something new. But I still worried: would people like a way of cooking that included not just techniques but also history and science? I watched the first show feeling both happy and scared. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my restaurant. 
In each project, I felt like I was on a journey, whether into the past or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one with its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often about traveling, with passports and suitcases. The latest book is called In Search of Total Perfection. In it, you will travel around the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent many years trying to reach their own idea of perfection.
Perfection is different for everyone. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard. I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. I could imagine people asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” But after a long meeting, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on their feelings and memories.
Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew I would not say the recipes were the best. I believed that by using my skills and talking to food producers, chefs, and customers, I could find out what makes these dishes good. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means improving through practice. Trying new ideas and changing them until you have something special.
The TV show let me explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me all over the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was using the wrong tomatoes and going to a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming. I even hand-milked a cow and used dry ice to make ice cream, cooked chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burned my house trying to make a real Neapolitan pizza."

We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the front of the van. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets. He looked like he knew what he was doing. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said after a while, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big and had only grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I said too, because it was better to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John walk away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound sure. “Liar,” Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I thought about asking Mum, but she was asleep in the sun. 
John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café. It was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said when it started to get dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I will have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. 
Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be pulled everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."

Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe. Lucy didn’t hear her name well because it was noisy. They were both older than Lucy by about ten years. They spoke good English and talked about the music they were playing and their travels. 
“I think I’m going to Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go. She didn’t want to do many things that took her away from school, like concerts and competitions. Because of this, she wasn’t officially enrolled in school anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 
Lucy didn’t even want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen pianists her age were chosen from many applicants, and she was one of them. There was a party, and her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate. Her little brother Gus dreamed about being at the festival one day. Lucy’s teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The funny thing was, Lucy hadn’t applied to the festival. Her mom filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be sad if you didn’t get in,” her mom said. Lucy thought her mom didn’t want to give her a chance to say no. 
The guy from Tokyo leaned forward and asked, “Tanglewood?” 
“Yeah.” 
“How old are you?” 
“Fifteen.” 
He looked at the girl, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to show off. It was hard to know when to share her achievements and when to be quiet. “It’s just part of this new youth program they are trying…” 
“Excuse me,” the girl said, looking away as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed. “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool. 
“Once, when I was about eight.” He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather came to her. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” 
“They're not the competition.” 
“Everyone is the competition.” 
Her grandfather took her around the room and made her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, understanding only part of what was said. 
In the elevator to their room after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” 
Lucy liked that. She liked being someone important, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn’t make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play difficult music. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."

“It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to go outside more,” said Dad. It is hard to argue with him, so I wanted to see what experts say about this. It is interesting. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have real friends, feel they belong, and are learning important skills for the digital world.
Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use social media differently than adults. They do not just check emails or buy things; they live in it. This is not good or bad – it depends on how you use it.
Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says that social media is like the youth clubs that parents went to when they were young. It helps teenagers share jokes and talk about their lives. It helps them find their identity away from their parents and deal with issues with their friends.
Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that being a teenager is a time to ask, “Who am I?” Social media can help with this. You can share your favorite music or sports and see how others think differently. Research shows that teenagers who use social media a lot are not more self-centered than those who do not.
Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social media. He believes it helps quiet people with special interests connect with others. If you are one of the few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a group online with similar interests, you can feel more connected and popular in a new way.
Pauline White, a digital education expert, says that teenagers can find new interests online and create their own content. She believes social media is a way for teenagers to be creative. They can make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers connect, learn, and share their work. This can help them get jobs in the future.
Every business uses social media to sell products and reach customers. If you have many friends on social media, they can be potential customers for your product. If you connect all your networks, you can reach more people.
Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they grow up and start working. Matthews agrees that many sites allow people to work together to create and share content. Working together is an important skill in today’s world and helps you get a job."

When people think of a family vacation, they might not think of a long trip across nine states in the US and one province in Canada. But my parents wanted to have a fun family trip this summer. My dad wanted to plan a trip for us to spend time together. He often said, “Not many people do this anymore,” while my twin brother and I looked at each other in surprise.
In mid-June, we packed our car with bags, food, and clothes for any weather. I was excited but also worried about not having my own space for two weeks. With little room left in the car, we started our “Family Great American Road Trip.” We left our big house for smaller places to stay for the next five thousand miles. I wondered what this trip would be like.
We drove west through Oklahoma. Even though we were close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right-of-way on the road!
The next day, we woke up early and continued our trip. We saw deserts and then mountains. Each day was different, but they all felt similar. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that town showed us what we would experience later.
As we drove up the mountains, we learned that some roads are better for special cars called Jeeps. We saw old and new things everywhere we went. We often had to wait in traffic because of construction. We laughed when we saw big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument.
We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park. There, we watched the sunset over areas where bears live. Sometimes, we had to stop for bears crossing the road, which was exciting and funny. 
As we continued our trip, I forgot about life at home. Even the old hotel we stayed in, which had no internet or cell phone service, could not stop our fun. The views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we started our journey back home. My parents were right; you don’t need to go far away to find something special. 
It was nice to be home together, and I was happy that I didn’t fight with my brother during our long trip. We took three thousand photos of our adventures, and I knew I would remember the unexpected and fun moments the most."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and living at the college. She had the best room with a kitchen and a study area. Amy was happy because she also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would check on Amy, even if she did not want them to.
Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a few happy times with Daisy and did not know her grandfather. Daisy wanted Rose to stay with her, even if Rose's parents were not happy about it. Rose did not know why her parents did not like her grandmother, but they had a fight in the past. Rose had not seen Daisy since she was ten years old. 
Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked to meet people. Rose thought she would get many dinner invitations and shopping trips. This made her smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she went to many social events. 
Before the move, Dahlia talked to Rose. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating and exercise. But Rose wanted to be independent. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She hoped Daisy would understand. 
Dahlia gave Rose a new mobile phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They all agreed to trust each other. Rose would act mature, and Daisy would not be too strict. If they had problems, they would talk about it.
Rose was not a wild child. She had good friends, and her school reports were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school. This was her fourth school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this would be her last school before finishing. For Rose, it was a new beginning in her life. 
**Questions:**
1. How old is Rose Frost?
2. Why is Rose moving to her grandmother's house?
3. What did Amy get for her room at the college?
4. How did Rose feel about living with her grandmother?
5. What did Dahlia give Rose before the move?"
112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger talks about how her primary school teacher thought she might write a book. She says, “I thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed hard. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like sports. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’” The book Charlotte started writing at that age is now going to be published. She told her old teacher about it, and her teacher was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40 years old. Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to do something she was good at.
It is a winter afternoon in the office of Charlotte’s publishers. I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, and I was surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a big achievement. It is exciting and well-written. The public relations person is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn’t. Charlotte is confident and smart, but she is also calm and not too proud.
Charlotte knows she is young. I ask her about the important questions in her book. She says, “I wanted to ask big questions, not give answers. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She laughs and adds, “I think my age doesn’t limit my understanding of the world, but I don’t think I am very wise. I just wanted to talk about taking responsibility.”
Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are shown in books. She thinks there are three types of teenagers in stories: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. She feels annoyed by these types. “What if you are just fine? There aren’t many stories about teenagers who are okay. Some writers make it seem like teenagers don’t know who they are because they lack experience. This can hurt their self-confidence.”
Charlotte loves reading books by famous fantasy writers, but they almost made her stop writing. “These books talk about deep things in life. I wondered if I had to write like that to make a good book.” However, she likes a book called How Not to Write a Novel. “It says if the reader can guess what will happen next, the story is not exciting anymore.”
Some people might think Charlotte’s parents, who are journalists, helped her get her book published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. Charlotte knows she is lucky because it is hard to get anyone to read a first novel. “Every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you have to do it on your own. In the end, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte says."

""‘Remember, speed is good, not bad,’ said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then a guy named David, who had some experience with ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew up into the air, but something looked wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said kindly, ‘speed can be tricky.’ 
I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On past ski trips, I liked to practice turns in the snow. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid to try because I didn’t know how, and I didn’t want to look silly. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and tried new tricks, landing in foam cubes – not a real way to learn for the slopes. 
After practicing inside, students went outside to try for real. ‘You will get better!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, new ski jumpers just went down the slopes and hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land in the wrong place, you will get hurt.’ The ‘wrong place’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope goes down again. If you land in the right place, you keep moving forward. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important.
At first, it was hard for me to ignore my fear and go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to slow down, so I landed on the flat area. I didn’t fall, but I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. 
On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied the moves we would do while ski-jumping, and others helped us know where our bodies were in the air. Gareth told us what to do. I needed to work on my ‘aerial awareness’ – I only noticed when I was about to jump and then I found myself in the foam cubes. 
We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes before I finally landed correctly. Gareth was happy for me, and I felt proud. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last jump of the day, I made myself go fast, jumped, and landed in the right place. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope, no longer on my feet."""

Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold on tight. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage goes slowly up. Then, there is a quick drop, and your stomach feels funny. You go fast forward, turn left, and then go upside down. You feel scared and scream. But you chose to go to the amusement park, just like many other people do every year.
Amusement parks are very popular and make a lot of money. To make the exciting rides that people want, there are many engineers and designers working hard behind the scenes. They create rides that are fun but also safe. Designing rollercoasters is not easy. It is important to make the ride exciting but also to keep people safe. 
Many of the ideas for rollercoasters were created by a designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. He made rides that were very thrilling, but they were not always safe. Now, designers have to follow rules and use special designs for the rides. 
I talked to some experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, who is a ""thrill engineer,"" said that the skill is in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts explained that it is important to make people feel like they are being thrown around but still safe. 
To create a great ride, the teams must think of a fun story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase. They also want to make the ride taller, twistier, and have steeper drops. However, Professor Walker said that experience and testing are very important. Jeff Hornick, a director of theme park development, agreed that it helps to love thrills when designing rollercoasters.
I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, would change rollercoasters. Walker said that while new technology can be exciting, the real experience of the rollercoaster will always be the most important part for many years."

At 25 years old, Miranda Ellington has done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things with her busy schedule. She says, “Dancing again helps me remember what it is like to be in a studio and follow the orders of choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget how hard it is to rehearse all day.”
As a choreographer, Miranda teaches young students. She enjoys this work. She says, “A new dancer is often open to new ideas. Working with students can be easier than working with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they do not always know their strengths and weaknesses. This means they can accept criticism better. Sometimes they challenge what I say, but I like their honest feedback.”
When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. She says, “There may be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers do not respond well to the music, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I cannot just choose a new piece of music. I wish I could try different pieces to make rehearsals more fun. But now, I always work on big productions where the music is already decided.”
Miranda does not want to stay with one place. She says, “It is important to meet new people. But I must remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I have to change how I work each time I go somewhere new. This helps me not to get stuck in my ways.”
We talk about a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, “Some documentaries look nice but are not true. This one shows real life in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections. I smiled because I understood her struggle. She knows she is not doing it right but cannot make her body do what is needed. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not see how much work and dedication ballet needs.”
I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She says, “It is when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Perfection is hard to achieve, but aiming high is important. It helps to cover up some mistakes. I have worked on productions where the dance steps are good, but the costumes or props are distracting. That is disappointing.”
Miranda has done many types of work, so I ask if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She replies, “People want to label you, but I do not understand why. There is a trend to focus on one area of expertise. I do not agree with that, but maybe one day I will be known for one thing. For now, I want to explore more.”"
116,B1,"""A friend asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that TV shows many amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to see and do? This conversation gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was giving away his old sofa, and it became the star of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to the sofa and used old seatbelts to hold it on my shoulders. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it every night, even one night on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and encouraged me to keep going. I have walked on foot many times, but this was very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I could stop at cafés to relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to tell them how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can see the film on my website."""
117,B1,"""I was excited when I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands. I had never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person because many families go to the islands. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would join ten other people to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and helped me get on the boat.
Before we started, our group had sent emails to each other, but we did not have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would be with us, and they showed us how to talk to it. We swam a short distance to split us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I saw faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this swim, and I was very happy when I did it by myself.
The next days were similar: jumping in, swimming at a comfortable speed, and stopping to look at the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I swam faster and enjoyed them more. I did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come back next year."""
118,B1,"""Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it is a great job. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with amazing people, I have a lot of free time, and my job is never boring. This is good for a young person like me! 
When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers. Some of them let me help. 
Later, when I wanted to change my job from banking, I remembered this. At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people like me. They were also changing careers. I practiced what to say before the interview. I talked about my skills and my work experience, not just that I loved to travel. Because of this, I got the job!
I think this job is good for many people. There are many reasons to like it, but free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard. There is a saying: 'No one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family. Even if we do not see each other all the time, we are still close. 
When I am not working, I do not take work home. If I have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!"""
119,B1,"""At the summer camp where I work, I enjoy seeing the children do things they thought they could not do. Most of the children can swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they try and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel very happy. 
At the start of the week, some children miss home. It is not the youngest children who feel this way; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time.
Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call a lot to ask how their child is. This is not necessary. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other things, so we tell the parents to call back later. We also see some children who come dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."""
120,B1,"'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after five years in the USA, where it won ‘Best Musical’ four times! Doing the show with all-British actors was not easy. The UK has rules about how many performances young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 
The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night. Everyone wants to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful Gibson guitar.’ He told me that the young actors are very busy. ‘We have normal school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends,’ he said. 
What do his friends think of the show? ‘My whole class came! The theatre has special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 
The young actors were already musicians, with some playing different instruments, but none had played in a band before. They found it easy to play together. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is worth seeing.'"
