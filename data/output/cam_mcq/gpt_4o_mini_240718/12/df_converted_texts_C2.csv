1,"Text: 'Some time ago, a website pointed out the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also revealing your location to many people, not all of whom you may want to meet. This highlights a growing awareness that there can be negative aspects to the constant sharing enabled by the internet. The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to wealth and fame. However, we often dive into this digital world, sharing personal stories and photos, only to realize later that it can be overwhelming and risky.

This situation may seem discouraging, but there is hope. The future has been mapped out for us by early internet pioneers. In the beginning, these pioneers explored the internet and identified its dangers. They faced job losses, changes in friendships, and the challenges of fame long before social media existed. These early bloggers have experienced what many of us are now facing. It is important to learn from their experiences, as those who do not learn from history are likely to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the World Wide Web, which was mostly used by graduate students, scientists, and a few young people like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his life. He created a complex online autobiography filled with personal stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was straightforward: anyone who crossed his path could be featured on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some may see this as exhibitionism, there was also a unique beauty to his work that many would consider art.

However, one day, visitors to Hall’s site found his homepage replaced by a single, emotional video titled Dark Night. In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog was removed, but the issue remains. Sharing online can be wonderful, but if you think that sharing your life will make people want to be around you, you may be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Sometimes, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker sent the link to her blog to all the vice presidents at her company, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers studying online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes the feeling that we can say things online that we would never say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a few months, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once a symbol of the risks of online sharing, she has become skilled at managing her self-revelation. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, that doesn’t mean we should.'"
2,"Text: 'Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to suggest that there is much we do not understand about our universe. How can any scientist disagree with that? While scientists can sometimes be arrogant, even the most confident physicist would not claim to know everything about the cosmos. However, some scientists felt it was necessary to publicly warn against the film, using strong language like ‘atrocious’ and ‘very dangerous’. This made the film seem like a must-see. 

At first, I didn’t understand the fuss. Various scientists made harmless statements about how new discoveries were showing the universe to be stranger than expected. It was only when the film discussed some of these discoveries that I began to see the reason for the excitement—discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. I had heard before about a Japanese researcher who claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the film only provided pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to positively and ugly after being exposed to negative emotions. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is simple and can evoke positive feelings. But among scientists, the common reaction is skepticism. 

I understand their point. The idea that thoughts can affect water is fascinating and suggests new forces in the universe. However, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Beautiful pictures of crystals, while nice, are not enough. The real issue is that the film’s claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that seems to come from nowhere, which could be related to a force driving the universe's expansion. The evidence for this is not just pretty pictures; it comes from years of research in labs and observatories worldwide. 

In fact, discoveries are being made that confirm the film’s claim that the universe is stranger than we thought. Astronomers have discovered that the universe contains an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy’. Additionally, more down-to-earth discoveries are equally surprising. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay we do not notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest links between life on Earth and the fundamental design of the universe. 

Despite what some may think, science is not close to being complete. In fact, we seem further from knowing everything than ever. It is clear that many natural phenomena cannot be understood as we once thought. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that there are limits to our knowledge. This has led some of the world’s top theoretical physicists to work on a Theory of Everything, which aims to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Overall, many of us believe that the universe can best be described in one word: incredible.'"
3,"Text: ""In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, while writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes complement each other, creating a landscape I cherish. The trees provide shade, and the wind rustles the leaves, which sometimes turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the gentle change of seasons. 

Since I began my career as a fiction writer, I have often alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a set of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing may engage different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. 

I started my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I began writing short stories. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was challenging, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my beginning as a short-story writer.

One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Generally, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can take longer). It’s not the same total commitment required for the year or two it takes to write a novel. You enter a room, finish your work, and leave. For me, writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. So, writing short stories provides a necessary change of pace.

Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas—an idea, a word, an image, or anything. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can simply accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This thought comforts me. 

You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories. In this way, short stories serve as a kind of experimental space for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment the way I like within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, faint footprints of my journey. I remember exactly where I placed each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these intimate feelings with my readers."""

Science, at its core, connects with philosophy, but it also has practical uses, like curing diseases. It has improved our lives but also posed threats. Science seeks to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, yet it often falls short. It influences poets, politicians, and thinkers, but its beauty is sometimes only seen by those who study it deeply. People often misunderstand its dangers, and its significance can be both overestimated and underestimated. The history of science is marked by constant change and conflict. Established ideas are frequently challenged or replaced, similar to how new music styles are initially mocked before becoming popular. Scientists can be competitive, and jealousy and anger are common emotions in their field. 

This book will explore scientific ideas that have transformed not just science but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, we will focus on its concepts and their beauty, while also recognizing the limitations of human understanding. Science is always evolving, with new discoveries often disproving previous explanations. Most of the time, these changes do not disrupt society, but sometimes they challenge our established beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science introduced the idea of a mechanical universe, but by the 20th century, physics began to question this view, leading to complex ideas about how we interact with the universe.

Some people see the changing nature of scientific theories as a weakness, but these changes often improve our understanding and ability to predict natural events. For instance, Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein advanced our knowledge even further. Science may face setbacks, but it continues to progress. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists believed there was little left to discover, yet soon after, groundbreaking discoveries like radioactivity and quantum mechanics emerged.

Biology has also made significant advancements. Today, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe's origins. However, science is not just an academic pursuit. Over the last two centuries, we have shifted from merely observing nature to influencing it, sometimes disrupting its balance without fully understanding the consequences. 

It is crucial for everyone, not just scientists, to engage with scientific advancements, as these developments will shape the future for generations to come. The implications of scientific progress can impact everything from government budgets to the health of future children and the overall future of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had leveled off or even declined in some cases. This raised questions about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can coexist, the debate about whether ebooks will replace print books continues. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this idea, it remains a topic that sparks our imagination and intense discussion. 

Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers to these questions extend beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the notion of one medium 'killing' another often arises with new technologies. Even before digital technology, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many believed radio would disappear. However, radio adapted and found new audiences, such as people listening in cars or at work. 

The idea of books disappearing is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated itself with movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones, all of which were once thought to threaten print books as cultural sources. Some believed that the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks in a digital future. 

The idea of the death of the book often arises during technological changes. This narrative reflects our hopes and fears about such changes. To understand why these feelings are so common, we must recognize that we form emotional connections with different media as they become part of our lives. Studies show that we can develop strong attachments to objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or expressing frustration at our laptops. Therefore, when new technology, like e-readers, emerges, it not only signifies economic and social change but also forces us to rethink our relationship with something that has become essential to our daily lives. 

As technology evolves, we often yearn for what we once knew but no longer have. This longing is why industries arise around retro products and older technologies. For instance, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe led people to seek original manuscripts. The transition from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the earlier format. The same occurred with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Unsurprisingly, e-readers have sparked a renewed appreciation for the physical qualities of 'old' books, including their unique smell. 

This should reassure those who worry about the decline of print books. However, the idea of disappearing media will continue to be an engaging story about the transformative power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we cope with change is by using familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and endings. The narrative of the death of the book is easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"Text: ""For a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday morning. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I focused on the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—to offer a new perspective on their personalities and careers. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, 'Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.' I would say, 'Tell me what time you eat and if you take a nap afterward.' This book may seem superficial because it looks at the conditions of creative work rather than the work itself. However, it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about the writer's inner self, which is true. 

My main concerns in this book reflect my own struggles: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not claim to answer these questions definitively; some may not have clear answers and can only be resolved through personal compromises. However, I have provided examples of how many successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas can be broken down into small daily actions and how working habits can affect the work itself.

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focused on people's routines. Routines can seem ordinary and thoughtless, like being on autopilot. Yet, a good routine can help you use limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism effectively. A solid routine creates a path for your mental energy and helps manage your moods. The psychologist William James believed that putting part of your life on autopilot through good habits allows you to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule.

Interestingly, it was a moment of procrastination that inspired this book. One Sunday afternoon, while working at a small architecture magazine, I was supposed to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself tidying my workspace and making coffee. As a 'morning person,' I could focus well in the early hours but struggled after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers' schedules. I found many entertaining stories and thought it would be great to collect them, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was informal; I shared descriptions of people's routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I have gathered a more extensive and well-researched collection while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I have let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources. I must acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."""
7,"Text: 'Howard became a palaeontologist after a rise in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, a careful man with a big mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast, and on a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was interested in the very beginnings of life, rather than the more famous areas like dinosaurs. He studied small creatures found in grey rocks. As he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would get a job, especially in the institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving a job does not always guarantee getting one. When the Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London opened, he applied, though he did not expect much.

On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and the professor who replaced him was someone who disliked Howard’s former professor. This man managed to ensure that Howard got the job. Howard was surprised by this unexpected support and felt grateful until a colleague later explained the situation to him. He was a bit disappointed, wishing he could believe he was chosen for his skills and personality. However, what mattered most was that he had the job and could do the work he loved.

Howard often compared his orderly professional life, where he could plan and pursue scientific truth, with the chaos of personal life. Many people can affect your life, and sometimes a stranger can change everything, as Howard discovered when his briefcase, containing notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station. Upset, Howard returned to college, called to explain, and postponed the lecture. He reported the theft and then went for a coffee. There, he met a colleague who was with a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This conversation led Howard to learn about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied, which would be his biggest challenge and secure his future. Because of the theft, he quickly changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi.'"
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. He mentions that he has ice cream made from bee larvae at home, which may look unusual but supposedly tastes ""slightly nutty and floral."" One of Spence's goals is to make eating insects more acceptable. As a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, he studies how our senses work together to shape our experience of taste. His research influences what we eat and drink, from large food companies to high-end restaurant menus.

Spence and his colleagues explore how various factors affect our taste experience, including who we eat with, how food is presented, and even the color and weight of plates and utensils. His book, *The Perfect Meal*, co-authored with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers interesting insights about dining. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant tends to enjoy their meal more? Also, we eat about 35% more food when dining with one other person, and this increases to 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab in Oxford is quite simple, filled with basic equipment. He has soundproof booths and older audio-visual tools. By keeping costs low, he can collaborate with chefs who may not have the funds for research. Much of his work is supported by a large food company. Traditionally, research funded by the industry was viewed negatively in universities, but now it is seen as valuable, especially since the government wants universities to show their work has real-world impact.

Spence is currently assisting well-known brands in reducing salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Interestingly, many companies make these changes quietly, so consumers do not notice the difference. Spence explains that when people are informed about these changes, they tend to focus on the taste and often dislike it more.

Spence first met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a major food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was unappealing, even though food is inherently scientific. Blumenthal's partnership with Spence led to the creation of the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in his restaurant. Spence notes that a century ago, Italian futurists experimented with sounds and food, but it did not become popular. Now, the food industry is applying Spence's research on sensory experiences to many products. For instance, he found that higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter.

An airline is planning to match music with the meals served to passengers, and a well-known brand recently launched an app that plays music while ice cream melts, although they did not match the music to the taste, which is often overlooked.

What are dinner parties like at Spence's home? One time, they had rabbit served with the fur around the cutlery, and another time, they experimented with remote-controlled, colorful light bulbs. They have even hosted dinner parties with tone generators, headphones, and various drinks to test how different pitches affect taste. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his research lab."
9,"Text: 'Our brains are more active than ever. We are overwhelmed with facts, false information, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information that we must sort through to find what is important and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us find items in stores. Now, we handle most of these tasks on our own. We are managing the work of many people while trying to keep up with our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, with our smartphones assisting us. They have become part of the modern rush to fill every spare moment with activities. However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking – doing several things at once – this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, there is a mental cost. We are not like expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, hurriedly moving from one task to another, neglecting the ones not immediately in front of us, but worried they will fall apart. Even though we feel productive, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. It has been shown to increase stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can overstimulate our brains and lead to confusion. Multitasking creates a craving, rewarding our brains for losing focus and constantly seeking new stimulation. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we rely on to stay focused, is easily distracted by new things. This is ironic because the very area we need for concentration is often sidetracked. Just having the chance to multitask harms our cognitive performance. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this issue info-mania. His research indicates that trying to focus on a task while an unread email is waiting can lower our effective IQ by nearly 10 points. Wilson found that the cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by tiredness. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, discovered that learning new information while multitasking sends that information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information from their studies goes to the striatum, which is for storing skills, rather than to the hippocampus, where facts and ideas are organized and made easier to remember. Moreover, multitasking often involves making decisions: ‘Should I reply to this text or ignore it? How should I respond?’ Decision-making is also taxing for our brains, and even small decisions require similar mental effort as larger ones. This can lead to a state of mental exhaustion, where after making many trivial decisions, we may end up making poor choices about important matters. In discussions about information overload with business leaders and scientists, email frequently arises as a concern. It is not a rejection of email itself, but rather the overwhelming amount of communication we receive. When the son of my neuroscience colleague was asked what his father does, he replied, ‘He answers emails.’ My colleague acknowledged that this is quite accurate. We feel we must respond to emails, but it seems impossible to do so while accomplishing anything else.'"
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they struggle to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were often ignored. Animals had behaviors that led to measurable results, and science focused on those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral systems was considered overly sentimental. However, this view has started to change. Research on the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions, which were once a taboo subject. This shift has influenced popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This change has sparked a debate that may never be resolved: do animals have consciousness? This debate leads to another important question: do animals have a moral sense that guides their actions? 

In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more joy—by jumping and kicking—than those that had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we produce and consume beef? While the observations may be accepted, their meanings are debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" argues that the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the brink of a major ethical change, similar to the abolition of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, thinks we should reconsider our understanding of animal intelligence, suggesting that animals have a simpler version of our theory of mind. Professor Euan MacPhail believes we should avoid attributing human emotions to animals. These three perspectives may never agree because the core issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks, what it is like to be a bat? 

Balcombe describes an important experiment he conducted that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can experience depression. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other lived in small, bare cages. Initially, both groups learned to eat only from a box with tasty worms. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a poor environment made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He states, “We look back with horror on a time of racism. Our views on animals will one day be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He notes, “What we are seeing is a swing in perspective. At the start of the 20th century, some believed animals thought like us, and there was a backlash against that. Now we are moving back toward that idea. But it is a very controversial topic, and we should be cautious of academics with strong personal opinions.”"
11,"**Simplified Text:**

Critical thinking is a way of engaging with what we read or hear to gain a deeper understanding. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., notes that many believe that arguing helps us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are growing worries that it changes how we solve complex problems and makes real thinking harder. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but appealing ideas, trends, and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to think clearly. Ironically, having more data does not necessarily lead to better knowledge or decision-making. West highlights that the quality of our thinking has not improved much despite the increase in information.

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading has dropped by 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media has a cost. She suggests that the decrease in reading may be linked to a decline in critical thinking, as people are more focused on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one task.

However, there is no clear answer about how technology affects critical thinking. The presence of technology has made critical thinking more complicated, and scholars can no longer depend on the beliefs they once had. It is easy to see technology, like computers and video games, as either good or bad, but the truth is that they can be both, and different technologies can lead to different outcomes. For instance, a computer game might help or hinder critical thinking. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links can prevent deeper thinking.

Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how people think. She observes that reading enhances thinking and sparks imagination in ways that visual media, like video games and television, do not. Reading develops imagination, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are real-time and do not allow time for reflection or analysis. As a result, many people, especially younger individuals, may not reach their full potential.

How society views technology influences its understanding of critical thinking. This is especially clear in the debate about video games and learning. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games are not necessarily harmful to children. In fact, they can be a valuable learning tool. Evidence shows that playing video games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging, virtual environments that mimic the real world. These games also allow players to explore ideas that might otherwise be difficult to access. As reading and math scores decline in the digital age, it is important to examine how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the value of manual trades, while his latest book discusses how to handle modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on a credit card machine during a brief delay while entering his pin number. Crawford realized that these distractions are becoming harder to escape. What we focus on at any moment is personal, but we are often unaware of how outside forces influence our choices. It is increasingly difficult to think or remember conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, we isolate ourselves and may even stop engaging in simple interactions, like talking to strangers. Crawford notes that we often experience the world through representations designed to capture our attention, such as video games and apps, which can take over our desires.

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many office workers complain about emails but still spend their free time checking them. Research shows that our attention can drift if a phone is visible, a common experience for those who feel drawn to their phones during dull moments. While there is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, it is clear that we are more aware of other activities we could be doing. Some might think this issue is purely technological, but Crawford believes technology has simply amplified our self-obsession. With endless choices, our self-control is challenged, affecting our social interactions. We often prefer texting friends instead of risking a face-to-face conversation. By only interacting with digital representations of people, Crawford warns that we may lose something essential in our society.

Screens are just part of the issue. For example, in his gym, there used to be one shared music player, which could create tension due to differing tastes. Now, people listen to their own music through earbuds, and the gym has lost its social atmosphere. Genuine connections often arise from conflicts, such as differing opinions on music.

Crawford suggests a two-part solution. First, we need to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled practices to connect with the world more meaningfully. He cites cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people who must interact with the physical world. No digital representation can match the real experience of feeling a hockey puck on ice or gravel under motorcycle tires. These roles require good judgment and the ability to navigate social interactions.

Crawford argues that engaging with the world in this way reveals how manufactured experiences are inferior to real ones. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is crucial to find ways to use our judgment. There are many benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what truly matters. In contrast, concentrating on one thing can improve our ability to pay attention to other things as well."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, as we often identify ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. It feels acceptable to say you study or teach philosophy, but claiming to be a philosopher might suggest you think you have special knowledge or insight. This idea is misleading; philosophers are just like everyone else, but this stereotype makes me cautious.

So, why do people have this view of philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who evaluate the actions of others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical living, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers fully agree, there is still a cultural connection between philosophy and intellectual thought. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting societal norms without questioning them leads to dissatisfaction. Our ability to reflect on the world gives us control over our lives and helps us make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not require extensive reading of philosophical texts or a life focused solely on intellectual thought. It simply means paying closer attention to our daily experiences to ensure they are meaningful. You do not need to be a wise person, separated from society, to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is vital for a good life.

This brings me to another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers: as philosophy has become a profession, it has become more disconnected from the real experiences of people, especially those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are linked to expensive academic journals, making it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. For many, philosophy can seem distant from everyday life. While some philosophers have tried to challenge this view, many have accepted it. The academic environment has led to a separation from society, and as discussions have become more technical, it has become difficult for those outside the field to understand them.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the area of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully represent my work, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and values. There is a new trend in philosophical thinking where ethics is seen as applied ethics, which examines the fairness of specific social practices. The role of the ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then move on to consider our views on responsibility, art, and consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people reflect on the practices and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes this reflection confirms what we already know; other times, it reveals that our beliefs are difficult to defend. Regardless, by examining these ideas, we contribute to the benefit of everyone."
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can enhance our enjoyment of food. However, historically, discussions about food in philosophy have often been secondary to other philosophical topics. When philosophers have discussed eating, it has usually been a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, there are philosophical discussions that seem to be about food, but a closer look shows they are exploring different, loosely related ideas. 

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who promoted the idea of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain across various human activities. Despite this, Epicurus is often associated with a love for eating and drinking, as seen in the names of restaurants and food websites. Businesses likely hope to gain from this association with a famous philosopher. 

Food is inherently social and cultural. The food we eat comes from historical contexts and is shared within our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions and the systems through which food is produced and distributed. We interact with food more often and in more essential ways than with any other product, making it a clear subject for philosophical exploration. 

Once food is prepared, critics begin to discuss it. But why do these critics hold such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, influential food critics are simply better at describing flavors. This area has been overlooked in philosophy, as most studies on perception have focused on vision, which should change. 

Another important aspect of food is its aesthetics. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the beauty of food's taste. Some philosophers argue that, with the growth of modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in discussions of aesthetics alongside art forms like sculpture or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike visual or auditory art, which remains. Aesthetic objects need to last over time, so it is incorrect to consider food a proper subject of aesthetic value. 

There are also many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? The answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will question why we hold these beliefs, making such discussions about food worthwhile. 

Another topic is the difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, based on love and friendship. In a home kitchen, everyone is included as we share food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have obligations to their employers and the food itself, meaning their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more about colleagues than friends. 

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ explores how food and dining can help bridge cultural divides. This happens in two ways: first, we learn to appreciate others by enjoying their food, and second, we build personal connections with people from different cultures by sharing meals, a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The text is enriched with many delightful examples and stories, making this aspect of food philosophy engaging for the general reader.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, from the United States, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he enjoyed as a child were no longer fun or challenging, so he began to think about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect future games? He modified a classic game called Risk to create a new version: Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and long-standing rivalries become part of the game. Daviau explained: “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Daviau was later invited to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy received much praise, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story coherent. To do this, they hire testers to see how the games develop. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. You might have a situation where the first few games are great, but then after four or five games, it starts to get shaky, and by game six, it’s broken. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When he was developing the idea, Daviau thought it would appeal to a small group. He said, “When I was working on it, I thought: ‘This is really different and I think it’s pretty good,’ but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest advancements in game design in recent years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement. There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than to learn a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of an unfolding adventure outweighed any worries about the game lasting. He mentioned, “At first, I was worried about making changes and possibly ruining my board, but that concern was eased by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t go to the cinema to watch the same film twice, do they? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling aspect similar to video games.” The legacy format is influenced not only by video games but also by the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau thought he would become a television writer, but he moved into advertising and then game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but it’s not enough to just have a general outline.”

While Daviau feels a sense of ownership over the idea, he is curious to see how others will develop it. However, he also tries to downplay its importance, thinking that gamers will soon ask, “What’s new?” Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less certain. He believes the legacy format has been a revelation. He said, “It’s the kind of idea that changes how you think about what a board game can be.”"
16,"Text: 'Recently, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children’s movie, became popular online. Part of the enjoyment comes from seeing animals as similar to us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very intelligent and look very different from humans. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways. 

Some people think that seeing animals in a human-like way is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually a mistake to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this mistake ""anthropodenial."" After studying many years of research on animal intelligence, he shows that animals, except for having fully developed language, display many behaviors once thought to be unique to humans. These include thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding the intentions of others. In other words, animals are smarter than we often believe.

De Waal thinks that anthropodenial is a recent idea. In medieval and early modern Europe, people believed that animals had enough intelligence to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed our understanding of evolution, wrote that the difference between human minds and those of higher animals is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, behaviorism became popular, focusing on training animals through rewards and punishments. During this time, many people viewed animals as simple machines or robots with instincts. Those who believed animals had inner lives were often seen as unrealistic. This change in thinking happened at the same time that humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly.

Fortunately, de Waal believes we are starting to recognize animal intelligence again. He notes that there has been a lot of new information about animal cognition shared online in recent years. He argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits of each species. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid their nuts, something we often struggle with.

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might focus on how many color patterns we can create on our skin. If we failed, the octopus might think we are not very smart. 

De Waal is cautious about Inky’s escape. He believes that while octopuses have escaped before, it might be too hopeful to think Inky knew how to reach the ocean. However, he understands how powerful stories like Inky’s can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (a food they like) and others received grapes (which they like even more), the monkeys with cucumbers became upset when they saw their friends getting grapes. This study was published in a well-known scientific journal, but what really made people believe the results was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our unique way of thinking about animals can influence our understanding.'"
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once a topic in science fiction, is now set to cause major changes in technology, similar to the impact of industrialisation. While robots have been used in car manufacturing and other industries for many years, experts believe we are approaching a point where robots will be used widely in many areas. However, many people are not ready for this change. 

Most people see robotic automation as a disruptive force. Interestingly, about two-thirds of people think that robots will take over most jobs currently done by humans in the next 50 years. Yet, around 80% believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not. Every industry will be affected by robotic automation soon.

For instance, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X, which can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This task would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is Tally, a robot from a San Francisco startup, which moves through supermarket aisles to check that products are stocked, placed, and priced correctly, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation argue that robots currently cannot maintain or program themselves, which could lead to new, skilled jobs for technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not forget the importance of human skills in the workplace. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come from reducing human interaction.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how this technology is changing the workforce. His recent report indicates that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work safely with humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field are expected to rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers.

Zhang stated, ‘Automation and robotics will impact lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. The best way for them to adapt is not to rely on the government to protect their jobs, but to find ways to retrain themselves. People cannot expect to do the same job for their entire lives anymore.’

Additionally, advancements in motion control, sensors, and artificial intelligence will lead to new types of robots for consumers, including robots that can live and interact with us in our homes. This presents a great opportunity for companies ready to embrace these changes, but it also brings challenges, such as the need for new regulations to protect our safety and privacy.

With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is essential to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce that will include robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a mountaineer, is famously quoted as saying he wanted to climb Mount Everest ""because it’s there."" This response reflects a common question people have: why do some individuals choose to engage in such dangerous and seemingly pointless activities? Mallory's answer may encourage others to pursue their dreams and face the unknown. However, it also suggests that the main reason for climbing could simply be for adventure and enjoyment.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He identified seven different types of climbing activities, from bouldering to climbing high peaks, each with its own rules. He argued that the approach to any climb, such as the amount of equipment used, should depend on the specific rules of that activity. Over time, this perspective has become popular in discussions about climbing in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and casual conversations.

Many climbers love the sense of freedom that climbing provides. Yet, climbing can also feel restrictive. For instance, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing. However, some argue that the limited choices in climbing can simplify life, which can also feel freeing.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of our nature; humans are wired to take on challenges and test their limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing may be more about our biology than logical reasoning.

US academic Brian Treanor adds that climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are especially valuable in today's risk-averse society. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits, helping people develop the qualities needed to thrive in everyday life.

Another interesting idea is that climbers who depend on themselves rather than others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that climbs done independently are more challenging and deserve more recognition than those completed with teams or artificial aids, like bottled oxygen. This claim raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Exploring climbing outside the Western perspective reveals that climbers often experience being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, the meditative state while climbing, and the intuitive problem-solving involved are key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of peace. This offers another perspective on why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Over six decades, pianist Alfred Brendel established a prominent place in classical music. He was an intellectual and sometimes serious figure who explored and recorded important European piano works. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he taught very few students. Those close to him saw a playful side, but this was rarely shown in his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of study, travel, and performance.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel backstage after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist: “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, something about the 14-year-old boy caught his attention. After listening to Kit play, Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit played beautifully and had a rare ability to connect the music from start to finish.

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to make his mark, though Brendel worries about him burning out too soon. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps a close watch. He also composes music. Brendel emphasizes the importance of learning to read music by trying to write it yourself. He noticed Kit’s incredible memory, excellent sight-reading skills, and his sensitivity to sound. Kit not only understands Brendel’s instructions but can also apply them throughout a piece of music.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations. He dislikes when newspapers label Kit as the future great pianist of the 21st century, saying it can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit can play some pieces exceptionally well, while others require more time and experience. It would be unfair for critics to expect perfection from him.

Now at 80 years old, Brendel shows a softer side in his retirement. He reflects, “When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I hoped to achieve certain things by age 50. When I reached 50, I felt I had accomplished most of those goals, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Although I may not have the physical strength now, my mind is always active with many pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform anymore, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.”"
20,"Text: ""When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My Grandad’s garden was by a river, sloping gently down to the water. Although you couldn’t reach the river, you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors, who used old window frames and patched them with plastic where glass was broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed using phrases like ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ even though ‘I don’t mind’ would have worked just as well. Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it never happened. He was skilled at home projects, creating amazing bookshelves and cupboards.

My parents only moved house once during their marriage, but my mother loved changing furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I later asked my mother why I wasn’t given the chance, she simply said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could escape into my imagination there. With a fishing net and old sandals, I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and search for fish. After failing to keep them alive in the backyard, I returned them to the water.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until one day my father said, ‘There’s an opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, he went against his usual judgment. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think he saw my passion for gardening. Even though he didn’t enjoy gardening himself, I believe he noticed my enthusiasm for plants and flowers."""
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is crouching on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I am too. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the steep cliff at our feet and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, approaches, and his owner gently strokes him. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. He shows me around, pointing to nearby islands. “That’s Eigg to the north, and to the west is Rum, which gets a lot more rain than we do,” he shouts over the wind. I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s tall mountains. “Beyond Rum is Soay,” he adds. 

Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep, and we start walking down the slopes. He shares interesting facts about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; the geese here eat a lot of grass; and his family has lived on the island for 3,000 years. As we walk, Tie the sheepdog tries to herd the sheep but struggles. “Away to me, Tie,” MacEwen instructs, meaning the dog should go to the right, but Tie goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. MacEwen sounds disappointed, and Tie looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mainly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, manage the farm; their son Colin takes care of the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary enjoys that her two boys can explore the island and sail dinghies during summer. “They leave the house and come back only when they’re hungry,” she says. However, living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is not always available. On my first evening, I anxiously wait for the lights to come on, and the next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “You can get reception on the hill,” Mary explains. “Most people last a couple of days before putting their phones away.” I decide to do the same.

Life on Muck is full of surprises. A boat arrives today with groceries and three musicians who come to perform in the island’s tearoom. Their concert is a great success, and the islanders enjoy the music. That night, as I sit by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father bought a small farm on Soay after seeing it in a newspaper, without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” I ask if she knew how to run a farm. “She had good typing skills,” he replies.

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. However, I eat well, as most of my food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish, which I bring back to her kitchen. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, incredibly delicious. The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled recently due to rough seas. If my ferry doesn’t arrive, I might be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I would not mind at all."
22,"Text: 'The game design industry was once mainly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals, and it didn’t offer many ways to enter. Often seen as just a hobby for young people, the video games industry is now taken seriously. This may surprise some, but industry experts are not surprised. However, entering this field is not easy. Video game spin-offs that come out quickly after a new movie need many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, getting into game design is challenging, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, “It’s very hard to make progress in big companies or to influence major mainstream games. But the industry needs game designers now more than ever. Not just top-level directors who manage entire games, but also those who design systems and individual parts.” 

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim disagrees. “The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed independently if you aren’t making things. Game design is more than a job; it’s a way of life. Like any creative work, it must be practiced to be real.” Another expert, John Field, offers different advice. “While ‘just doing it’ is important, it’s more complex than that. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s requirements today; even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit needed to contribute to this evolving field.” 

Can you succeed on your own? “Maybe, but it’s quite difficult,” says John. “A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide valuable support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and have a strong passion for the arts and contemporary culture. They may have spent some time working after graduation but have realized that games are their true passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety of the medium. Finally, networking is important. This is often overlooked, but to advance in games, as in many fields, you need to make connections.” 

The stereotype of a young boy playing video games has changed to a more accurate view of games as a serious medium that captures our attention. Families often engage with interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is much room for growth. “Games have become popular among larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this already significant area as full of new possibilities and opportunities.”'"
23,"Text: ""Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very demanding. He often said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I’m glad that didn’t happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score great goals by practicing. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players collide on the field, but I learned proper techniques. When I teach kids, I focus on helping them enjoy learning skills. At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that education is important, but back then, football was my main focus. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that his habit of kicking the books around doesn’t mean he is just like me. 

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could join the first team, but he never made a big fuss about it. He didn’t gather us and say, ‘This is your chance to prove yourselves,’ but we all understood the importance. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a well-known TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his comments. I depend a lot on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes create issues. For instance, people often ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents financially; I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and I think they would be upset if they felt they should rely on me completely. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to help those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, and it doesn’t solve all my problems. After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I retire. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg while skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."""
24,"Text: 'Sam Carter was the reason we lived at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. Out of desperation, he offered to find us a cheap place to stay because my father couldn’t write anything while we were in Los Angeles, and Sam was at risk of losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was often empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point rarely attracted day visitors. The road was not inviting, and the nice resort of La Carmella was nearby, so most people chose to stay there. Only those who were broke or really loved surfing would make the last mile to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, the beach was full of people and activities. My father was busy every day trying to finish a script, and he was in a bad mood. While he worked, I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first arrived at Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to join us. I tried to send him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but it was just a weak attempt to scare him off. Rusty knew this and got closer. I asked my father, ‘Who does he belong to? He acts like he belongs to us.’ My father replied, ‘You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim much faster. You’d think he would give up, but he never did. That day, after swimming, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. They would choose a wave and balance perfectly as they rode it to the shore. One surfer caught my attention. She was so graceful that the others looked clumsy next to her. When she decided to stop, she rode in on a final wave. ‘Hi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’ ‘I don’t have a surfboard.’ ‘You could get one.’ ‘I don’t have any money.’ ‘You’re British, right? Are you visiting?’ ‘No, I live here.’ ‘Is your father American?’ ‘No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.’ ‘Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’ ‘Rufus Marsh.’ ‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that book from start to finish.’ She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that this was how it usually was. They were friendly but only showed interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning.'"

The line was spilling out of the area marked ‘Departures’. Her friend Annie had told her, ‘It’s best to arrive late at the docks. If you get there too early, you’ll just be waiting around.’ Annie, who was married to a diplomat and had traveled a lot, usually gave good advice. But this time, she was wrong. 

After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a ‘breakdown in the computer system.’ This news made the atmosphere among the waiting passengers tense. Some tried to be patient, while others attempted to stay cheerful, but most people became frustrated. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and many felt it was their last chance for a bit of luxury. The fact that they couldn’t board the ship smoothly did not bode well. Violet felt like leaving. She reached into her bag for her phone and realized it was missing. This was more annoying than the long wait. It made her question whether going on a cruise was a mistake. 

Now, she had the added problem of her phone. She couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it in the cab because all her contact numbers were stored in her phone. This was the very mistake her older son Harry always warned her about. Behind her in the line was a friendly-looking couple. ‘I’m sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make a quick call?’ Violet used the couple’s phone to call Harry and left a message asking him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if the phone was left behind. If it wasn’t in her apartment, she would be in trouble, as she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she didn’t tell Harry this. Harry believed he was more experienced than his mother, while Daniel, her younger son, was more understanding of her mistakes because he made them too. Dan might forget to pass the message to Kristina.

Eventually, the line started to move, and Violet approached a window where she handed over her travel documents and got ready to board. Her heart sank further when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a not-so-grand hotel trying too hard. There were shiny fake wood panels, fancy chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets that looked like those in airports. Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’, which were lined with mirrors and packed with tired passengers who might have preferred not to see their reflections. She was squeezed against the side of the lift as it moved up, stopping at each floor to let people out. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out into freedom. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to ensure she had a sea view."""
26,"Text: 'When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was uncovering the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he discovered 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer known for her captivating photos. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked around and realized he was on the brink of something significant, all by chance. ‘When I bought this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I could have easily sold it all to someone else.’ For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together details of Maier’s life. They reached out to families who had employed her as a nanny and spoke with staff from the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier, who was somewhat private and unique, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘On her day off, the camera was around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person with strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and film. Although she was not very social, she walked the streets with her camera and sometimes interviewed people on audiotape. She seemed to be dedicated to her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist who followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘Nothing stopped her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; she did not create it for commercial reasons. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. ‘What is fascinating about Vivian is the number of interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style. ‘Was Vivian sophisticated enough to do this on her own, or did she borrow ideas from others?’ Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever sort through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof began taking his own pictures. ‘As I improved as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I was holding something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to share her name and ensure Vivian Maier is recognized in history.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often suggests that it has not fully succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very successful, and she was at the center of a lot of attention. Despite being in her twenties, she remained calm. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass, and the official asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have occurred, leading a council of 12 men to come together to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. At over 800 pages, the book is “big by necessity” because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded thoughtfully. “It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels part of the success. There’s a family-like feeling at home; I received a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.” She also mentioned that it annoys her when people assume her book is not a philosophical work.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part being half the length of the one before it. This structure makes the story speed up as it progresses. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she aimed to create a book with structural patterns that readers could discover if they chose to look for them. 

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Interestingly, Catton did not plan the story in advance. “I would write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be to get out of that situation,” she said. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers. 

We also discussed her love for television dramas, noting how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would consider screenwriting. “That could be pretty cool,” she replied, her enthusiasm evident. She becomes animated when discussing her writing and New Zealand. “I notice how much my imagination changes when I’m in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for more populated areas to experience the energy of other people.” For now, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."

As a boy, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either building things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has made steel-string acoustic guitars by hand. He says, “I am still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood create such a beautiful sound? Different types of wood make different sounds, and that still fascinates me.”

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of getting a job to buy one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood affect sound and how to put them together. The bass guitar was the first instrument he built from scratch, but he had been building model boats and planes with his brothers for a long time. His father taught them how to use tools, and Jonny had also repaired instruments for his friends.

Although Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, he hadn’t thought about making guitars as a career. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university because it involved design. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out because he felt too different from the others. He realized that guitar-building was a form of sculpture that involved creating sound, and he thought it might be a more practical career than pure art since people actually use the guitars.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he worked part-time cleaning windows to earn extra money. His first guitars were sold for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a skilled guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, he says he is “still scratching a living.” He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the early years, Jonny focused on getting his name out there. He attended music festivals on weekends, letting musicians try his guitars and encouraging them to share his name with others. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which was difficult for him.

Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. “When I started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good,” he says. “UK-made guitars were not seen as valuable, even though we have always had good training programs here. Now, our handmade guitars have the reputation they deserve.”

He thinks new instrument-makers should take courses to learn valuable techniques, but he also believes that learning through trial and error is important. “You should look at other instruments, see what works and what doesn’t, and try different things,” Jonny advises. “If you make the back too thin or too thick, the sound won’t be good. Learning from someone else teaches you only one way, but being self-taught, like I was, helps you learn everything.”"
29,"Text: ""When discussing English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a common practice, and I will reference the well-known statement by the 18th-century writer Dr. Johnson, who said, 'When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather.' This statement is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many commentators stop here or struggle to explain why the English seem so focused on the weather. They often make a mistake by thinking that our discussions about the weather are genuinely about the weather itself. They assume that English people talk about the weather because they find it interesting. 

For instance, the American writer Bill Bryson points out that English weather is not particularly exciting. He notes that in England, we do not experience extreme weather events like tornadoes or blizzards, which are common in other places. In response, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that English weather is indeed interesting. He believes that the English fascination with the weather is not about strong feelings; rather, it is about its unpredictability. He states that while we may not have tropical storms, living on the edge of an ocean means we can never be sure what the weather will be like.

From my research, I believe that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point: our conversations about the weather are not truly about the weather. Instead, talking about the weather serves as a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, phrases like 'Nice day, isn’t it?' or 'Ooh, isn’t it cold?' are not really questions about the weather; they are common greetings or ways to start a conversation. In this sense, English weather talk is similar to 'social grooming' seen in monkeys and apes, who groom each other to bond socially.

There are specific situations where weather talk is used. Some writers claim that English people talk about the weather all the time, but this is not accurate. In reality, there are three main contexts for weather talk: as a simple greeting, as a way to break the ice before discussing other topics, or as a fallback topic when conversations stall and there is an awkward silence. This does lead to a lot of weather talk, which makes it seem like English people discuss it constantly. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, include some ice-breaking weather talk, and then return to weather talk during pauses. This is why people from other countries, and even some English commentators, think that English people are obsessed with the weather."""
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build a structure that is 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were excited about this trip, choosing it over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the Wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not enough. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to provide context about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching for 31 years, Alice began her new career as an author in 2001. 

Although she had a successful teaching career, Alice felt she was stepping into the unknown. She compared teaching to acting, saying it was physically demanding, while writing was exciting but less exhausting. Her former colleagues envied her because she still connected with children through her stories. Alice aims to fill a gap in children's fiction, noting that much of today’s adolescent literature focuses on negative experiences or is purely fantastical, like Harry Potter. Her books are different from both.

Alice always taught English and History together, using lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel ""Tale of Troy."" She is motivated by her love for children and is fascinated by the moment when a child goes from boredom to interest and from confusion to understanding. She enjoys the challenge of engaging bored children, seeing it as her responsibility to make learning exciting.

Her desire to write her first novel was partly inspired by the approaching ""empty nest"" as her two sons were leaving home, and a surprising recommendation from her head teacher to attend a creative writing course. Initially, Alice was hesitant, thinking she didn’t need the course after 25 years of teaching. However, she had to submit her best piece of fiction to be accepted, and just days before the course, she quickly created a story about a Roman couple expecting a baby. After three hours and 30 pages, she submitted it and was accepted.

During the course, her classmates reviewed her work positively and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she requested a year off from her school to write her first novel. Alice's husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was crucial in editing her novel. She believes they complement each other; he focuses on improving her writing, while her instinct is to keep adding more scenes. This difference highlights the roles of a fiction writer and an editor."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to participate in a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and rugged Yorkshire Dales in northern England, starting at Semerwater lake and finishing at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high.

As they prepared for the race, Jonny expressed his excitement, saying he had never done anything like this before and was looking forward to the beautiful views from the car. Alistair, dressed in warm cycling gear, was also eager but joked about Jonny’s driving skills, saying he might stop for tea during the race.

The race began, and Alistair quickly took off on his bike, heading straight up the hill. Jonny got into his car and started driving. However, just 15 seconds into his drive, he encountered a large tractor blocking the road. He complained to the cameraman about the delay, saying if Alistair won, it would be because of the farmer.

Once past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair struggled with the steep incline. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, which was a strange sight for the sheep nearby. After a tough climb, Alistair finally reached the top and began to pick up speed as he rode down the other side.

Meanwhile, Jonny faced more challenges on the narrow roads of Yorkshire, which were not designed for fast driving. He carefully navigated through tight corners and a stream on the road. Both brothers were unaware of how close they were to each other as they approached the finish line.

As Jonny accelerated towards Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing through his last field and back onto the road. When Alistair reached the finish line, he looked around and asked if Jonny was there. When he found out Jonny had not arrived yet, he celebrated his victory. Moments later, Jonny arrived in his car, disappointed but congratulated Alistair, saying he was upset about losing."
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The well-kept grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a calm atmosphere that protects you from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. What I struggle with most in a tennis match is to focus only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by loud applause and cheers when a point ends. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t realize there are fifteen thousand people watching every move I make. I am so focused that I don’t think about the millions watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not too hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer won easily, more easily than if I had believed in myself more. But my loss in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have played better; it was not my skill that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and let it slip away. Toni, my tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me, even when I win. It shows how upset I was that he told me not to cry and that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand; this might have been my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment matters, but some moments matter more, and I had missed a big one in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to ease my pain. But he was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat; this time, my mindset would be strong. The best sign that I was ready was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family and friends the night before the final, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to mention it, but they understood that I was already preparing for the match in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that space in my head was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always longed for.” Her name was Jane Goodall, and she would spend most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, the National Geographic Society helped make her famous by publishing articles and documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writings, including popular children’s books and the bestselling book In the Shadow of Man, published in 1971, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real accomplishments. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on sentimental aspects and do not fully capture her work. She has been portrayed in various ways: as an adventurous girl, a privileged woman who wanted to live with wild animals, and a determined feminist. These portrayals can diminish her true contributions. 

Based on academic references to her research, the success of her students in biology, and the extensive data from her forty-year study, Jane Goodall should be recognized as a pioneering zoologist. More simply, she opened our eyes to the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools, and we did not realize they share emotions similar to humans or have social systems like ours. Goodall discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have unique cultural traditions. Her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), is the most important work in chimpanzee research and serves as an encyclopedia on the subject. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and influenced how humans view themselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives.

Even as a child, there were signs of the person she would become. One clear example occurred in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, she disappeared, prompting her mother to call the police. Neighbors and family members joined the search. After a frantic search, Jane reappeared alone, with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had crawled into a henhouse, hidden in the straw, and stayed still for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."

In our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of a playful 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to fans of children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she explains, “so I had to quickly learn how to say many medical terms.” 

Shirley shares what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even well-known ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there’s more to it. You need to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions because of their fame, but often they don’t get the roles because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a traditional acting career. During the course, she occasionally sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she recalls, “the studio manager suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors often provide voices for young boys and girls because their voices are lighter than those of male actors. Hiring child performers involves complicated procedures and many forms, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds and to vary her voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for voiceover work is intense, and having a good showreel – a recording that showcases what the artist can do – is crucial. “It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley advises. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her field through determination as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also thinks a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over, and I’ll speak like that for hours, maybe even days,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in completely different voices.”"
35,"Text: ""People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many dream about as children, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and choose more practical careers, such as tax lawyer or auto parts manufacturer. The idea of making a living by drawing simple pictures, like those in high school notebooks, seems silly at first. Yet, some people do just that. 

Becoming a cartoonist is not the same for everyone, but most who succeed have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist, loving comic strips, contributing to school publications, and being known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was fortunate to find someone at a newspaper looking for political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, they liked them, and soon I was earning enough to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your mind, your hand, and something to make marks with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. While the technical requirements are low, it is still a challenging job. One should only pursue this career if they feel they cannot do anything else. It is much easier to find a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living from your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I accept all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t want to do. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of cartooning? In the past, many cartoonists could find steady jobs with different newspapers and magazines. However, those days are fading. For most today, cartooning is an entrepreneurial activity, meaning you must not only create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with this process, the more successful you will be. I have seen many cartoonists with average creativity but strong business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ circle it, and write your name and the date next to it. But realistically, it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it’s not a disaster – it could actually be a lucky opportunity!"""
36,"Text: ""Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. Among other items, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of even useless items, so why did I want to throw this one away? I took it to the dump and was about to leave it on a pile of trash when a young man approached me, looking confused. 'You’re not going to throw that away, are you?' he asked. I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could take it, and I said 'Yes.' We parted ways, but in the following days and years, I felt a deep sadness for what I had done.

Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it ten years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened this email from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer and restorer named Keith Rushton. He told me, 'I’ve got your electric guitar.' It had been sold several times since the young man at the dump took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back of the guitar. He realized it was probably outdated but used my name to find me online. He eventually contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was overwhelmed with emotion. I would have given him anything, but his price was very fair. I had forgotten that my dad always put name-and-address stickers on my belongings, including my guitar. How my dad would have laughed at this strange situation!

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar when I was young, as it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the calming sound of the classical guitar, which was forgiving to beginners. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound terrible when played by someone just starting out. However, I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar, playing simpler songs. This was also the time of punk music, where anyone could be a rock star, even if they weren’t great musicians.

When I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith sent me, I vividly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play but quickly stood up, putting a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are meant to be played standing. My fingers instinctively knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for the chords, but my hands just moved into position. My middle-aged fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or perhaps there are others my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves 'The Regainers!'"""

Recently, there has been much discussion about sleep. When I wrote the book *Insomniac*, which focuses on people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and emotions. Anyone who has trouble sleeping knows that sleep is essential for our overall well-being. Interestingly, those who find it hardest to sleep often understand its importance the most. It is encouraging that sleep is finally receiving the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. There hasn’t been much talk about them. We often lose our dreams. When you wake up early, missing the last hour or two of sleep, you mainly lose REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which is when most of our dreams occur. Our most vivid and powerful dreams happen during REM sleep, especially just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, meaning that someone who lives to be 90 years old will spend around six or seven years in this stage. When researchers prevent people from experiencing REM sleep, they find that the next night, the amount and intensity of REM sleep increases to make up for it. This suggests that dreams serve a purpose.

When REM sleep was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the focus shifted to the physical reasons behind dreams rather than the psychological ones. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are significant. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams much better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as film is one of the most dream-like forms of human expression. However, I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? 

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from our past and present to create new associations. Dreams may help us discover new patterns and combinations that challenge our usual ways of thinking. For instance, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They tend to think outside the box and combine ideas in unexpected ways, which is a key aspect of creativity. Personally, I find that I write better after experiencing intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one that I can barely recall, seems to inspire my thoughts. On those days, words and images flow so quickly that I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t fully understand how this happens, but it does seem to work. 

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and everyone needs their brains to function well. We all need to think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, which has a stunning view of the sea, you see several empty frames on the walls, along with happy photos of her two daughters. As a leading artist in the copyist art movement, who can recreate the beauty of early 20th-century impressionist paintings and 16th-century Caravaggio portraits, it seems unusual that she has no paintings of her own. “I don’t keep any,” Susie says casually. “Once I finish them, they go.” The reason is that Susie is very popular. Over her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by many famous artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts often mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions at auctions, her copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal most of her clients, even when asked, but they include galleries and private collectors. While many collectors truly love art, some are more interested in status. One famous buyer likes to show off his “Van Gogh” painting, which is actually a “Susie Ray Van Gogh.” “Many well-known people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank safe and displaying Susie’s copy instead. 

Susie has always been honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she aims to make it look as real as possible, believing that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. However, she signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as the real thing is illegal, and although she knows people who have profited from that, she has never been tempted. Those who create fakes often face serious consequences. Susie mentions that she isn’t wealthy and has faced challenges, but her situation is more stable now, and it wouldn’t be wise to risk her reputation with collectors and artists. 

Susie didn’t always work as a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. Looking back, she sees that it helped her develop skills for her current work and sparked her love for plants, even though it was hard to make ends meet. She explains that she had to be very precise and get things right on the first try. She has no regrets about that time but is happy to have found a more financially rewarding career. When younger artists ask her for advice, she emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to master her craft. Her training allows her to create everything from plant drawings to perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces and 20th-century abstract art, although she now focuses on French impressionists, particularly Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 

Susie notes that many people think modern art is simple, almost like child’s play. However, she believes that impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very careful, making their work more challenging to replicate. Given her talent, it seems strange that Susie doesn’t create her own art. Isn’t art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She explains that her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own pieces, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—acceptable, but not impressive. It’s like living on plain food after enjoying meals prepared by a top chef. What stands out about Susie is her perfectionism."
39,"Text: 'During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest on it. This obsession began in her childhood. She felt a unique connection with the boats that took her around the world; they worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life felt unimportant, and she often longed to be back on the ocean, challenging nature even in places that had almost defeated her. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she invited me to see the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher, which had been her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She shared how meticulously she planned her supplies, calculating exactly how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly displayed her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, a tiny gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her attention to detail in keeping the boat was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her entire world, and she cared for it because her life depended on it. Now, she views the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, fragile thing with limited resources. 

Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she assisted with a bird survey on albatrosses. ‘It made me stop and think. It gave me space to see things differently and realize ideas I hadn’t considered before.’ The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. ‘It felt like we just took what we wanted and moved on. That’s our behavior.’ When I arrived at Ellen’s office, she was finishing a heated conference call. She then explained why immediate action is necessary to protect the planet. ‘Coal, oil, and gas are no longer being made. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways to avoid wasting them. Initially, my message was negative – to use less – but I gradually saw another perspective.’ Now, she focuses on reusing materials, passionately discussing items like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, speaking with government and business leaders about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ‘I will never be an expert,’ she admits. ‘But I absorb information like a sponge. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Compared to this, sailing felt selfish. This is about discovering how my voice can be most effective. It truly matters.’ She also founded the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that collaborates with businesses and educational institutions to inspire young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ‘I do miss the adventure of being at sea,’ she says. ‘It defines who I am. You feel connected to everything around you. There’s no time to feel lonely. You focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message will never be as simple as saying: “I’m going to be the fastest around the world.” I may have been the fastest, but this work surpasses everything I’ve ever done.’"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous among teenagers. He hopes to encourage other kids to explore the outdoors instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he becomes a teenager.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They agreed that a young climber might be strong enough physically, but they were unsure if a teenager could handle the emotional challenges. They also questioned whether a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing.

The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can't focus on it – we have a lot to do. I think about possible problems, of course. Karen and I always consider the risks, but we believe our experience as climbers will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""

I also wonder about Jordan's reasons for wanting to climb. Is this just a father pushing his son to achieve something dangerous? Paul insists, ""This project is not about me wanting to be famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, 'Why not do it now?' We talk to him often to ensure he still wants to do it.""

When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about this challenge, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal."" In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting event. The more exciting the record, the more attention it gets. This creates a problem for Jordan. While some people say that focusing on achievements can take away from the enjoyment of challenges, if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He has to do something impressive, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I have just started a music degree, but my classmates know as little about classical music as most people our age. If you don’t know who composed the music, you probably don’t own any of their recordings. This situation is concerning for classical music lovers. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only about 300 copies. This is hard to believe. So, why is there less interest in a music style that has existed for centuries? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I like many styles, but my classical music listening is probably close to that 3% figure. 

So, why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, can be challenging for us. We prefer fast conversations, quick games, and rapid thoughts. Experts say we struggle to pay attention for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to enjoy, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Additionally, pop music often deals with topics that interest teenagers, unlike long classical pieces without lyrics. 

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would gather to make music together, and playing an instrument was valued. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that audiences at classical concerts have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many of those new attendees are teenagers. In my orchestra, we perform classical music in various places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more people enjoy classical concerts as they age, but I do know that if teenagers’ parents love something, they often try to avoid it. 

Some believe that schools are to blame for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are eager to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it’s not their preferred music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you regret I came here,” she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the other side and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie wouldn’t have minded if she had. Her mother understood how Bonnie felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings scattered among the trees on a hillside; it was quite confusing at first. Then she noticed the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved through the trees. “I wish you’d walk next to me instead of trailing behind like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t seem to expect Bonnie to do so. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be kicked out soon anyway, so I might as well get it over with.” She left the building and headed towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was a charming old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one in sight. She approached the horses with a sense of respect. The horses were well cared for, and she noticed that immediately. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, carefully observing each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. The next horse caught her attention. “But aren’t you the best of the bunch!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. Lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. They can’t be far.” Bonnie was thrilled to find that the room with the riding gear was unlocked. Engrossed in the fun of putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she climbed onto the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in control of everything around her. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed happily as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I’m serious, I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. “If I stay here, I think you and I could become great friends,” she confided. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was thrilling, a gentle breeze brushing past her cheek. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"Text: 'I have met Cody Simpson before and have always admired his calm confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? “I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven,” Cody recalls, explaining how it all started. “But I was swimming and surfing every day. Those activities were more important to me back then; I had a full life and many things to keep me busy. When I was 13 and in high school, I posted a few videos online.” These videos changed everything. He began by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos. So, Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share. The responses were overwhelming. Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with top coaches and focused on perfecting his sport. But then record labels showed interest, and he faced a tough decision: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the leap. “It was very hard for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. “It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,” he says, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy industry.” So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family across the world, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody believes it’s important to have a close circle of good people around you to stay grounded. Of course, everyone has moments of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight, and he’s traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how that affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.” Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big opportunity, even when it’s a bit scary. “It all happened so quickly and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m visiting countries I never thought I would see and performing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s something many people dream of achieving. But I know it won’t last forever.”"
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to stop the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I had worked long hours with most of the town’s adults, showing I could handle the job. My grandfather didn’t seem to notice. With one hand on the curtain, I scanned the half-mile stretch of steaming black water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. Fragile ice shelves lined the sides, and solid ice was downstream. As I took off my pajamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. I didn’t recognize him. I frowned. Amazingly, he was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from an expedition in South America. This chain is much more special than having a famous grandfather, and only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that journey, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and walked to the kitchen. 

“Morning, Rex,” my mom smiled as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he stepped out of his room. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious from my wetsuit, and he had seen me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s been harder lately. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His harsh words hit me hard. I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came in with a sympathetic smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I held back from saying he had always been like this. But, like Mom, I try to be kind to him. When I was a child, he was my hero – ever since he first showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang framed on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. 

Mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even on these cold days!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my expedition.” 

She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Text: 'Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her into the study, where she saw an unframed painting on the table, leaning against the wall. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously unfinished. “Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” 

Jess looked closely at the painting. A river took up most of the scene; it was not a river she recognized, and it might not even be real, just a fantasy. The painting was strange and beautiful in a haunting way. The riverbank was barely visible, just a hint of green that the eye almost missed, drawing attention to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people; it felt right that way. It seemed there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, she felt drawn to it, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed her excitement. Jess understood why; Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted and let others interpret them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: “River Boy.” The words felt strangely significant to her, but she didn’t know why. 

Then she noticed something else. She looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” 

“Exactly. It’s strange, isn’t it? For him to be so specific. But he hasn’t finished it yet, so maybe he’ll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” 

“Mum! You should have known better.” 

“I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess his response.” 

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. “He told you it’s not the artist’s job to explain a painting because each one has its own life and language, just like a poem, and we either understand it or we don’t. He said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone…” 

“Mum, he said ‘ignoramus.’” 

“… every ignoramus what it means. If artists had to explain their work to everyone who asked, they’d never get anything done. And he said…” Mum interrupted, laughing. “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.” 

“Inspire?” 

“Someone who motivates an artist.” Jess knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually said it to describe how the muse wasn’t helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a tough part to work on. He never suggested that the muse was her. In fact, she always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. “He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He’s been painting all his life.”'"
46,"Text: 'This morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I’m not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the moment, as things often do. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me quite often. 

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. Now, I keep my collection of shells and fossils there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was excited when she gave it to me! 

The problem is, it’s a corner cabinet, which means it has to fit in a corner. I only have two corners in my small bedroom, which is shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is for Mum and Dad; the back one is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and my room is the size of a broom cupboard. Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. When Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I’ll be stuck in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. Then I thought, if I can’t cut the cabinet, why not cut a hole in the carpet? It seemed like a good solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that’s exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"The novel ""The Borrowers"" tells the story of a tiny family that lives secretly in the walls and floors of a house, borrowing items from the larger humans to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the book, I knew it would be challenging to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how things should look. I used the original illustrations from the book a lot because I wanted to avoid criticism. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, which made filming more complicated. 

A key aspect was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing adventure, we had to position the camera ten times further away than usual. To capture the Borrowers' perspective, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. 

One major challenge was creating realistic shadows when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we achieved it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, filled with oversized objects to make the actors appear small. It was wonderfully surreal. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really got into it. The coins we used were larger than dinner plates and hard to lift, often making the crew laugh, which sometimes interrupted filming.

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they found it so scary that they didn’t need to act. A crucial part for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they would stick out like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to move; she couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because regular fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail with the costumes!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was difficult for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of each scene to show how they should look, and by the end, I had created 2,000 drawings. They weren’t perfect, but they were helpful. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly; I once filmed an entire scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But in the end, everything came together, and I believe the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Text: 'Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting journalists that aren’t there. I wonder how long it will take for the chaos to start. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones asking for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life on the road with tour tutors. While the rest of the band is renting here for recording, we are staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet real kids. How about a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns? That would be so cool. 

I walk into the school’s main office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I tell the secretary. “Name?” She looks unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary seems confused. “Oh,” she says and types “McGraw” on her keyboard. That’s good because few people recognize my last name since my dad uses his stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One moment, it’s printing,” the secretary says. Then she rips the sheet and hands it to me. English Literature, first period. Great, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look foolish searching for my classes. 

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” She continues while I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my very normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses in the attendance. “Desert... McGraw?” she says carefully. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she actually lets us socialize! All teachers should understand how important this is. 

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have many options. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a recording studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, lies work better. “What does he do?” she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care. Great.'"

Today, American teenage girls are expected to be very active. They often need to be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. Being an average teenager is no longer enough. Many believe that not having high ambitions is a sign of laziness. Kristen Loose, a teenager, explains that adults often forget how much pressure teenagers face. They have a lot of homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to maintain a social life.

Despite these pressures, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist. They are often seen as lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these stereotypes, many do not think it is fair to label all teenagers this way. Loose points out that people assume teenagers spend most of their time on their phones or watching TV. She admits to having her phone nearby but uses it for important tasks, not just for fun. For many teens, their phones help them manage their lives better.

With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons. Schoolwork now requires attention all day and night, which can be exhausting. Many teenagers start their day around 6 or 7 a.m. and often stay up past midnight. Their days are filled with school, activities, family duties, and homework, leaving little time for sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. Additionally, 28 percent of teens reported falling asleep in school at least once a week due to lack of sleep.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week, which is not much considering there are 168 hours in a week. She does not spend much of that time on social media or TV; instead, she focuses on volunteering. Olsen believes that many people think teenagers are only interested in themselves. However, she finds joy in helping others and looks forward to making a positive impact in her school and community.

In the future, the stereotypes about teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these views and make a difference in the world. There will always be new generations of students who are making their mark before they even finish school."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This ongoing science project is both an astronomy experiment and an outdoor adventure, which is likely why teenagers join. I visited them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a bright trail of light.

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box were a camera, an altitude measuring instrument, and a thermometer to check temperature changes as the balloon rose. Two GPS trackers were placed on the outside of the lunch box to help find it later. A gas tank, given by a supporter from a nearby state, was used to fill the balloon, which slowly grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get the gas tank. “I didn’t really mind,” he said. For kids in this club, that’s normal.

Finally, it was time for lift-off. “Five, four, three, two, one,” they counted down, and the balloon began to rise. Some of them ran and followed its path with bright flashlights until they could no longer see it, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder. Then the balloon vanished into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at a sky so clear that it was hard to believe they were only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” said one girl quietly. “I know,” whispered another. A meteor streaked across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, causing the balloon to expand until it was almost the size of a house. Then it popped with a loud bang. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Retrieving it wasn’t easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. “Recoveries are a big part of the program,” said the group’s leader, noting they’ve only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.”

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students are familiar with the Eastern Sierra,” their leader said. “What seems wild and dangerous to some is just a normal part of life for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera didn’t capture any shooting stars. While this was a bit disappointing, it also led to a discussion about atmospheric waves and how they might behave above mountains. And it became another adventure story to share with anyone who asked."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she turned fifteen. Her interest began by chance when her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a phase many children go through. Although she initially dismissed his interest, she helped him with a science project and found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology that amazed her. She realized she wanted to pursue this field.

Chloe recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite his young age. She felt nervous at first, worried he might see her as just an annoying kid. However, she felt more comfortable when he showed patience and listened to her questions.

When discussing how palaeontologists are portrayed in movies and TV shows, Chloe expresses her frustration. She acknowledges that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but they often misrepresent palaeontologists. She feels they are either shown as eccentric geniuses or socially awkward individuals, which does not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explains that her job is diverse. She spends time digging for dinosaur bones, working in laboratories to analyze fossils, and writing scientific papers. Although not always required, she also believes in the importance of communicating scientific findings to the public, especially to young people. She wants to inspire them to learn about science, using dinosaurs as a way to spark their interest in the natural world.

Chloe contributed to the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, where she provided advice to ensure accurate portrayals of dinosaurs. She found it easy to help because there were few inaccuracies to correct, mainly ensuring that the dinosaurs shown lived during the same time period. The documentary attracted viewers of all ages, showcasing the latest knowledge about dinosaurs, which differ significantly from those in movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes dinosaurs continue to captivate us because they represent the explorer within us. They spark our imagination and the desire for discovery. In a world that feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still much to learn, and Palaeontology offers a unique way to explore the past."
52,"Text: ""I want to say this clearly: when you are traveling by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not ‘there yet,’ even if you keep asking, ‘Are we there yet?’ The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not ‘there’ anymore; it’s ‘here.’ So if you think you might be ‘there’ already, you should ask, ‘Are we here yet?’ I’m sure no one wishes to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear that question repeatedly on long car trips. Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You could watch DVDs you’ve never seen, listen to music, or do puzzles you’ve had for a long time while enjoying the beautiful views outside the window. Meanwhile, in the front seat, there’s a parent with a map, giving out juice boxes and cookies, adjusting the radio, and making sure everything goes smoothly. 

But then, someone in the car does something annoying—usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he’s leaning over into my space, and a fight starts. The driver and the other parent have to reach back to separate us while the car swerves. They tell Tim to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself, which calms things down for a bit. 

As we drive on, I try to read, but then I feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing his breath in my direction. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. This makes me angry. Tim gets yelled at again, and the car swerves more. Eventually, things calm down again. 

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask, ‘Are we there yet?’ he often replies, ‘Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.’ But we are still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour. Then he says, ‘Oh, well, maybe we’re not there yet.’ This keeps us quiet for a while. You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults jump out of the car and move as far away from us as possible after all those hours. So remember: if Mom and Dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You’re not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: “There’s so much technology. Everyone is busy on their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve screens. It’s natural for people to connect and communicate.”

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged until the end, so no one feels left out. This idea was further developed in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players work together to win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, designed by North American Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players must work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the book. He recalls, “When I played that with friends, we felt scared and excited. In the end, everyone felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to create something similar.”

Leacock’s love for board games began in childhood, when he often felt disappointed after playing. “Games were my favorite birthday gift,” he says, “but I would get excited, open the box, and then feel let down.” With help from his game-loving uncle, young Leacock would redesign games to make them better. Pandemic became a huge success, and its follow-up introduced even more storytelling. Leacock explains, “It’s like an electronic game where you develop characters, learn new rules, and the story evolves.”

Interestingly, the growth of the video game industry has helped the popularity of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games. Ben Hogg, who works for a major games company, says, “Everyone is a mobile gamer now. Most people with smartphones have at least one game they enjoy.” 

For a while, video games allowed some social interaction, like playing together at arcades or on the couch. However, as multiplayer games moved online, players became physically distant from each other. This led some former video gamers to seek out ways to play games with people in person again. 

As seen in John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our increasingly online world, games are now something to be shared directly and physically, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has created and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are crucial in the music industry, even if your career starts with many setbacks. He mentions that his mother was an ""amazing singer"" who encouraged him to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was a local one aimed at middle-aged listeners, which influenced his musical tastes as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he did at a national level, and pursuing music. He often spent his lunchtimes in the school music room learning songs on the piano. He recalls, ""I was quite good at tennis, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do forever. It was just too much hard work.""

At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a decent guitarist but not as passionate about performing. Jamie remembers telling his parents, ""This is what I want to do. I’ve been writing lyrics in economics class and playing the piano every day while others were outside."" His father gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After several close calls with record labels, he was signed by a music publisher at 19 based on one song. However, the labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Ultimately, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. However, fame and success did not come easily. He reflects, ""In my own artist career, I feel like I’ve often been in the wrong place at the wrong time. But as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time."" Writing for other artists is where he truly excelled. He believes he is one of the main writers that UK labels turn to for new artists, helping them launch their careers.

Sometimes, he has to explain to the artists he works with that aiming for chart success is not something to be embarrassed about. He asks, ""Why don’t you want to? Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?"" He emphasizes that they should aim to create something amazing that will also sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music openly express their desire to write hit songs. Jamie is not arrogant; he simply understands that he wants to write number one hits and has the talent to do so. Instead of worrying about how others perceive him, he focuses on his goals. He states, ""When I go into the studio, we need to aim for global success and write the best music for next year. It’s not just about what’s trendy; we want to create classic modern pop songs."""
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity: a big star online, but likely unknown to those who don’t watch videos of people doing bike stunts. He is a ‘street trials cyclist’—he jumps from difficult places like roofs or walls to land safely in other challenging spots. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I interview him one Saturday morning at a BMX park, the local kids recognize him, and even some older people come to show their respect, calling him ‘an absolute legend.’ After seeing his skills, I agree with them. I came with doubts, but I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and I often can’t believe he will succeed. However, when I compliment him, he seems uninterested and a bit down. Despite his online fame, Tony says he is not comfortable with being a celebrity. He finds the social aspect challenging. He understands the importance of connecting with fans, but he prefers to focus on doing stunts rather than talking about them. This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that capture his stunts. He reflects, ‘This technology allows people like me to earn a living.’ He feels that many people are always filming themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t fully agree with that. Still, he is not complaining. Through his videos, he makes a good income from what would have been just a hobby in the past.

After years of interviewing top athletes, I’ve learned that two key factors help a passionate child become a top competitor: energy and the ability to handle emotional disappointment. These traits may be more important than talent and help build the mental strength needed to keep going despite failures. In the park, Tony fell a few times on what he considered easy but new challenges. He simply got back up and kept trying until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, ‘Those who criticize me may care, but they don’t understand. They probably haven’t ridden a trials bike and don’t know the sport. They don’t see that I get advice from experts to reduce risks.’ In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, ‘People are different. Some never feel scared, and they shouldn’t be doing these sports; it’s important to recognize the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those who can overcome fear and those who can’t. I belong to the group that feels fear but finds a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes, I ride around for a while to get in the right mindset before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm just before I jump. If I fully commit, I’ll be fine.’"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she used a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!” On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterward. “I’m glad it’s over!” Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. He had previously written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.” Jeff wanted a unique touring bike and decided to build one himself. He thought a penny farthing would be the most interesting choice, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, which ended due to a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He noted that while he met cyclists who could ride up mountains, he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more people were amazed by it. His toughest experience was having to drink dirty water from a stream, which caused him a serious fever. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for hospital bills or a way to get home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the United States, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have recently started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’ that helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their population has decreased significantly, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about their activities during the day, but we know very little about what they do at night because we did not have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, allowing us to learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat.

Our work is challenging. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in various locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and record every duck I see. The weather has been difficult; some nights are warm, but many are rainy. It is so quiet that I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. Despite the challenges, I enjoy this work, especially when I think about the summer, which will involve long hours in a laboratory analyzing our findings. Being inside will be tough, but it is necessary. I wouldn’t change this experience for anything!"

Tasting is a crucial part of ensuring that customers receive high-quality chocolate bars from my company. Each week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate from our factory, and I need to check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to select the best ones for our chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues! My kitchen is filled with machines and ingredients to experiment with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel abroad to buy raw materials, which can be challenging since I have a young family. However, I enjoy the variety and lack of routine in my job, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! People often ask me if I ever get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and enjoy more chocolate in the evening!"""
60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it offers many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching objects like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can attend some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a career in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing repeatedly – it’s essential to keep performances exciting and dynamic. If you want to succeed in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great aspect is the friendships formed with other performers and the opportunity to learn from them. Staying fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is crucial, but the best performers are those who are determined to succeed, have creativity, and continuously work on improving their skills. 

People often believe that injuries are common or that you might only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other career options.” The course also includes business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia cautions, though, that it’s not a profession for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also competitive – but a lot of fun!”'"

Many people believe that backing singers are not as talented as lead singers, but that is not true – they often have to be even more skilled. People like Mariam are the true stars of the music industry! 

“What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a silly tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just do my job!”

“Excellent musical skills are crucial for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There is often no sheet music to follow. I will always remember my first experience recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was very nervous: I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough.”

“One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range works best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.”"

These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular among many celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, from cake decorating to party planning, rather than just going with her first thought. Once she made her choice, not everyone supported her. Julie recalls, ‘Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.’ She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. Although Julie was not familiar with fashion blogs, they played a key role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her products grew, along with the speed at which her company produced the satchels. Julie now enjoys waiting to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online ads, she uses the online community for ideas on new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied Julie’s design to sell similar bags. As a result, she now ensures she has confidence in her production team, just as she does in her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices – people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place.'"

She was a talented swimmer, and her coach believed she had the potential to become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard for her to balance training with her schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and began competing. Vicky found this exciting and decided to try cycling too. She later said it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling daily and performing well. The track was close to her school, so attending training sessions after school was easy for her. Vicky eventually had a successful career in track cycling, winning several competitions. When she turned 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky explained, ‘For years, I enjoyed winning, but I started to feel tired of it all – when the excitement fades, it loses its meaning. Fortunately, I found a new career.’ Vicky began working for a charity called CycleZone. ‘We help young people who have never liked sports,’ she said. ‘Our first step is teaching them to ride a bike. We want them to learn to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does important work, bringing young people together to form a community.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their efforts. Vicky mentioned, ‘Some people doubt that celebrity support is always beneficial for a charity.

64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, music was always present in their home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to take her off the stage. This teacher suggested that she join the school theatre club to build her confidence. After participating in the club for some time, she happily sang with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional. Although she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many of her classmates. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, which inspired her to write the song ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in it each time they listened.

Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join the company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope, and all the tickets sold out quickly, making it a wonderful evening.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments, as she feels there is more to express. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her music, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Text: 'Last year, I went on an incredible trip – a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and wanted to write articles about the journey. He loves boats, although I don’t share that interest. I had dreamed of visiting this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally agreed! A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were visiting. Fortunately, the weather forecast for our trip was calm seas. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry assured me he would handle everything, so I stopped worrying. 

After arriving in Canada, we met the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people live along that coast, and indeed, the only other creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was wonderful to forget about how fast or slow the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all prepared together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each night, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life! When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I return to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to share our adventures with everyone at home!'"
66,"Text: ""My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a child, I watched many of his games. You might think that this would make me love basketball, but it did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often brought a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the practice, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed, and a few weeks later, I played against another school’s team. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t a big change for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""
67,"Text: ""Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and was surprised by how much I enjoyed giving tours. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from the perspective of tourists, and it felt like a new experience each time! After finishing my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I researched what was required, I learned that to get a license as a full-time tour guide, I needed to know much more than I had learned so far. All Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. 

Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. There are many other important skills. You need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and most importantly, you must be able to adapt to changing situations. For example, if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes, you need to handle it well. Tourists do not want to hear about problems or feel like they are missing out; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour. I must ensure that visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I understand that these reviews are very important because good reviews attract more customers. That is why making tours enjoyable and stress-free is essential. For me, the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job usually lead to very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."""
68,"Text: ""My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I traveled to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first experience doing something like this. However, we ended up having a great time. 

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of our day. Josie found it challenging, but seeing the elephants enjoy their food made it worthwhile for me. We also washed the elephants in the river with large brushes and soap, which I found very enjoyable, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we were prepared for that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff would spend the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often mention Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little upset with herself for not fully enjoying her time there because she missed her friends. However, when she reflects on the experience, she realizes how fortunate she was to go. Maybe she will return one day – I definitely will!"""
69,"Text: ""My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to individuals but to various customers, including hotels and offices that use flowers in their reception areas. Sometimes, we provide flowers for businesses' advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle for a wedding, which was a lot of work, but I felt very proud of it.

My day begins at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be cold and dark at that hour, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, filled with flowers from around the world. The beautiful sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were picking for myself, I would choose pink flowers because they are my favorite. However, I have to remember that my preferences may not match what my customers want. Not all flowers are available all year, so I sometimes can’t find what customers ask for.

I don’t enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of my job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. When I return to the shop, we review customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then, we create flower arrangements and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes need to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some might think this is too much work, but I enjoy figuring out how to create beautiful arrangements within a budget. That’s part of selling flowers, and I wouldn’t want to do anything else!"""
70,"Text: ""My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many children's movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized I wanted something more – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs without making a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can track ticket sales online, so we don’t worry about empty seats anymore! There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us how much they enjoyed the experience, it feels great. Our website has been very helpful, and we are now connected with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to see how they operate, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local reviews. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as word of mouth – people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film; last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""
71,"Text: ""Taking photographs was my favorite activity as a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to improve my hobby, so I started a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my perspective and style. I enjoyed photographing many different subjects. Then, someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and began focusing on nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they preferred color. This made me doubt my project at times, and I almost gave up. However, I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher, who told me about a national photography competition for my age group. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment the judges announced that I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good enough for a career. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice."""
72,"Text: ""I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities that help you grow and learn. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you receive a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to accept the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I found myself wanting to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I completed the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had formed good relationships with the children. Now, I spend about four hours a week there, and I always look forward to it. 

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that after I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job or youth work before starting at the club. This experience has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, including one for camping!"""
73,"Text: ""I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The slope looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try it. I was too young to ask him if I could snowboard, but he loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it seem easy, and eventually, I did well. After that first experience, I quickly grew to love the sport and improved my skills. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my passion for participating and winning has only grown stronger as I’ve aged, which motivates me to work harder. I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 in a local competition. I didn’t think I would attempt the jumps that earned me that score until I actually started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. In the summer, I focus on training and studying when there’s no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends, which helps me cope with not being able to do what I love. I need to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I believe it’s important to have another option in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is possible if my active lifestyle allows time for college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."""

One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only get it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try that. I never thought it would be so easy, as it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I needed to be sure they were good enough for other people. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my items to take home. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but we were just two people at a market stall! That’s when I realized it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far."""
75,"Text: 'When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly inspired by Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, “Because of my father’s job, my family moved around a lot, so I learned to make new friends easily. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, which helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, adjusts to a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.” 

Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to spend her time this way. The year before, she had entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. This is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was available in bookstores. 

One review of Being Amelia notes that, despite the cheerful pictures of teenagers on the cover, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer mentions that even though Janine is still very young and her novel is not very long, she has shown that she is a better writer than many bestselling authors. Janine is still adjusting to her fame: “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!”'"
76,"Text: ""My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was excited about this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should accept the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school nearby. However, after we moved, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle is not particularly beautiful, but our apartment there is cozy. In the summer, the island is lively with many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, but there are not many teenagers among them, which I had hoped for. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which can be hard work. 

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to the stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! However, we often enjoy amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then, within hours, it can be bright and sunny again. This still feels incredible, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do experience terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to withstand them. But then I remind myself that it has stood for centuries and is still here!"""
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best spots to see them. It was amazing! After returning home, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am close to achieving it. During family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries as well. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it interesting and commented positively. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I walked onto the stage, knowing that the whole school and my friends were watching me. I relaxed only after it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year! I feel lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not consider birdwatching, but there are many birds to see, especially in green areas. I believe birdwatching clubs should encourage more young people to take up this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to be expensive."

I even started dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a talented player, so he asked the manager of a professional women's club to watch me. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised at first – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I began regular training with a big club when I was just 13. After that, I improved a lot. Still, some people doubted I would ever be a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in my abilities – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. By chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with the large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and allow them to meet other players from my club. It will show them the professional environment and inspire them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times, but also some challenges. I’ve had very few challenges, though – so I’ve been lucky!"""
79,"Text: 'In recent years, a significant change in education in the UK and around the world has been the encouragement for new students to engage in research early in their studies. This change acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists, but is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only for your studies but also for your future jobs, as they help you think critically about the world and your work. 

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just memorize and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions instead of accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research. 

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes in knowledge. However, research can also start from simple inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about various issues and practices. 

Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done research for school projects or answered questions at work since you began your education. You have asked questions that required investigation, whether it was about planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training a pet, or finding the right products online. 

In college and higher education, it is expected that you will have a curious mind, identify problems, critically explore information, and create your own understanding to contribute to discussions. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning often involves listening to teachers and texts without questioning them. It may feel disrespectful to challenge established knowledge or authority, and you might think you should be told what is important to learn. 

However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem intimidating. Critical thinking is essential in research. The research done by others is valuable for students and professionals, but we must not simply repeat what we read as if it is always true. Instead, we should engage with it, think critically, test ideas, and determine if the information is logical and supported by evidence. We should avoid relying blindly on the facts and information provided by others.'"
80,"Text: 'Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity, from the coffee houses of 18th-century London, where people discussed science and politics, to the Left Bank cafés in modern Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. However, living in a city is not easy. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera; Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While modern cities can be places of creativity, they can also feel unnatural and overwhelming. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. It has long been known that city life can be tiring, but new research shows that living in cities can actually impair our thinking, sometimes significantly. One major factor is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly beneficial for our brains. Studies have shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature seem to enhance brain function because they provide a mental break from the stress of urban life. This research comes at a time when more people than ever live in cities. Instead of enjoying open spaces, we are packed into concrete environments, surrounded by many strangers. Recent studies indicate that these unnatural surroundings can negatively impact our mental and physical health and change how we think. Think about everything your brain has to manage while walking down a busy street: distracted pedestrians, dangerous crossings that require attention to traffic, and the confusing layout of the city. These seemingly simple tasks can leave us feeling drained because they take advantage of a weakness in our brains. Cities are filled with stimuli, forcing us to constantly shift our focus. This kind of controlled attention—deciding what to ignore—requires energy. The brain is like a powerful computer, but focusing uses a lot of its processing power. In contrast, natural environments do not demand as much mental effort. This concept is known as attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. It has long been understood that human attention is limited—focusing in the morning makes it harder to concentrate in the afternoon. Kaplan suggested that being in nature could help restore our attention. Natural settings have elements that naturally attract our focus but do not provoke negative feelings, unlike a police siren, for example. In nature, our attention can relax and recharge. Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban settings. Urban parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a much-needed escape from city life. A well-designed park can enhance brain function in just a few minutes. While people have tried many methods to boost cognitive performance, from energy drinks to office redesigns, few are as effective as simply taking a walk in nature. Given the many mental challenges caused by city life, one might wonder: Why do cities keep growing? And why do they remain sources of intellectual activity, even in the digital age? Recent research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that can lead to attention and memory problems—the crowded streets and close proximity of people—are also linked to innovation. It is the ‘concentration of social interactions’ that drives urban creativity, according to scientists. Just as the crowded environment of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the crowded nature of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, supports its role as a hub of technology and creativity. Conversely, less crowded urban areas may produce less innovation over time. The challenge, then, is to find ways to reduce the psychological stress of city life while preserving its unique advantages. Because there will always come a time when someone will say: ‘I’m tired of nature; take me to the city!’"""
81,"**Simplified Text:**

Where should we search for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe there is no strong reason to limit the study of the mind to just the brain or body. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as our brain cells, play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have significantly influenced human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, I propose that what exists outside our heads may also be part of our minds. It is understandable that scientists often connect the mind with the brain because much of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without their usual surroundings. This is practical for neuroscientists, especially when using brain scanners. However, this focus can overlook the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. 

I do not intend to deny the importance of the brain in thinking, but I want to emphasize that the mind is more than just the brain. It is more useful to consider the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the physical world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes into play. MET explores how objects can become extensions of our thinking or be integrated into our bodies. For example, when we create numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool, we are engaging with materials in a cognitive way. 

MET also looks at how these interactions have changed since ancient times and what these changes mean for our thinking. This perspective provides new insights into what minds are and how they are shaped by the things around us. Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick illustrates how minds and objects can be seen as interconnected. It also shows the flexibility of the human mind: by using the stick, the blind person transforms touch into a form of sight, and the stick itself plays an important role. 

The sensation felt at the tip of the stick connects the person to the environment, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can adapt and change significantly by incorporating new technologies. I view the human mind as an ongoing project that is always evolving. 

It is essential to remember that, regardless of what form the ‘stick’ has taken throughout human history—whether it is a simple stone tool or a modern smartphone—its main purpose is to serve as a connection rather than a limit. Through this ‘stick’, humans explore, learn, and understand their surroundings, while also finding new paths forward. This is different from how monkeys use sticks to get food. For humans, ‘sticks’ are tools for satisfying our curiosity. 

This unique human ability to engage with material culture explains why we create things more than any other species, and how these creations, in turn, shape our minds. I call this concept metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and develop as they interact with the material world. I want to reintroduce the importance of material objects into our understanding of cognition. MET provides a new way to see how various forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern devices, have influenced and transformed who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, it is important to realize that humans have been using such technology since our earliest days."
82,"Text: 'Few inventions have changed civilization as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of culture at all levels – practical, scientific, industrial, and aesthetic, as well as in entertainment. Historians argue that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. This claim reflects the idea that photography has become central to US intellectual and artistic discussions, and to understand its impact, we must look at its origins in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so appealing? First, its mechanical process matched a growing interest in technology, part of a national mindset that embraced change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into homes with stunning immediacy. Second, the camera became the preferred tool for representing the self, allowing individuals to create public images in a society where identities were constantly formed and reformed. Third, the camera played a significant role in creating and preserving family memories, even if those memories were somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs aligned with a broader artistic trend towards realism in US art.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. The fact that photographs are made by machines, unlike drawings, gives them a unique quality: they are records of events, people, and things, representing what was in front of the camera and embodying a certain objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by an individual, it also carries a personal perspective. We might look at a photograph and think we understand its meaning, leading to the idea that photography is a 'universal language.' Yet, the meaning of a photograph is more complex. Few subjects convey their own meaning, and every image comes with context that shapes our understanding, such as captions in newspapers or layouts in magazines.

To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and role within its cultural context: Why did the photographer take the image? How was it first viewed? Additionally, the same image can be interpreted differently depending on where and when it is seen. While the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized for a long time, it is now clear. In recent decades, starting with artist Andy Warhol’s use of photographs in his work, artists have been integrating photography in various ways. In summary, photographic vision has become an essential part of painting and our understanding of representation before the invention of the camera.'"
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, which gives us some understanding of what this means. Although we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains a complex concept. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way of knowing about these elements. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not align with scientific facts.

This personal understanding can lead us to make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We often act as amateur psychologists when we share opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing is effective or why people behave in certain ways. Problems arise when two people interpret situations differently. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in various situations. Psychologists help us differentiate between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

While psychology studies the mind and brain, psychologists do not yet fully understand how the brain works in relation to our emotions and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not directly observable. Instead, they must be inferred from behavior, much like solving a crossword puzzle by interpreting clues.

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and modify the processes it studies. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply findings to real-life situations. Psychological research has been beneficial in various fields, such as improving reading methods for children, designing safer machine controls, and helping people express their feelings to alleviate emotional distress.

Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation began only in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to answer psychological questions. They aimed to identify mental structures, which remains important today. However, introspection has limitations, as noted by Sir Francis Galton, who said it only reveals a small part of the brain's automatic functions. William James compared introspection to trying to see how darkness looks by turning up the gas quickly. Therefore, modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than solely on personal reflections."

This museum, owned by a company called GfK, showcases items that were taken off the market because they did not sell well, such as A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product tells a story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved.

Interestingly, the museum operates as a successful business, even though many companies do not keep records of their failed products. Executives visit the museum, showing how uncommon it is for businesses to reflect on their failures. The museum was started by Robert McMath, who initially wanted to create a reference library of consumer products, not specifically failed ones. He began collecting new items in the 1960s, not realizing that most products fail. As a result, his collection ended up being mostly unsuccessful products.

Today’s optimistic culture may contribute to the products found in the museum. Many products likely went through meetings where no one recognized their potential failure. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into failing products to save face. There is often little effort to understand why these products failed, and people involved may choose to forget about it.

This tendency to focus on positivity is also seen in the self-help industry, where the idea of ""positive visualization"" is popular. This concept suggests that imagining positive outcomes can lead to better results. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot has found evidence that our brains may be wired to see the chances of success as higher than they actually are. Her research indicates that well-adjusted individuals often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events compared to those who are depressed.

However, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied the effectiveness of positive thinking. Their findings show that spending time imagining successful outcomes can actually reduce people's motivation to achieve their goals. For instance, people who were encouraged to visualize a productive week at work ended up accomplishing less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our views on failure are shaped by our beliefs about ability. Those with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think that ability can develop through effort and challenges. People with a fixed mindset often find failure very distressing, seeing it as proof that they are not capable. In contrast, those with a growth mindset view failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being challenged. Ultimately, having a growth mindset leads to a more positive outlook, regardless of success."
85,"Text: 'It is well-known that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is this the case? Many people think they understand it, but the world of professional sports is changing quickly, and what we once accepted as true is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the traditional view of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists are exploring what helps players perform their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

This raises questions for fans. For example, would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. This belief may lead them to confuse cause and effect. When a team plays well, the home crowd cheers loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans often remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, forgetting the many times their cheers did not lead to success.

However, there is one common belief among fans that scientific evidence supports. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct their energy towards the referee. In a well-known study, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another version without sound. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team compared to those who watched in silence. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers concluded that referees try to avoid the stress of making calls that would upset the home crowd.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change could be travel. In the past, travel was difficult, but now players travel in great comfort, and if their hotel is not satisfactory, the club will find them a better one. Local conditions used to vary greatly, but now top stadiums are becoming more similar in their efficiency.

Despite these explanations, none fully account for the data. The mystery remains as to why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the greatest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual matchups between the batter and pitcher. Team sports require coordination among teammates. In basketball, success depends on all players working together, which builds confidence when playing at home, regardless of the playing conditions.

Another possibility relates to a more primal aspect of sports. Researchers found that players’ testosterone levels were normal before training and away games, but increased by up to 67% before home games. This territorial instinct may connect to a basic urge to protect their home ground, as seen in recent Rugby World Cup matches. In two notable games, underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing determination and a refusal to be intimidated—characteristics of home advantage. As one referee put it, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’'"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is popular among many dedicated athletes and their coaches. The reason is clear. First, there is debate about who originally said it, with many other golfers from that time being suggested. Second, the meaning is not straightforward. Player did not mean luck in a literal sense; he was being ironic. His true message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ But there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, relates to the nature-nurture debate – whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice. However, it is misleading to call it a debate, as it suggests a fair balance. In reality, the idea that practice is more important than natural talent has gained much support. This view is largely based on the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson, who proposed that anyone can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. His theory has inspired popular books like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, Talent Is Overrated, and Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice. These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor, suggesting that ‘10,000 hours is both necessary and sufficient to make anyone an expert in anything.’ 

However, as Epstein discusses in his engaging book, this is often not the case. He points out a significant flaw in much research on excellence: it usually focuses only on successful individuals. He asks if there are better ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate innate traits from those shaped by environment, support, opportunity, and determination. Epstein travels worldwide, from Kenya to Sweden, and from the Caribbean to the Arctic, even exploring non-human examples. In Alaska, he discovers that the key to success in the toughest sled dog race may be the drive and desire of the husky dogs, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary. This raises the question: can commitment and determination be chosen, or are they influenced by genetics? 

Epstein highlights the complexity of this topic. He differentiates between hardware (nature) and software (nurture), agreeing that both are essential for elite athletes. He does not downplay the importance of training or environment. For instance, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, he also examines cases where genetics play a crucial role that cannot be overlooked. He addresses the important issues of race and gender, asking: ‘If only practice hours matter, why do we separate men and women in sports?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main issue. This idea connects with other discussions about childhood today. A follow-up study interviewed children to understand their feelings better. The children did not express a desire for new technology; many said they would be happier if they could just go outside more. Many adults over 40 often reminisce about their own childhoods, recalling how they spent long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They believe this was healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they are the ones who created these protective environments for their kids, avoiding risks like building forts in old sheds.

Griffiths’ book contains strong arguments. She discusses the fear parents have about dangers in the outside world and how this fear leads to more child-focused consumerism. Parents wanting to keep their children safe often buy toys and gadgets to entertain them at home. She also criticizes trends like prescribing medication for restless children or requiring kids to wear goggles during playground games. While I am unsure how common these rules are, Griffiths expresses her frustration with passion, discussing various aspects of childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules.

Although her arguments are appealing, Griffiths sometimes goes too far. She has a good idea but does not know when to stop, ignoring important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares the treatment of children today to a subtle form of racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths tends to have a romantic view of children. While she acknowledges that children can be mischievous, she mostly presents an idealized view of them that may not match reality. She suggests that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks, believing they need to experience some danger to learn how to manage it. She writes, “Children need accidents,” meaning small accidents that help them avoid bigger ones later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents. Additionally, not all children may want the adventurous life Griffiths admires. What about the shy, cautious children who prefer to stay at home? Perhaps the real issue is that society often forces all children into the same mold, whether by keeping them indoors or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill is not just from my education. Many life problems cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers learned in school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those who have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instinct. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are allowed to. 

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling emotions. Creativity is essential for success in today’s world. We no longer need people who just follow instructions or perform routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce. 

Creative minds are playful minds. Adults we call geniuses are those who keep and develop their childlike creativity throughout their lives. Albert Einstein said that school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He described his innovative work as ""combinatorial play."" He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what that would mean. 

We cannot teach creativity, but we can stifle it through schooling that focuses on fixed questions rather than children’s own inquiries. More importantly, children need to learn to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which are essential for their future. 

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop. If they cannot stop, it is not play. Players understand that to keep the game enjoyable, they must make others happy. This ability to quit makes play a very democratic activity. 

However, school has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework is more, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, adult-led sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. Supervised ""play dates"" have replaced unsupervised play, and adults often feel they must intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. 

These changes have happened slowly but have had a significant impact. They are caused by various social factors, including parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to follow their natural desire to play and explore, so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow direct contact with potential employers, which is a modern way to get noticed compared to the old method of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher risk of making mistakes. 

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to connect with her influential contacts. The executive was offended by the idea of sharing her hard-earned connections with a stranger and not only rejected his request but also sent a sarcastic message that went viral online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she likely regrets her tone, if not her message. However, if this incident encourages young people to think more carefully about their professional use of social media, it may have been beneficial. 

Social media can be a risky tool for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes. Ironically, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of young people for years. In the past, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers, a place to impress others and create a different identity. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. 

When using social media for professional networking, the skills learned as teenagers may not apply. Many young people still act as if being bold and confident is appropriate, but this can backfire. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will impress employers on LinkedIn. It is important to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and young people must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers often come across as too familiar or arrogant in their messages. This reinforces the stereotype of young people as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many are struggling to find jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly introduce yourself and explain what you can offer them, such as doing research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of receiving a positive response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to leave a good impression. Remember, social media can be a powerful tool for making connections, but it requires careful use to avoid negative outcomes."
90,"Text: ""Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show that newspapers are struggling. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by one-third to one-half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of US citizens, down from 45% in 2001. Many people confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. In 1835, a journalist in New York claimed that books and theatre were finished and that newspapers would become the most important source of news. Yet, theatre has survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived even in the age of TV, and cinema has continued to do well against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008. 

Newspapers were once a new form of media, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This was not only because it became practical and affordable to produce timely news for a large audience in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railways, and telegraphs. It was also due to the idea that everything around us is always changing, and we need regular updates – a concept that was foreign in medieval times. Our ancestors saw life as cyclical, marked only by the changing seasons and unpredictable disasters like famine or disease. 

Before the 19th century, journalism as a profession was not well established, and there was no clear need for people to receive news regularly. In some ways, the regular publication of newspapers can be a limitation. Online news allows readers to access information based on their own interests and the urgency of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms help us customize the news we receive. When significant news breaks, online news sources can provide updates almost instantly. There are no space limits that restrict storytelling or analysis, and readers can often access full documents or events mentioned in news articles. This is very different from the constraints of newspaper publishing.

However, many news providers do not seem to recognize the potential of the internet to enhance understanding. Instead, the focus is often on being the first to report news, increasing reader comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In medieval times, news was often shared in busy marketplaces or taverns, where truth competed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be returning to that environment. Newspapers have not always been effective at explaining how the world works. They may be facing extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic world, newspapers will find a way to help us gain wisdom and understanding."""
91,"Text: ""If humans truly belonged under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many night animals do. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genes, even if we don’t think of ourselves as daytime beings, just like we don’t think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This explains what we have done to the night. We have changed the night to suit us by filling it with light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While it has benefits, it also brings problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and rhythms that many life forms, including us, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects some life activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding.

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and there were no public gaslights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. We have illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. Among mammals, the number of night-active species is incredible. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. The effect is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by searchlights or gas flares, circling endlessly until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours because of artificial light.

It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Unlike astronomers, most of us may not need a perfect view of the night sky for our work, but we, like many other creatures, do need darkness. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is as important for our health as light is; changing our internal clock can lead to various health issues. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological reflection of the light changes on Earth. These rhythms are so essential to our existence that disrupting them is like changing our center of gravity. In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. Living in our own created glare, we have disconnected ourselves from our evolutionary and cultural roots – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. In a real way, light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the scale of our existence, which is best understood against the backdrop of a deep night with the Milky Way stretching above us."""
92,"Text: 'The founder of a large international company recently announced that his business would stop tracking employees’ paid vacation time. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. However, this way of announcing the change seems like a superficial attempt to make a potentially unkind policy seem friendlier. 

Is this idea practical? The internet company and the large corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, including finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of “take as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn’t hurt the business” seems more suitable for a smaller company where employees know each other’s workloads better. In a larger company, it is harder to know if taking time off will affect the business or their careers.

The founder has said that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel completely sure that their work and their team are up to date and that their absence won’t harm the business. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a vacation, there will always be more waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works; you pause your work, but it keeps piling up. 

Employees who follow these guidelines might not take any time off at all, or they might feel guilty about taking leave. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers don’t take enough time off, it could reduce their productivity over time. There may also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is away and for how long. This pressure can already influence when people start and finish their workday. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a “no vacation” culture in a place with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. 

If the security and rights that come with statutory leave are taken away, workers might feel they cannot take the time off they need for fear of being seen as lazy. They would lose their legal right to rely on. This policy could create a situation where employees feel unable to take their entitled leave, or they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, making the new policy ineffective. 

Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which has blurred the line between work and personal time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees questioned how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the employer can’t track employees’ work hours accurately, why should they apply a different standard to their time off? 

However, a potential problem with having no set working hours is that all hours could become working hours. Employees may never know if their working hours are being watched by their employer, leading them to self-discipline, which can have negative effects. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid vacation because rest and leisure are essential for their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can exist without considering worker well-being. Therefore, I am skeptical that allowing employees to take as much vacation as they want is either the true goal or the likely result of this policy.'"
93,"Text: 

Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is often seen as a way to ensure the quality of research, as it aims to prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure the trustworthiness of published research? The answer is both yes and no. 

The current state of scientific publishing is changing. While I still believe in the importance of peer review, I see a shift happening. The rise of preprints—drafts of papers shared online without peer review—plays a significant role in this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new findings so that others can read, critique, and build upon them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which has affected both authors and reviewers. The competition for publication in prestigious journals encourages scientists to produce high-quality work, but it also leads to shortcuts, where important data may be omitted. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, the decision can depend more on the paper's relevance or newsworthiness than on its scientific merit.

Despite these known issues, many are reluctant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently suggested, preprints could offer a solution without drastically changing the norm. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they have not been widely adopted. This slow acceptance is partly due to scientists' conservative nature and the misconception that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to the spread of poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.

Preprints may not undergo peer review, but authors understand that they will be open to critique and discussion from a global community of reviewers. For example, psychology professor Tanya Elks shared her experience of critiquing a published paper. In the traditional peer review system, the original authors could block critical papers or complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, both sides could engage in open discussion, allowing readers to assess the quality of the arguments. 

Preprint archives facilitate informal scientific discussions that were once limited to individual correspondence. They can also provide a platform for sharing negative results, which are often overlooked by journals focused on new discoveries. Additionally, having work on preprint archives increases the chances that papers will be read and cited by others, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method of sharing research. By embracing the web's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the research itself, rather than the prestige of the publication."
94,"**Simplified Text:**

When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" However, these answers usually do not satisfy anyone. One day, I asked a group of students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it: one as a scientist would, describing it objectively, and another from the object's perspective, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I am a device that helps people breathe. I am only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The object? An oxygen mask – an unusual choice that helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and interesting discussions.

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand and feel. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes, a poem stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because it is hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we hope to find in poems? Aren’t they places for deep feelings, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp humor? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp criticism, we read online articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music is hard to beat with its mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. However, one thing that poems can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life is full of uncertainty, unlike reading sentence by sentence.

Searching online for ""poem"" leads to ""poetry,"" defined as ""a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language."" This sounds good, but it misses the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is a ""maker of things."" So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – unpredictable and untameable – or to machines – precise and human-made – depending on their views. But these comparisons often break down when examined closely.

The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this debate can change how you think about both. It can help us rethink our usual ways of thinking and see ordinary things in a new way. A poem as a mental object is easy to grasp, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody has power, dating back to schoolyard rhymes like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, right in front of you: A poem can resonate deeply like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten just like an article, story, or novel, but it is not usually created to be sold. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make money. A poem exists not as a product for sale, but for its own sake. Because of its unique status in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"Text: ""I bought my first metal detector shortly after getting married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and I could have used it for something practical for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered brought me joy because it connected me to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again.

One dull February afternoon, I had a few hours to spare and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a nearby spot known for old farming machinery. When my detector beeped for the first time, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't walk away without checking. I dug down half a meter and, lying in the mud, I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, beautifully patterned loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before—the Great Torc in the British Museum, a famous object from Iron Age Britain over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end.

I took it to my car, and on the way home, I kept looking at the torc on the passenger seat. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the only cleaning it had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I called out, ‘I have something for you.’ As I admired my find, I heard my wife enter the room and stop. ‘What is it?’ she asked after a moment. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were worried about damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. Although we had never been robbed, I felt anxious and restless. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath.

The law requires that such finds be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I brought it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, stopped mid-sentence, and authenticated the torc. It was eventually sold to my local council and is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

However, the torc has meant more to me than just a lucky find. I feel like I have saved it for the nation. People often say to me, ‘Now that you’ve found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?’ But the brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing—there’s always the chance of catching an even bigger one tomorrow."""
96,"Text: ""Sleeping is one of my greatest joys when I travel, but I don’t often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I smile and stay quiet. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in cozy Italian beds? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours – over 12 – I spent sleeping each day. There were loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could enjoy a deeper, dream-filled sleep that I never thought possible. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I believe that the quality of sleep while traveling is different for another reason. I think sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we expose ourselves to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. We take in many new things – cultures, music, landscapes, and even different ways of moving. It is during sleep that we process this flood of new experiences. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are traveling. Sleep also changes in rhythm from place to place. People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For instance, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up at dawn to start their day before it gets too hot, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is high, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to adjust to the island’s different sleep and wake patterns. When I finally adapt to the local sleep schedule, I feel like I have truly arrived. I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a large lunch with new Dominican friends in an apartment overlooking the beautiful Caribbean Sea. After eating and feeling hot, our conversation faded and eventually stopped. One by one, my friends left the table to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why my hosts had so many pillows on the floor. I took a couple for myself and followed their lead. I had always heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I truly experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life. Travel sleep has another wonderful quality: I remember it. Being far from my usual sleep routine, I find joy in the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep in a new place. If enjoying every moment of travel, rather than rushing to do everything, is what makes a modern traveler aware, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is, in fact, an important part of the experience."""
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest,"" she asked. Mia picked up a medium-sized hat, soft with a layer of gauze and decorated with a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said diplomatically. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that resembled a bulldog. ""But it’s so boring,"" she replied. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. ""Yes, this is the one I want,"" she decided. 

Mia knew she couldn’t change her mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday it was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing, someone they didn’t know. Her husband, Jeff, had quickly pointed out this mystery when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie? What kind of name is that?"" Jeff had asked. ""It’s short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" ""More like something very pretentious,"" Jeff had said. He didn’t like pretentiousness or beating around the bush, unlike Mia, who hesitated to speak her mind. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and might have said a dustbin lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good.""

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door; her commute took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there’s a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends who struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions that there was definitely a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women traveled from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where she provided a relaxed environment for them to try on as many hats as needed. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry as well."

Lawrence Okoye has traveled a long way from London to Atlanta, where he reflects on his incredible sports journey. Although he is confident, he seems surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly starting a new career in American football. Despite having no prior experience in the sport, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for a major team in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still figuring out what his new role involves.

It is surprising that a 21-year-old newcomer from London could be considered for one of the top teams in American sports. However, Lawrence is known for proving doubters wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on training for the discus instead, having previously played rugby. Within 20 months of starting, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower.

Lawrence initially came to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his unexpected interest in American football, he confirms that it was on his mind, but he only decided to pursue it after arriving in the USA. He had thought about it while in school, but it seemed unrealistic then. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played before, he felt confident enough to apply for the trials. 

When asked if he was nervous about competing against experienced players, he simply says no, as he rarely feels nervous. Although he is not very talkative, he is sure of his abilities. His performance in various tests impressed the coaches, leading to his selection as a standout player. He expressed happiness about this recognition, showing a rare glimpse of pride.

However, he remains cautious. With no basic experience in American football, some may wonder how he can make it onto an NFL team. Lawrence believes he has the necessary qualities, and it all comes down to how hard he works. When asked if he will be relaxed while waiting to hear about his selection, he says he will be, as he feels no pressure. Many people think he will be chosen, but he is not overly concerned.

This calmness may stem from his disappointing experience in the Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He has moved past that moment and is proud of qualifying for the final with a strong last throw. He describes that day as amazing, even though the final did not go as he had hoped. 

After his Olympic disappointment, some speculated that he had let the experience affect him, but Lawrence chooses not to comment on that. The financial rewards for NFL players are significant, with a minimum salary of over $400,000 a year. Lawrence has shifted from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Given his impressive physical abilities, some might suggest he should focus on just one sport. He understands this viewpoint but explains that he is pursuing a dream he has had since childhood. If it does not work out, he can always return to the discus, a sport he loves. He assures that every decision he has made has been well thought out."
99,"Text: 'I had been flying east all night and woke up to find it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, Siberia had not yet changed for autumn. I saw no signs of human life, just a strange mix of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled sleepily. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow, flying to the remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was going to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. “But, Robert,” he argued, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I believed there was a road, though not many people used it now. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to convince him with hand gestures that I had plenty of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget for my trip. Most of my clothes and gear were bought at low prices. In truth, I wasn’t sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers that I bought for £10. 

It all began in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. “OK,” it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I still struggled to control my classes fully, the job met many important needs for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventuring bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: cycle around the world. Since that first ride together, Al had taken on greater challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was certainly his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, proving he could handle each new challenge, even when it seemed impossible. He was showing the skeptics who said he couldn’t do it that they were wrong. He faced something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive.'"
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots compete by flying through tall pylons, which are between 15 and 25 metres high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate. An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was healthy, and the second stated that I would empty my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay oriented throughout the experience. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I was also asked to promise that when flying upside down, I would “completely relax and try to enjoy the view.”

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was instructed not to touch anything. As we began taxiing down the runway, I was nervous. My legs were up, my feet avoided the important steering pedals, and my hands stayed away from the many switches nearby. Despite the instructions, I found it hard to relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying: to survive without fainting, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right moments. Panicking is not a good idea.

As we accelerated down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and just two seconds later, we made a sharp right turn. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air rush out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a brief moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out, turned sharply left, and dived, leaving my stomach behind at 2,000 metres.

Seconds later, we were just 10 metres off the ground, heading for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was interrupted by another sharp turn. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand shook so much that the plane shook too. Then Dario spoke, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he performed a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yup,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. 

I know many people would find this thrilling, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was overwhelming. At the top of the loop, while upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields below. The flight lasted 10 minutes and felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during races. To prove this, Dario pulled out sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about doing loops in the air."
101,"Doug Allan is a filmmaker who captures wild animals in cold regions. If you have seen impressive videos of polar bears in nature documentaries, they were likely filmed by him. He prefers a temperature of -18°C. Allan studied marine biology and worked as a commercial diver, which was his first love and taught him how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew visited Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He ended up guiding the crew to various locations and realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him because it involved travel, adventure, and underwater experiences.

Allan is now a well-known cameraman and has contributed to many important wildlife TV series. He started his career at a time when few people had explored Antarctica. While there were specialists for different animals, he became known as the ""cold man."" He felt that many incredible scenes were waiting to be filmed. When he began 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very basic. He notes that filming is much easier now. In the past, if you recorded something, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot of footage and review it immediately. Filming used to be limited because film was expensive, but now it is easy to have too much material.

Allan believes his experience in cold conditions is valuable. He feels comfortable on sea ice, which now seems as easy as crossing a street to him. Although he sometimes gets cold toes, he finds the polar regions healthy, with no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. He acknowledges that wildlife filming has many successes but also failures and awkward moments. For example, while filming kittiwakes in the Orkneys, he struggled to identify the birds.

Recently, Allan received permission to film in Kong Karls Land, an area in the Arctic Ocean known for polar bears. He knew it would be a challenging task, as the region is dangerous and usually has temperatures around -32°C in April, with strong winds and deep snow making it hard to carry equipment. After spending 23 days walking for hours and observing polar bear dens, he had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on the 24th day, he felt in tune with the bears and their environment. 

He describes a moment when he spotted a bear emerging from a den. He quickly focused his camera and captured the bear as it appeared, followed by two cubs. He felt it was a special moment, as it was likely their first view of the world. Now, Allan hopes to create his own documentary about climate change in the Arctic, speaking with local people who are directly affected by it. He believes he could make a remarkable film."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk alone to the North Pole without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. This time, however, the stakes are much higher. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre trek to the North Pole, where they will measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen understands that the results will be crucial for scientists. This expedition will provide a clearer understanding of how global warming is affecting the polar ice.

Pen was prepared for this kind of work from a young age. His father’s old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, took care of him and toughened him up by sending him out into harsh weather with minimal clothing. His father also inspired a love for adventure in him, and Pen developed remarkable physical endurance. He is married to Mary, a horsewoman who shares his passion for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home than when he is on an expedition. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event, finishing an hour ahead of him. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He admits that it is harder to be away from them this time. When he last left, his son was only one year old, and he mistakenly told him to take care of his mother and sister. This put too much pressure on his son, who constantly checked on them. Because of this, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while in the Arctic, as he believes that calling them will only remind them of how far away he is.

In the days leading up to his departure, Pen is meticulously preparing his equipment. He knows that once he is on the ice, fixing things will be very difficult. He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support crew of six who will fly in supplies. Pen finds being part of a team stressful, and he is also concerned about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained as much as he should have. He often finds that organizing things takes priority over training, which makes him anxious about the challenges ahead.

Pen believes that this mission connects exploration with the quest for knowledge that motivated earlier explorers. He acknowledges that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, the data they collect will benefit scientists, and they aim to engage the public in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He feels that their unique skills, which may seem unusual in everyday life, have become very important and relevant again."
103,"Text: 'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Although I enjoyed these activities, I felt there was nothing competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to compete for the Olympics again. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very interested. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? Probably not. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to enter the race anyway and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which was a lot. We thought we had a better chance than most, but it would still require effort to secure the funds. Additionally, I had to consider the loss of income from being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It’s nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just be discussing my past; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My preparation for the Olympics was tough, with my life focused on getting in the best shape; but looking back, it was quite simple. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training program was clear, and I had doctors and dieticians to help. I was worried about how people would react to me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might seem like I just wanted to be on TV, and I could have chosen a better partner to win the race. However, my worries faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. However, he didn’t know how to row. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more understanding, but I felt it was important to be honest with Ben about the improvements he needed to make. I should have realized that this was his starting point when I agreed to race with him.'"
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job in London to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, vast landscapes, perhaps because I was tired of the noise and crowds of the city. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a position as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow and ice, for trips ranging from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now have over 100. Recently, they acquired a second location called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but warned me that the hours would be long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical. I began packing right away. 

On November 6, while flying to Finland, I stared at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies, trying to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and anxious. Instead, I looked out the window. I remembered that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. However, I felt like winter was moving south, freezing the rivers. 

On November 7, I took a bus north, which was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests of thin conifer trees weighed down by snow, stopping occasionally for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark and was quickly handed a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. Anna asked if I wanted to be thrown in at the deep end, which was a rhetorical question. I followed the sound of barking to the dogsheds, where three people were running back and forth, harnessing the excited huskies to sleds. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy. I stood aside and petted one of the calmer dogs. Someone urged me to get in the sled, and I almost fell in. A command was given, and we took off into the dark, guided only by a headlamp.

By November 15, I was quickly learning how to be a husky guide, but first, I faced a tough questioning about my skills. Anna asked if I was useful, and I was unsure. Further questions revealed that I was not very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. Finally, someone asked if I had a driving license, and I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. However, other tasks were complicated. Simple things like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw—in the snow.'"
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was fast enough to qualify her for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a natural treatment recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman, which helped Radcliffe heal from an injury caused by a bike accident during training. Radcliffe said that the achievement didn’t fully register with her at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a significant moment, but she felt it was just part of her plan for the day. She and her team had decided not to set any limits, following the motto: no limits.

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not be able to maintain her fast pace, fearing she could drop out. Hartmann was upset by this concern, although he understood that someone unfamiliar with her fitness might see it as a risk. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to calculate her finish time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. After running 41 kilometers at a fast pace, she managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, “I can run faster than that.” She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a while, and she thought, “I will come back and do it next year.” Unfortunately, that did not happen.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked closely with Radcliffe, providing daily sessions to help her cope with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, “I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle the level of pain she could. She would push me to my limits.” Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, “Gerard, you’re 15 minutes late, Paula’s waiting.” There was no time for pleasantries; Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour training session. “Paula would push you to your limits, and that’s what made her so successful.” 

Hartmann dedicated so much time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became frustrated. When asked if Radcliffe could explain why no one has come close to her record, she said, “Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner) might do it. Maybe it’s because people are competing against each other instead of focusing on their own performance.” She explained, “That mindset of never easing up, even when you’re winning, probably helped me because I never thought, ‘I can relax now.’ It was always about pushing myself as hard as I could.” Radcliffe did not realize it at the time, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run that fast again, but she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. There was a lot of discussion about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain, and I believed we had created a series that contributed something new to this movement. However, I worried whether people would appreciate a cooking style that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science. I watched the first episode feeling both excited and anxious. Fortunately, the show was successful, leading to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I later wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each linked to its own TV show. In these, the journey was often physical, involving travel and exploration. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet remarkable artisans, like a man who dedicates his life to making the best pasta. These artisans have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. 

Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to feature in the series was challenging, and I knew I would disappoint some people by not including their favorites. I could imagine viewers asking, ‘Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ After a long meeting, the production team and I finally created a list that would satisfy most people. This experience reinforced my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, shaped by personal emotions, memories, and experiences. Despite the book’s title, I never claimed the recipes were ‘definitive’. I believed that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. 

The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. It’s about trying ideas and refining them until something unique emerges. The TV series allowed me to explore various foods, people, and places I had never seen before, and I was excited to connect food with memory and nostalgia, as I began my career in a similar way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, such as visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which forced us to stop filming. While perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get my oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza.'"
107,"Text: 'We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking like he knew what he was doing. “Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,” he finally admitted, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field went on for miles, filled with grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, wanting to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything they talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind; they waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was a little away from the road, not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it got dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on solid ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home now that our van had to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.'"

One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city whose name Lucy didn’t quite catch. They were both about ten years older than her and spoke good English. They discussed the music they were playing and their recent travels. Lucy mentioned, “I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer.” It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which selected only fifteen pianists her age from thousands of applicants. She had made it, and her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate. Her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mother had filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to give her the chance to say no. Back then, she believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in, seeming surprised. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He exchanged a look with the girl, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag; it was hard to know when she was sharing her achievements or showing off. “It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying...” The girl then looked across the room, as if she saw someone she needed to talk to, and left. The guy stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, shaggy hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool even if they loved music. “Once, when I was about eight.” He started to respond when Lucy's grandfather appeared beside her. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition.” “Everyone is the competition.” 

Her grandfather took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” She liked that. Being recognized. Even if it meant some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she received. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids she had gone to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov piece perfectly. But in places like this, she felt she mattered.'"
109,"Text: ""‘Spending too much time online isn’t good for you. You should spend more time in the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about this topic – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is now a key part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do – they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where today’s parents used to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. He believes it helps teenagers form their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues and interact with their peers. 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time for figuring out who you are. Social networking can help with this: you can share your favorite music or sports, find out what you enjoy, and see that others have different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can be helpful for shy people: ‘Talking online can be easier than in person, and it allows you to practice social skills in a less stressful way.’ 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet individuals with specific interests connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of similar people, you can feel more connected and popular in a different way,’ he says. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘Young people who find new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals, and create their own content are truly making the most of social networks.’ She believes social networking is becoming a creative outlet: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity, allowing photographers to connect, learn, share images, and deepen their skills. ‘This all helps with job prospects and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and build brand awareness – understanding how it works is essential. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they could all be potential customers. Linking those networks together creates your customer base.’ 

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create and share content. Collaboration is a vital skill in the 21st century and important for being employable in a digital world.’"""
110,"Text: 'When people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first idea that comes to mind. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet getaway when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he thought was the ultimate family bonding experience. “Not enough people do this anymore,” he and my mother said repeatedly before our trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, “There are probably good reasons for that!” 

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a variety of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks, although I had some coping strategies ready. With barely enough space left for us, we began our ‘Family Great American Road Trip’. Leaving our spacious home for much smaller places for the next five thousand miles, I wasn’t the only one wondering what we had gotten ourselves into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road! The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. I noticed a pattern: desert landscapes changed to mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town hinted at what we would experience later. 

At one point, as we climbed to our next stop, we realized that roads marked for Jeeps were best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we went, we saw a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. Disappointment turned to laughter when we took pictures by the huge “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sun set over bear habitats near the roads. ‘Bear jams’, where park volunteers helped manage traffic to let bears cross, were common. Our close encounter with a bear on the road (and a nervous park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories.

As we drove on, life back home faded away, and even the hotel we stayed in, with its problems, couldn’t dampen our excitement. It was an old, creaky building with no internet or cell phone service, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, we began our journey back south. My parents were right: you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something special. It was a bit sad to be home again, but at least I hadn’t argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our adventure to look through and remember. I knew that the moments I would cherish most were the unexpected and spontaneous ones.'"
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so she would live under the care of the college Head. She was happy to have the best room at the college, which had its own kitchen and study area, along with free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. 

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had vague memories of Daisy from past holidays and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was eager to reconnect with Rose. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents had issues with her grandmother, but there had been a disagreement in the past, leading to Rose spending summers away from Daisy. The last time Rose saw her grandmother, she was only ten, but she remembered those times fondly. 

Dahlia mentioned that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and had a talent for bringing people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not a typical frail old lady; she seemed to attend more social events than many people. 

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She understood healthy eating, fitness, and the importance of sleep. However, she wanted one thing: her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She believed she could be trusted with these small freedoms. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or curfews, and she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood.

Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, which made Rose very happy. They all agreed that it would be about trust from now on. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it again.

Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her a lot. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years of school. For Rose, it was a new chapter in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed challenging, and she wasn’t aware of what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. Recently, she told her former teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. The teacher had thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40, but Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to pursue something she was good at.

On a winter afternoon, I am in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. I knew I would be interviewing a 15-year-old girl about her book, but I was still surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a significant achievement: the story is confident and exciting. Nothing about it, except for the age of the main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support, but she doesn’t. She is independent, lively, and intelligent, but also calm, which keeps her from being overly confident. Charlotte recognizes the limits of her youth. When I ask her about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She laughs and adds, “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t see myself as particularly wise. I was just interested in the theme of taking responsibility.”

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often misrepresented in fiction. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the socially awkward teenager. Reading about these character types frustrated her. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who aren’t flawed in some way. Some writers unintentionally give the impression that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience, and that can hurt their self-confidence.”

Charlotte has always enjoyed reading famous fantasy authors, but their works almost discouraged her from writing. “My favorite fantasy authors explore deep psychological and life themes. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I was capable of that.” However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which advises that if readers start to guess what will happen, the suspense is likely gone.

Some might argue that Charlotte’s parents, both journalists, played a key role in getting her novel published. Her father’s connection in publishing helped get her book read initially. She recognizes her good luck, as it is challenging for anyone to get a first novel read, regardless of age. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you’re on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp quickly and flew into the air, arms flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, losing both skis, and flipped into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ 

I wondered if I was suited for freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I had enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I felt I would be ridiculed if I tried to join them. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. It had a large indoor facility with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, where students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits – not a realistic start for what awaited us on the slopes. 

After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their moves for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan cheerfully promised. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope steepens for landing. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which reduces impact. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important.

At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain’s fear and race towards the jump. My legs seemed to go backward as I neared the launch point, and I landed hard on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. 

Day two began on the trampolines. I thought I would dislike being indoors, looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some drills mimicked ski-jumping moves, while others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – understanding what your body is doing while spinning in the air. Gareth provided commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off and then found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.

We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more challenges before I finally landed correctly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving my goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I forced myself to keep my speed up as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly in the landing zone. Then I noticed both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Text: 'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your palms are sweaty with fear, and your nails grip the harness tightly. Suddenly, the ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There is a pause, then a sudden drop that makes your stomach feel weightless. With your teeth clenched, you rush forward, turn sharply left, and then go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you let out a scream of fear. But you have only yourself to blame: like millions of others each year, you chose to pay to enter the theme park. 

What surprises me is that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides designed to attract crowds, are a massive industry. To create the excitement and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers, designers, and marketing experts working behind the scenes. The idea of being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it is actually quite challenging. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while ensuring that riders are safe. They also need to introduce new features to keep visitors interested. 

While many people think that rollercoasters have become more intense over time, most of the techniques used today, like the wheels that allow rides to go upside down, were developed by US designer John Miller in the early 20th century. During his time, there were fewer safety regulations, and many extreme rides were created, often to the discomfort of riders. Now, designers must work within the limits set by specialized ride manufacturers.

I spoke to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer' with a background in aeronautics, explained that the skill lies in putting all the elements together. Dr. John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, added that it involves quickly alternating between feelings of excitement and safety, so riders feel thrilled but not unsafe. 

To create an outstanding ride, the teams behind rollercoasters must develop a strong story, whether it’s a space adventure or a fast-paced jungle chase, that complements any new features like the tallest drops or most twists. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, intuition, experience, and trial-and-error are crucial. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that it helps to be passionate about thrills to understand what riders want and to test the rides before they open.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would need to adopt new technologies, like virtual reality, as other industries have. Walker responded that while virtual reality can enhance the experience, it is similar to how older rollercoasters were beautifully painted. He believes that while new technology is exciting and parks quickly adopt it, the physical experience of the coaster will remain the most important aspect for many years.'"
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both. She explains, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the instructions of demanding choreographers, which can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers sometimes forget what it’s like to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, she takes on a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. “Beginners are often open to new ideas. In some ways, it’s easier to work with them than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They are eager for success but don’t yet fully understand their strengths and weaknesses. This lack of a complete picture makes them more open to criticism. However, they might still question my advice, and I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, letting the music guide her. “There might be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I won’t go back and choose a new piece. Ideally, I’d like to experiment more and switch to different pieces, which would help improve the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I often work on large productions where the music is already decided and cannot be changed.”

Miranda believes in making connections with new people. “It’s important to meet new contacts. However, I must remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my approach each time I go somewhere new, rather than just repeat what I’ve done before. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

We discuss a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,” Miranda says. “This one tries to show an accurate picture of life in a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer receives many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that struggle. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch but very real. The public often underestimates the work and dedication required in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. “It’s when everything the company has worked on – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to expect, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help you overlook a few mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps were excellent, but something about the costumes or props was distracting, which is disappointing.”

Given her wide range of work, I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? “People like to label you, and I don’t quite understand that. There’s a trend to focus on developing expertise in a narrow area, but I don’t follow that. Maybe one day I’ll be happy to be known for one thing, but for now, I want to broaden my horizons.”"
116,"Text: ""A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that there are amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film encouraging people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main focus of the film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and attached them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I placed my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to keep going. I have done many walking trips in recent years, but this was different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads, which allowed me to stop at cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."""
117,"Text: 'When I read about guided swimming trips around small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked confused, he smiled and let me on board. Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first proper swim of 1.5 km, which made me nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own. The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the scenery. As the swims got longer, my speed and enjoyment increased. I felt less need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come back next year.'"

I work with wonderful people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting, which makes it a great job for someone young like me! 

As a child, I attended a boarding school far from my family, so I often flew alone at the beginning and end of each term. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed with me when I decided to leave my banking job and look for a new career. 

At the interview for the flight attendant position, there were many other young people, many of whom were also changing careers. I prepared well for the interview, focusing on my strengths and past work experience, rather than just saying I loved to travel like everyone else. This approach helped me get the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because it has many benefits, although the free flights are not the most important. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: 'no one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family; even if we don’t see each other often, we are still close. When I am not working, I can leave my work behind. If I do encounter difficult passengers, which is rare, I remind myself that the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"""
119,"Text: ""At the summer camp where I work, I enjoy watching the children achieve things they never thought they could. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some children feel nervous at first, but with encouragement, they agree to try, and eventually, they all reach the top. This makes them feel proud. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home. Interestingly, it is often the ten- to thirteen-year-olds who feel this way the most, not the younger ones. We limit their mobile phone use. We tell them they can call home after lunch, but when they ask again after dinner, we say it’s too late and suggest they call the next day. Most children adjust within a couple of days, and by the end of their stay, they thank us for a wonderful time.

It's not just the children who feel lonely; some parents call frequently to check on their child, which is often unnecessary. Their child is usually busy playing games or doing other activities, so we ask the parents to call back later. We also notice a certain type of child who comes dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into more suitable attire, but soon they understand why it's important."""
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors must also be skilled musicians. It opened in London last year after five successful years in the USA, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was challenging. The UK has stricter rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. This meant that twice as many actors were needed in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors based in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The London theatre is larger than the venue in the USA, and it has been full every night, with audiences eager to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are, mentioning, ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

When I asked about his classmates, he said, ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’ When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to join him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was relieved that the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 

Although the young actors were already musicians, with some playing multiple instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year and is definitely worth seeing.'"
