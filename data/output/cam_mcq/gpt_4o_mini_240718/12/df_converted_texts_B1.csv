Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts that show where you are. The website warned that when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are, including some you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. 

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience, which can lead to fame or wealth. However, we often share too much and later realize it can be risky. This can feel sad, but we should not lose hope. There are lessons from people who used the internet before us. 

In the early days of the web, a young man named Justin Hall started sharing his life online in 1994. He created a blog where he wrote about everything, and many people read it. Hall was open about his life, but one day, he had to take down his blog because someone he loved did not want him to share their relationship online. He felt that sharing so much made people not trust him. 

In 2002, another woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, including some she had made fun of. This caused her to lose her job. 

Experts say this is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and if we forget this, we can make big mistakes. 

Heather's story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is successful as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps support her family. She learned that while the internet lets us say anything, we should think carefully before we share."

Some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we do not understand. How can any scientist argue with that? Scientists can sometimes be a bit arrogant, but even the most confident physicist would not say they know everything about the universe. Still, some scientists felt they needed to warn the public about the film, calling it things like ‘atrocious’ and ‘very dangerous’. This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I did not understand why there was so much excitement about it. Various scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. However, when the film talked about some of these discoveries, I began to understand the excitement. One discovery was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people around it. But the movie only showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being talked to by happy people and ugly after being exposed to angry people. 

Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is clear and easy to understand. However, scientists usually respond with skepticism. They want more proof. The idea that water can be affected by thoughts is amazing, but we need solid evidence to believe it. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. 

The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that is causing the universe to expand. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories around the world. 

There are real discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy’. Other discoveries are also surprising. Neuroscientists found that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they actually occur. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even think there are connections between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Despite what some people might say, science is not finished. In fact, we seem to know less than we thought. Many natural events may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the best theoretical physicists are trying to create a Theory of Everything, which would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. 

In the end, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."

Both are important to me and create a beautiful picture. The trees in the forest provide shade, and the wind makes the leaves move, sometimes turning them bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. After I complete a group of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel again. I never write short stories while I’m writing a novel, and I don’t write a novel when I’m working on short stories. Writing these two types may use different parts of my brain, and it takes time to change from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn’t know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but I found it a memorable experience. I felt my fictional world grow, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first collection called Tales from Abroad. This was how I started as a short-story writer.

One of the best things about writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to write a short story (but I can revise it many times). It’s not like the long time and effort needed to write a novel, which can take a year or two. I go into a room, finish my work, and leave. Writing a novel can feel very long, and sometimes I wonder if I will finish it. So, writing short stories gives me a nice change.

Another good thing about short stories is that you can create a story from small ideas – a thought, a word, or an image. It’s often like jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a perfect story every time. This makes me feel better. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from what works and what doesn’t in my short stories. In this way, short stories are like a practice space for me as a novelist. It is hard to try new things in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder for me. My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, and I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like signs to my heart, and I am happy to share these feelings with my readers."""

Science is a way of understanding the world. It can help us cure diseases and make our lives easier, but it can also create problems. Science tries to explain everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe. It has influenced many areas of life, including art and politics. Sometimes, people do not understand how important science is, and they may either overestimate or underestimate its value. Scientists often disagree with each other, and new ideas can change what we believe. 

This book will focus on important scientific ideas that have changed how we think. While science has practical uses, we will mainly look at its ideas and their beauty. We will also remember that science can be limited and that scientists can make mistakes. Science is always changing. There is always a scientist who is proving another scientist wrong. Most of the time, these changes do not affect society much. However, sometimes, new ideas can change our beliefs completely.

For example, in the 1600s, scientists thought the universe worked like a giant clock. But later, new discoveries changed this view. Some people think that the changing nature of science means it cannot explain the universe well. However, when science changes, it often helps us understand and predict nature better. For instance, Isaac Newton explained more about the universe than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton.

Science has made many discoveries in the last two centuries, such as radioactivity, X-rays, and the electron. Today, some people believe we are close to finding a complete theory that explains everything about the universe. Science is not just a fun activity; it has real effects on our lives. We have moved from just observing nature to controlling it in some ways. This can sometimes upset the balance of nature, and we need to be careful.

Everyone should understand science because it affects our future and the world our children will live in. The decisions made in science can impact health, the economy, and even the future of life on Earth."

Since around 2015, many big publishers have noticed that ebook sales have stopped growing and, in some cases, have even gone down. This has raised questions about the future of ebooks in the publishing world. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks may have led to bad investments, making his company lose faith in the value of printed books. Even though it seems clear that ebooks and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea is interesting and causes a lot of discussions. 

Why do we think of ebooks and print books as being in competition? The answers to these questions go beyond just ebooks and show how we feel about change and new technology. In my research, I found that people often worry that new technologies will replace older ones. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. But radio found new ways to be used, like listening in cars or at work. 

The idea that books might disappear is not new. In 1894, some people thought that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This has happened many times with movies, radio, and smartphones, which have all been said to threaten print books. Some people believe that if books disappear, it will be bad for culture. Others think that ebooks will bring great benefits. 

The idea of books disappearing often comes up when new technology is introduced. This idea shows our mixed feelings about change. We form strong emotional connections with different media, like books and computers. Studies show that we can even name our cars or get upset when our laptops don’t work. So, when new technology, like e-readers, appears, it changes our relationship with things we have always used. 

As technology changes, we often miss what we used to have. This is why some people still enjoy older products. For example, when the printing press was invented in the 15th century, people wanted original manuscripts. When movies changed from silent to sound in the 1920s, people felt nostalgic for silent films. The same thing happened when photography changed from analog to digital and when vinyl records changed to CDs. 

E-readers have made many people appreciate the physical qualities of printed books, even their smell. This should make those who worry about print books feel a bit better. However, the idea that books might disappear will continue to be a popular story about how technology changes our lives and how we feel about that change. We often use familiar stories, like those about tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing things that are important to us."

For a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday morning. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time. I wanted to understand how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By writing about the everyday details of their lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to show a different side of their personalities and careers. 

The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I believe, “Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.” This book is not just about the final work of these people; it is about their daily routines. I also share my own struggles: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus on one project or to work a little each day? When there is not enough time, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time?

I do not have all the answers, but I have tried to show how many successful people faced similar challenges. I wanted to explain how big creative ideas can be broken down into small daily tasks and how our habits can affect our work. The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but it is really about people’s routines. A routine can seem boring, but it can also help us use our time, energy, and optimism better. 

The psychologist William James believed that having good habits can help us focus on more interesting things. Ironically, he was often a procrastinator and struggled to keep a regular schedule. My own idea for this book came from a moment of procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, I was at my job at a small architecture magazine, trying to write a story that was due the next day. Instead of working, I was cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a “morning person,” so I decided to look online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them. This led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was simple; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I have gathered more detailed and researched information while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog interesting. I have let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to thank the many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work helped me. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for those who want to read more."

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, said that their planned holiday to Spain was not possible anymore. Instead, they rented a small house on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had wanted to be a palaeontologist for a long time. By the end of his time at university, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was not interested in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. Instead, he was fascinated by the very beginning of life on Earth and studied small creatures found in grey rocks.

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would get a job. He felt confident about his abilities, but he knew that sometimes, good people do not get the jobs they deserve. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied right away, but he did not have high hopes.

On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car, and went to the hospital. The interview happened without him. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, took his place on the panel. This professor helped Howard get the job, even though Howard did not know him. At first, Howard was very grateful, but later a colleague explained that it was not because of his skills. Howard felt a little disappointed but was mostly happy to have the job and do the work he loved.

Howard often thought about how organized his work life was, where he could plan and follow through on his research. In contrast, his personal life was chaotic. Sometimes, unexpected things could change everything. For example, his briefcase with his lecture notes was stolen at a train station. Angry, Howard went back to the college, called to explain, and postponed his lecture. He reported the theft and then went for a coffee. There, he met a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This could be a great opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."

Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University in the UK, and he is very open to trying new foods. He even has ice cream made from bee larvae at home! Although they look like maggots, they taste a bit nutty and floral. Spence and his team are working on how to make eating bugs more acceptable. He studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. This research affects what we eat and drink, from big food companies to popular restaurants.

Spence's book, The Perfect Meal, co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, shares interesting facts about food. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal more? Also, we eat about 35% more food when we are with one other person, and 75% more when we are with three people.

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and not very modern. He has soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with chefs who cannot pay for research. Much of his work is supported by a large food company. In the past, some people thought that research funded by companies was not real science. However, now it is important for universities to show that their work matters to people.

Spence helps food brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. It is important for these companies to keep their customers healthy. Many brands make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice the difference. Spence explains that when people know about the changes, they focus on the taste and often do not like it as much.

Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a food company. At first, people thought mixing science and food was strange, but Spence and Blumenthal worked together to create a dish called ""Sound of the Sea."" Spence has found that music can change how we taste food. For example, high-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. Soon, an airline will match music with the food they serve to passengers.

Spence's dinner parties are unique. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled light bulbs. They have even had dinner parties with headphones and different drinks to see how sound affects taste. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food events, and conferences are all part of his research."

Our brains are working harder than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false information, and rumors that we need to sort through to find what is important. At the same time, we are doing more things ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights and salespeople helped us find items in stores. Now, we do most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage many responsibilities, like our jobs, families, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. These devices help us fill every free moment with activities.

However, there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, or doing many things at once, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, it costs us mental energy. Instead of being like expert jugglers, we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another and worrying about what we might drop.

Even though we believe we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It can increase stress hormones in our bodies, which can make us feel confused or foggy. Multitasking can also create a craving for constant stimulation, making it hard to focus. The part of our brain that helps us stay focused can easily be distracted by new things, like shiny objects that catch our attention.

Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. He showed that the mental losses from multitasking are worse than those from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning new information while multitasking can send that information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information may not be stored properly, making it harder to remember later.

Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to answer a text message or ignore it. Making decisions is hard for our brains, and small decisions can use as much mental energy as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can end up making poor choices about important matters.

In discussions about information overload, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not that email itself is bad, but the huge amount of messages we receive can be overwhelming. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does, he said, ""He answers emails."" His father agreed that this was quite true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it often feels impossible to do that and complete other tasks."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right way to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought these questions were not important. Animals had behaviors, and science only looked at the results of those behaviors. The idea that animals have feelings and thoughts was seen as silly. But this has started to change. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to show that animals have emotions. This new understanding has appeared in popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s *Wild Justice* and Victoria Braithwaite’s *Do Fish Feel Pain?* This has started a debate that may never be fully answered: do animals have consciousness? This debate leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong that guides their behavior? 

In a recent experiment with cows, researchers found that cows that opened a locked gate to get food were happier than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we raise and eat beef? While the observations are clear, people disagree on what they mean. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote *Second Nature*, believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks we are close to a big change in how we think about ethics, similar to when slavery was abolished. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should rethink how we understand animal thinking. He says animals likely have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop thinking of animals as if they are just like us. 

These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. It is very hard to define consciousness. Can we ever really know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an important experiment he did that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with plenty of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. But when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life. 

Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a strong opinion. He says, “We look back with disgust at a time when there was racism. One day, we will feel the same about how we view animals. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar ideas. Manning has written a textbook called *An Introduction to Animal Behaviour*. He says, “What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. In the early 20th century, some people thought animals thought just like us, and then there was a reaction against that. Now we are moving back to the idea that animals have thoughts and feelings. But this is a complicated topic, and we should be careful about listening to academics with strong personal opinions.”"

Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., believes that arguing can help us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it also changes how we solve complex problems and makes it harder to think clearly. West says we are often exposed to poor thinking and popular opinions that can confuse us. Even though we have more information than ever, it does not always lead to better knowledge or decisions. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading books, and this decline is getting faster. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, thinks that focusing more on visual media, like videos and games, may hurt our critical thinking skills. She says people are multitasking and not concentrating on one thing. However, we still do not have a clear answer about how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology has changed how we think, and it can have both positive and negative effects. For example, some computer games can help improve critical thinking, while browsing the internet can distract us from deeper thinking. Greenfield has studied how visual media affect learning. She explains that reading helps us think and use our imagination better than visual media like video games and TV. Reading develops our imagination, reflection, and vocabulary. However, she also found that some visual media can help with processing information. Unfortunately, many visual media do not give us time to think or reflect.

This situation means that many young people may not reach their full potential. How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. There is a debate about video games and their impact on learning. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, says that video games can be good for kids. They are not just entertainment; they can also be useful for learning. Research shows that playing games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in fun, virtual environments that are similar to the real world. These games allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life. 

In today’s digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to look more closely at technology and understand how it affects our thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after he became unhappy with working in an office and for social policy organizations. His first book was about the good things about manual work. His latest book talks about how to deal with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he was shopping and saw advertisements on the credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. Crawford realized that it is becoming harder to avoid these distractions. What we want to think about at any moment is personal, but we often cannot choose this for ourselves because of things we do not notice. It is getting more difficult to think or remember conversations we have had. Because everyone wants to avoid being interrupted, we often stop talking to strangers. Crawford says, “We see the world through things that are made for us, like video games and apps on our phones.” These things reflect our desires and can take over our lives. 

Crawford is not the only one who is worried. Many office workers complain about emails all day and then spend their free time checking emails. Studies show that our attention can wander if a phone is just sitting on the table. Many of us have felt bored at dinner, wanting to check our phones. There is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, but people have worried about this since the telegraph was invented in 1837. It is clear that we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Some people think this problem is caused by technology, but Crawford believes that technology has made it easier for us to focus on ourselves. 

Having many choices makes it hard for us to control ourselves, and this affects our social lives. We often prefer to send a text message to a friend instead of talking to them. Crawford argues that by only interacting with representations of people, like through screens, we might lose something important in our society. He uses his gym as an example. There used to be one music player in the middle of the room for everyone to use. People had different music tastes, which could cause some tension. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds. “The gym used to be a social place, but it has lost that feeling,” he says. Real connections with others often happen when there is some conflict, like discussing different music tastes.

Crawford has two suggestions to help with this problem. First, we need to control noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he believes we should practice skills that help us engage with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives examples of a cook, an ice hockey player, and a motorcycle racer. These people must deal with real things in their work. No video game can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under your tires when you ride fast. Each of these roles requires good judgment and the ability to work with others in the same space. “When you engage with the world this way, fake experiences show themselves as weak compared to real experiences,” he says. “They lose some of their power.” 

This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to find ways to use your judgment. There are many benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and makes it harder to focus on what is important. On the other hand, paying attention to one thing makes it easier to pay attention to other things."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher like me, it can be a bit tricky to answer. Saying you are a philosopher can sound a bit showy. It is better to say you study or teach philosophy. Many people think that being a philosopher means you know some special truth, but that is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else.

One reason people think this way is that philosophers often judge what others do and celebrate thinking. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of thinking was the best kind of life. While not all modern philosophers agree, philosophy is still seen as connected to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" This means that just going along with what everyone else thinks is not very satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not mean you have to read many difficult philosophical books or spend all your time thinking. It just means paying more attention to the everyday experiences that shape our lives. You do not have to be a wise person living away from society to do this. In fact, examining our lives can be very practical and should be shared with others because it is important for a good life.

Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more separate from real life, especially for those who do not have formal training. This is not only the philosophers' fault; universities often focus on expensive academic journals, making it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. Because of this, philosophy can seem very distant from everyday life. While some philosophers used to challenge this view, many have accepted it. The academic world has created a situation where philosophers are often isolated from society.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I work in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully describe my work because ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. There is a new way of thinking in ethics that looks at whether certain social practices are fair or just. The job of an ethicist today is to decide if something is ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I think about often.

A typical discussion might start by asking if downloading movies illegally is wrong (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and how consumerism affects us. Philosophy can help people think more deeply about the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we might find out something we already knew; other times, we may realize that our beliefs are hard to defend. By examining these ideas, we can do something good for everyone."

People who love food, like foodies and chefs, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, discussions about food have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers talk about eating, they usually use it as a way to discuss something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, conversations about food seem to be about food, but they often explore deeper ideas that are not directly related.

One interesting philosopher is Epicurus, who believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. His name is now often connected with enjoying food and drink. You can see his name in restaurants and food shops because these businesses hope to attract customers by linking their products to a famous philosopher.

Food is also social and cultural. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities help us grow and share food. We interact with food more than with any other product, making it a good topic for philosophical discussion. After food is prepared, critics start to talk and write about it. But why do these critics have such a special role? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, good food critics are just better at describing what food tastes like. This area of taste has not been studied much, as most research has focused on how we see things.

Another important part of food is its beauty. We often talk about paintings or music being beautiful, but we don’t usually talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, because of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed as art, like sculpture or poetry. However, food is eaten and gone after we enjoy it, unlike art that can last over time. So, it is not correct to think of food as a true art form.

There are also many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our answers often show our beliefs about what is right or wrong. Philosophers will always question why we choose what we do, and discussing these ideas about food is important.

Cooking at home and in restaurants can be very different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone shares food and time together. But professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more like colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and eating can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we can learn to appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food; second, we can build friendships with people from other cultures by sharing meals. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy come alive for readers."

Rob Daviau is from the US and he designs special board games called ‘legacy’ games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. This made him think about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a story and if choices made in one game could affect the next game. 

He took a classic board game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made by players during the game have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, change the board, or open new packets with different rules at important moments. The games are played over several sessions, and players can hold grudges against each other. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Later, he worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very successful, SeaFall was seen as a big test for the legacy format because it was the first game that did not come from an earlier version. In SeaFall, players become sailors in the 16th to 19th century and explore a new world.

Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make to keep the story interesting. They use play-testers to see how the games work. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. At first, the game is great, but after a few games, it can start to break. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy games were not expected to be very popular. Daviau thought it would only be interesting to a small group of people. He said, “I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the best improvements in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment and excitement.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the fun of a new adventure was more important than worrying about how long the game would last. He mentioned that people don’t usually watch the same movie twice in the cinema. “You’re buying into an experience,” he said. The legacy format is inspired by video games and popular TV shows. 

While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and game design. He still loves telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared making legacy games to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and where you want it to begin, but you also need more than just a basic plan.”

Daviau feels proud of his work but is curious to see how others will use the idea. He thinks that soon gamers will want something new. Colby Dauch, the studio manager for SeaFall’s publisher, believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."

Not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared a lot online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think that animals are similar to us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart and look very different from humans. 

Octopuses can do amazing things like open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play games. Some scientists believe that we often ignore the smart traits of animals. Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, says that we should recognize these traits instead of denying them. He has studied animal intelligence for many years and found that animals can think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand what others want. This means animals are smarter than we usually think.

In the past, people believed that animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world, said that the difference between human and animal minds is just a matter of degree, not kind. However, in the twentieth century, many people started to see animals as simple machines that only respond to rewards and punishments. This view became popular at the same time that humans were harming animal habitats and not caring for animals properly.

Now, Dr. de Waal believes we are starting to understand animal intelligence better. He says that we are learning that animal thinking is similar to human thinking, even if it is not the same. He mentions that the best tests for animal intelligence should consider what each species is good at. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts.

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we fail, the octopus might think we are not very smart. 

Dr. de Waal is not completely sure that Inky really found his way to the ocean. He knows that other octopuses have escaped before, but it might be too hopeful to think Inky knew how to do it. He also understands that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate animal intelligence. 

He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they could feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers (which they like) and others got grapes (which they like even more), the monkeys with cucumbers got very upset. This study was published in a scientific journal, but what really made people believe it was a short video of the experiment released later. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways."

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now changing our world in a big way. Robots have been used in car and factory work for many years, but experts say we are about to see robots used in many more areas. Many people think that robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows that people feel their jobs are safe, but they might not be. Every job sector will be affected by robots in the coming years.

For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is a robot called Tally, made by a startup in San Francisco. Tally moves around supermarkets to check that products are in the right place and priced correctly, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robots say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means new jobs will be created for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, some people worry that we should not forget the importance of human skills at work. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come when human interaction is less valued.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing jobs. His recent report says that in two years, about one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work with other robots and humans safely. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will still be open because there are not enough skilled workers.

Zhang believes that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He thinks these workers should not wait for the government to protect their jobs but should find ways to learn new skills. People cannot expect to do the same job for their whole lives anymore.

New technologies will also create a new type of robots for consumers, like robots that can walk and live in our homes and interact with us in smart ways. This is a big chance for companies that can take advantage of these changes. However, it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy. With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis coming, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce with robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is known for saying he wanted to climb Mount Everest ""because it’s there."" This answer shows a common question people have: why do climbers take such big risks? Some people might feel inspired by his answer to follow their own dreams. Climbing can be about adventure and fun, not just reaching the top of a mountain.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different types of climbing activities, from playing on small rocks to climbing high mountains. Each type has its own rules, and the way climbers choose to climb depends on these rules. This idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in magazines and conversations.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also feel very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a contradiction in climbing. But some argue that having fewer choices can actually make life simpler and give a different kind of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is part of our nature. It is in our genes to take on challenges, even if they are risky. The joy we find in climbing is more about our biology than just thinking logically.

Another important idea comes from US academic Brian Treanor. He says that climbing can help us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these qualities, Treanor believes they are especially important in today’s world.

Some climbers think that those who climb without help from others or technology must be very dedicated to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by saying that climbing alone is harder and deserves more recognition than climbing with a team or using tools like bottled oxygen. However, this idea might encourage some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Climbing can also be understood outside of Western ideas. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""going with the flow."" The physical effort, the focus needed while climbing, and the problem-solving involved are all key parts of the experience. Some believe that climbing is similar to Zen philosophy, which teaches how to calm the mind and find peace. This idea adds another layer to understanding why people are drawn to climbing."

For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel was very important in classical music. He was a serious person who studied and recorded many famous European piano works. He wrote and performed a lot, but he did not teach many students. People who knew him saw a fun side to him, but he rarely showed it during his concerts. His life was a busy mix of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked him for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He remembered a famous pianist who said, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, Brendel was impressed by Kit, who was about 14 years old. He listened to Kit play and said, “He played very well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a recital he had done, and it was so beautiful that I thought, ‘I have to make time for him.’ It is rare to find a musician who understands music so well.”

As Brendel steps back from performing, Kit is starting to become more known. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother watches over him. He also composes music. Brendel says, “This is very important. Learning to read music is easier when you try to write your own. I noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and can read music very well. He listens to his own playing and understands what I explain to him. When I tell him something to do in one part of a piece, he can do it in other parts too.”

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the great pianist of the 21st century. He thinks this is harmful. He knows that gifted young musicians can play some things very well, but they still need time and experience to improve in other areas. It can be harmful if a critic expects too much.

Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed in his life after performing. He says, “When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by the time I was 50. When I turned 50, I felt I had done most of those things, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Even though I don’t have the same physical strength now, I still have many ideas in my mind and pieces I have never played. I don’t perform now, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.”"

When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My Grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic covering broken glass.

At home, my father was often quiet. He had a sense of humor and liked to say funny phrases, like “It’s immaterial to me.” He didn’t finish school and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he once thought about moving to Canada with my mother, but it didn’t happen. He was good at fixing things around the house, like bookshelves and cupboards. My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing the furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, she would bring in another. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I never got to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I couldn’t play, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Of the places to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could imagine a different world there. With a fishing net and old sandals, I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and have a picnic. I would try to catch fish, but after failing to keep them alive in the yard, I would return them to the water.

I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed impossible until one day my father said, “There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.” In that moment, he surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think he saw my interest in gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening himself, I believe he noticed my passion for plants and flowers."

Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. A strong wind is blowing, and it feels like we might be blown off the cliff and into the ocean below. But Lawrence’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and Lawrence gently pets him. Even with the strong wind, Lawrence feels comfortable on his island. 

Lawrence shows me around his neighborhood. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It gets more rain than we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s big mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, Lawrence says, “I have sheep to move.” We start walking down the hill. He tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; the geese here eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie is not doing a good job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” Lawrence says, meaning the dog should go to the right. But Tie goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. Lawrence sounds disappointed. “That will never do.” Tie looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin manages the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they are hungry.”

But living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is not always available. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary preparing breakfast with a flashlight. I also have no mobile phone service. “You can get a signal on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days without their phones and then put them away.” So I do the same.

Life on Muck is surprising. A boat arrives today with groceries and three musicians who come to play music. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is very popular, and the islanders enjoy the music. 

That night, while sitting by a warm fire and listening to the rain outside, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the Isle of Soay in a newspaper and bought it without looking at it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know how to run a farm? “She had good typing skills.”

I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and give it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is delicious.

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the last two months because of rough seas. If my ferry does not come, I will be stuck on Muck for two more days. But secretly, I wish for that to happen, phone or no phone."

The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and self-taught people. Many people thought of video games as just a hobby for young fans, but now the industry is taken seriously. This change may surprise some, but experts in the field are not surprised. However, getting into the video game industry is not easy. Making video games based on new movies needs many team members and a lot of skill and hard work.

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, ""It is very hard to make progress in big companies or to change the big games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. They need not just the top people who manage the whole game, but also the lower-level people who design parts of the game.""

So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks differently. He says, ""The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something. Game design is more than a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, you must do it to understand it.""

Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it is more complicated. ""Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs today. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, and vision to help the industry grow.""

Can you succeed on your own? John says, ""Maybe, but it is difficult. A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and have a strong interest in arts and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but know that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand how diverse the industry is. 

Connections can also help. This is often forgotten, but to succeed in games, like in many other fields, you need to network.""

The old idea of a young boy playing video games all day has changed. Now, video games attract many adults and families. Smartphones have introduced many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. ""Games are now popular with many different audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this area growing with many new possibilities and opportunities."""
23,"Text: ""Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me. I am thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and has not played football since. I am glad that did not happen to me, but I know things could have been different.

When I score a great goal from far away, people often say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was a kid. You can only score amazing goals by practicing. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes I see young players bumping into each other, but I learned the right techniques. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills.

At school, I played many sports, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but football was my main focus back then. The teachers were doing a good job, but I did not notice it at the time. I do not want my son to be like that. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope he does not just want to kick the books around like I did.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could play for the first team. He never made a big deal about it, but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.

I depend a lot on my close friends and family. Having money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would not like to feel like they need my money. My mum does not earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I enjoy using my money to help the people around me.

I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. Having money does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off or even longer to do things I have not been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I break a leg while skiing and cannot play football again, I would not be insured."""

We lived at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to help us find a cheap place to live because my father was having a hard time writing there. He could not write anything good, and Sam was worried about losing his clients and money.

During the summer, the beach was quiet because the sun was often covered by sea fog. Few people visited Reef Point. The road to get there was not nice, and a better resort called La Carmella was nearby. Most people chose to stay there instead. Only those who had no money or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people were at the beach. After being alone for months, we were now surrounded by people and activities.

My father was busy every day trying to write a script. He was stressed and not in a good mood. While he worked, I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty started to follow me. I tried to send him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he didn’t really want to hurt him. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to? He thinks he belongs to us.” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.”

Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel. I had to return those to their owners. Rusty also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim faster. He never got tired of it.

That day, we had been swimming. My father had finished his script and went to Los Angeles to deliver it. Rusty and I spent the afternoon playing in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we sat watching the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. One surfer caught my attention. She was very good and made the others look clumsy. When she decided to stop, she rode in on a final wave.

“Hi,” she said. “Why didn’t you join us?” 

“I don’t have a surfboard.”

“You could get one.”

“I have no money.”

“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?”

“No, I live here.”

“Is your father American?”

“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.”

“Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?”

“Rufus Marsh.”

“You mean, Tall as the Morning?” 

I nodded. “I read that book from start to finish.” 

She looked at me with new interest. I thought this was how it always was. People were friendly but only showed interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning."

""What have I done?"" Violet Hetherington asked herself. She was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton. The line was outside the building marked ‘Departures’ where people were waiting to board the Queen Caroline. No one was moving. Her friend Annie had told her, ""It’s best to get to the docks late. If you arrive too early, you will just wait around."" Annie, who was married to a diplomat and traveled a lot, usually gave good advice. But this time, she was wrong.

After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. The mood among the waiting passengers became worse. Some tried to be patient, and a few even tried to be cheerful, but most people were unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted to enjoy it. Violet felt like leaving. She reached into her bag for her phone but realized it was missing. This was more annoying than the long wait. It made her feel that going on a cruise was a mistake. 

Now, she had the problem of her phone. She couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she left it in the taxi because all her important numbers were in her phone. This was the mistake her older son Harry always warned her about. Behind her in the line, there was a friendly couple. ""I’m sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make a call?"" Violet asked. She called Harry using the couple’s phone and left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if the phone was in her flat. If it wasn’t there, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, ""Thank goodness,"" but she didn’t tell Harry this. Harry thought he was more experienced than his mother. Daniel, her younger son, was more understanding of her mistakes, but he might forget to give the message to Kristina.

Finally, the line started to move, and Violet went to a window where she gave her travel documents and got ready to board. Her heart sank when she entered the ship’s lobby, which looked like a cheap hotel trying to be fancy. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, shiny brass, and carpets like those in airports. Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators,’ which were full of mirrors and crowded with tired passengers. They all looked worn out from their early morning travels. Violet was pressed against the side of the lift as it went up, stopping at each floor to let people out. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out and felt free. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had asked for. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to make sure she had a nice view of the sea."

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was starting to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures to use in a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer who had a talent for capturing interesting moments. Since then, Maloof has collected many items related to Maier’s life and work. In his home, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at all the items he had. He felt he was close to discovering something special, and it happened by chance. “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,” Maloof said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They spoke with families who had hired her as a nanny and talked to people at the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and had a unique style. She often wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.”

Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Even though she was not very social, she liked to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist and followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “She didn’t let anything stop her.”

Maier’s work is a pure form of art; she did not create it for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. “What is interesting about Vivian is that she has many fascinating pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style. “Was Vivian very skilled, or did she take ideas from those before her?” Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. 

Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I improved as a photographer and looked back at her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I had something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known and to get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"

When people say a novel is ambitious, they often mean it might not succeed. But this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, but she seemed calm, especially for someone in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. 

Eleanor shared a story about being stopped at passport control. An official asked her to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass. The official looked at it and asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s. A series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men is trying to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past gave her characters many chances for complications and misunderstandings. The book is more than 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good chance to shine. 

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said it feels nice to come from a small country. She feels that everyone at home shares in her success. She mentioned getting a lot of support from people’s grandmas. However, she finds it annoying when people think her book is not serious or philosophical. 

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, where each part is half the length of the part before it. The story speeds up as it goes along. I asked if it matters if readers notice these patterns. She said she wanted to create a book with patterns that readers could see if they cared to look. 

Even with its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she didn’t plan the story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then see how creatively she could get out of them. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers. 

We also talked about her love for TV dramas. I asked if she would be interested in writing for television. She said that could be fun. She spoke enthusiastically about her work and New Zealand. She noticed that being in a different place changes her imagination. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busy cities to be around more people. But for now, New Zealand will still be her home. I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."

When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has been building acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny loves the guitar and wonders how two pieces of wood can make such beautiful sounds. He learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven and wanted to learn the bass guitar when he was sixteen. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood change the sound of the guitar.

Jonny built his first bass guitar, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a job at that time. He also liked painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he went to university to study architecture because he liked design. However, he dropped out halfway through because he felt it wasn’t right for him. He realized that building guitars was like making sculptures, but with sound. He thought it would be a better job because people use the guitars he makes.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows to earn extra money. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials, but as he became known as a good guitar maker, he could charge more. Even now, after almost forty years, he says he is still just getting by. He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the beginning, Jonny worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals on weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his guitars because he didn’t think about money much. Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar makers today in the UK. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are respected for their quality.

Jonny thinks new guitar makers should take courses to learn valuable skills. However, he also believes that learning by trying and making mistakes is very important. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and what doesn’t. If you make the back of a guitar too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. He says that if you learn from someone else, you might only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, you can learn many different things."

When we talk about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a common tradition, and many writers mention the famous saying by Dr. Johnson, an English writer from the 1700s, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This saying is still true today. 

Many people try to explain why the English talk about the weather so much, but they often get it wrong. They think that English people are really interested in the weather itself. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that the English weather is not very interesting. He points out that in England, we do not have extreme weather like tornadoes or big storms, which makes it less exciting.

However, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that the English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that even if we do not have big storms, living on the edge of an ocean means we can never be sure what the weather will be like.

I believe that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point. When English people talk about the weather, they are not really talking about the weather. Instead, these conversations are a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, when someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to start a conversation or fill a pause.

Talking about the weather is like a social tool for English people. There are specific situations where we use weather talk. Some people think that English people talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. We usually use weather talk in three situations: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a pause in the conversation. 

Because of this, it may seem like English people talk about the weather a lot. A conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to more weather talk, and return to weather talk when there is a silence. This is why many people think that English people are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip, even more than going to Spain, Greece, or France. But they really wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt she didn’t have good answers. 

When she could not find a good historical novel about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as a writer in 2001. She felt that writing was a big change for her. “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very tiring. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues are jealous because I still connect with children through my stories,” she said. 

Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. “Many young adult books talk about negative experiences. They are well written, but they are often dark. Other books are total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different.” Alice always tried to teach English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy. She loves to see when a child goes from being bored to interested and from not understanding to understanding. “I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to make them interested,” she explained.

Alice started writing her first novel because she saw a need for it. She was also inspired by the idea of her two sons leaving home and a suggestion from her head teacher to take a creative writing course. At first, she was surprised. “I had been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me, but I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I didn’t think I needed.” Before she could join the course, she had to send the teachers her best piece of writing, which she only learned a few days before leaving. “I sat down at the computer and quickly created a story about a Roman couple and their baby. Three hours and 30 pages later, I sent it in and was accepted right away.”

During the course, other students read her story and gave her great feedback, suggesting she should publish it. With only 8,000 report cards showing her writing skills, she asked her school’s head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. It helped that her husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor. His help in editing the novel was very important. Alice said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are now rival authors, but I believe we work well together. He helps with what I write – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if something isn’t working, he suggests different words. My instinct is to keep adding more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor.”"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would have Jonny in a car and Alistair on a mountain bike, racing against each other in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. They would race to the same finish line. 

“I’m excited!” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done anything like this before. The views are beautiful, and it’s very cold, so I can stay warm in the car.” Alistair was also excited, but he wore warm cycling clothes, unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt. “Honestly,” Alistair said, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway!”

The race began at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, which is the highest road in Yorkshire, about 350 meters up. This would be easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill at the start. They quickly shook hands and then started the race. Alistair rode off on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and drove away. The big question was: who would finish first?

Jonny’s confidence quickly went down. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he faced a big problem. A giant tractor came out of a field and blocked the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman in his car. “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving. Meanwhile, Alistair was having a hard time with the hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the steep slope, while sheep watched him curiously.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. With the sun shining, he started to ride faster. In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The roads in this part of Yorkshire are very old and narrow. He had to drive slowly around a tight corner and through a small stream on the road. After leaving the last village, Jonny was finally on a straight path to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close they were to each other.

As Jonny drove quickly towards Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard, and then he had to brake suddenly as he reached the finish line. Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in celebration and shouted, “Yes!” 

A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car and got out. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, feeling disappointed. “I’m really sad.”"

When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the first thing you notice is the silence. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing only the echo of your own shots. The beautiful grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowd all make you feel separate from the outside world. This quiet helps my game. The hardest part for me during a match is to focus only on the game and the point I am playing. 

When a point ends, the silence is broken by loud applause, cheers, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me closely or the millions watching on TV as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach since I was young, taught me that this is the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win.

Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. Losing in 2006 was not too hard. I was just happy to be there at twenty years old. Federer won easily, but in 2007, I felt completely broken after losing. I knew I could have played better, and it was my mind that let me down. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance to win and you lose it.

Toni, my tough coach, usually does not comfort me, even when I win. But after my loss in 2007, he told me there was no reason to cry and that there would be more chances at Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand; I thought that was my last chance to win. I know that a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment is important, but some moments are more important than others, and I had let a big chance slip away in 2007. 

Toni could not take away my sadness, but he was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I felt confident that I had learned from my loss. The best sign that I was ready was that I believed I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we did not talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to mention it, but they understood that I was already thinking about the game in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that space in my head was mine alone."

In early April 1957, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always wanted."" She spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Jane Goodall became famous when Britain’s National Geographic Society published articles and made documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. She also wrote popular books, including children's books and the bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century. However, her fame sometimes makes people forget her real achievements. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her personal life rather than her work. 

Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading scientist because of her important research on chimpanzees. She helped us understand their social and emotional lives. Before her work, people thought wild chimpanzees were very dangerous, and they did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. Goodall discovered that chimpanzees have emotions similar to humans and that they have their own cultural traditions. 

Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" published in 1986, is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her long study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of becoming a biologist. When she was five years old, she disappeared one autumn day. The police and her family searched for her. After a long search, she came back with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she crawled into a henhouse and waited quietly for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."

In our first conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of different characters. She sounds like a funny 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an amusing old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV shows and cartoons. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says. “I had to learn how to say many medical terms quickly.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors think they can do funny voices, and some can,” she says. “But it’s more than that. You have to make the script interesting for an audience that can’t see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceover work, but they often don’t get the parts because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley took a drama course because she wanted to be an actress. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and surprisingly got a big part.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and thought voiceover work might be a good path for her. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult women often do the voices for small boys and girls because their voices are higher than those of men. There are many rules and forms to follow when hiring child actors, which production companies want to avoid. Shirley has learned to make different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. 

Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are hard because I have to sound excited about something I don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I’ve learned that smiling while talking makes my voice sound happy.” When she works on animation, it feels like a holiday because she enjoys working with other actors.

The competition for voiceover work is tough, and having a good showreel – a recording that shows what she can do – is very important. “It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has succeeded in her career through hard work as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel or practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests going to special workshops that teach different types of voiceover work. She also thinks it’s important to love human sounds. She describes herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing an American voice, for example, I might talk like that for hours or even days after,” she says. “My children are used to me talking in different voices.”"

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people give up these dreams and choose more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do just that.

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that needed political cartoons about local issues. I created some ideas, and they bought them. In a few months, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. The barriers to becoming a cartoonist are low, but it is still a tough job. You should only try to be a cartoonist if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have of making a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I take on all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But now, most cartoonists have to be entrepreneurs. This means you not only create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with selling, the better you will do. I have seen cartoonists with average creativity but great business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it can actually be a lucky break!"

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had bought for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar from Japan. I usually hate getting rid of things, so I wondered why I wanted to throw this guitar away. I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of trash when a young man came up to me, looking confused. He asked, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said “Yes.” After that, I felt sad about giving it away.

A few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it ten years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I read an email from a man named Keith Rushton, who restores guitars. He told me, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name and address on a label on the guitar and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy I almost cried. I would have given him anything, but his price was fair.

I remembered how my dad liked to put name labels on everything I owned, including my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. But I didn’t make much progress, so I switched to the electric guitar and played easier songs. At that time, punk music was also popular, and anyone could be a rock star, even if they didn’t play well.

When I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt amazing. It was smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are played that way. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands just knew what to do. My fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing the strings to play a chord. 

The electric guitar is not really meant to be played alone. Now that I am learning it again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"

There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote my book called Insomniac, which is about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was the only one talking about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep can affect our minds, bodies, and feelings. Many people who have trouble sleeping understand how important sleep is for our health. It is good that sleep is finally getting more attention. 

But what about dreams? I have not heard much about them in this discussion. We often lose our dreams. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss out on the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM sleep, or ‘Rapid Eye Movement’ sleep. This is the stage of sleep where we have the most vivid and memorable dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. If a person lives to be 90 years old, they will spend about six or seven years in REM sleep. 

When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they find that the next night, those people have more REM sleep to make up for it. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep, and many agreed with the famous psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. However, later studies showed that it is not that simple. Now, researchers focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. 

Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, according to Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of sleep experts, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study that showed actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than others. He believes that the more someone is interested in being creative, the more they use their dreams. 

It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wonder, are only creative people the ones who benefit from their dreams? Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present. Dreams can help us find new patterns and think outside the box. 

For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They come up with unexpected ideas that make sense in a different way. This is what creativity is, according to Stickgold. I find that I write better when I wake up from intense dreams. Even a dream that is troubling or hard to remember can help me think better. On those days, my ideas come out quickly, and I can hardly keep up with my typing. 

I don’t know exactly how it works, but it seems to help. However, creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complicated world, and everyone needs their brains to work well. We all need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea and many empty frames on the walls, along with happy photos of her two daughters. Susie is a well-known copyist artist. She can copy famous paintings from the early 20th century, like those by Impressionist artists, and also works from the 16th century, like Caravaggio. It is surprising that she does not keep any of her own paintings. “I don’t have any of my own around,” Susie says. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” 

Susie is very popular. In her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted many famous artists’ works, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts sometimes think they are the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions of pounds, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal the names of most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors love art, but others want to show off their collection. One famous buyer likes to say he has a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s up to them.” Some collectors keep the original painting in a bank safe and show Susie’s copy in their home.

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she tries to make it look as real as possible because she believes it is important to respect the original artist. However, she puts her own signature on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real painting, and even though she knows people who have done this, she has never wanted to. People who make fake art often get into trouble. Susie is not rich and has had some hard times, but her life is more stable now. She does not want to risk her good reputation with collectors and artists.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after finishing her art degree. She earned very little money for several years. Looking back, she thinks that job helped her learn important skills and gave her a love for plants, even though it was hard to live on that salary. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets about that time, but she is happy to have found a more rewarding job.

When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and represent things accurately. She also emphasizes how much she has studied to do her work. Her training allows her to draw plants, make perfect copies of 15th-century paintings, and reproduce 20th-century abstract art. Now, she focuses on French Impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas being her favorites. 

Susie believes that many people think modern art is easy, but she explains that Impressionists painted quickly and freely, yet they were also very careful. This combination is hard to achieve. Given her skills, it seems strange that Susie does not create her own art. Isn’t art about expressing yourself? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She says her work comes from years of training, and she makes a good living from it. She has tried to create her own art before, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. They were fine, but not better than that. It’s like living on simple food after enjoying meals from a great chef. Susie is a perfectionist."

Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything else when she was a racer. Since she was a child, she wanted to be the fastest person on the water. She felt a strong connection with her boats, which took her around the world. When she was back on land, life felt unimportant, and she wanted to be back at sea, challenging nature, even in places that were dangerous for her.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She took me into the tiny cabin where she lived for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was very important to her. She proudly showed me her simple food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical supplies. She took great care of her boat because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small and beautiful, but also fragile. A trip to South Georgia, a lonely island in the South Atlantic, changed her perspective. She helped with a bird survey and realized how humans often take what they want from nature and move on. 

When I visited her office, she was finishing a busy call. She told me why we need to act now to protect the planet. “We can’t make more coal, oil, or gas. They are valuable resources that we have only once. We need to find ways to use less,” she said. At first, her message was negative, but she later focused on re-using things, like industrial carpet tiles. 

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories and talking to businesses and governments about our dependence on resources that cannot be replaced. “I may not be an expert,” she said, “but I love learning. The current situation is something I cannot ignore. Sailing felt selfish compared to this work. It’s about finding how I can help the most.”

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a sustainable future. “I miss the adventure of being at sea,” she said. “It is part of who I am. At sea, you feel connected to everything, and you don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on survival and your goals. My new message is not as simple as saying, ‘I want to be the fastest around the world.’ I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I have done.”"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. He hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and explore nature, instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he is a teenager.

I spoke to some famous climbers who have climbed Everest. They do not think it is a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They believe that while a young climber might be strong, they may not be emotionally ready. They also think that a young person might not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing.

The Romero family has heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know people criticize us, but I don’t want to focus on that. We have a lot to do. I think about the risks, but I believe our experience as climbers will help us. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it just his father's dream? Paul says, ""This project is not about me wanting to be famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought he would do this later in life, but we decided, 'Why not do it now?' We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.""

When I ask Jordan why he wants to climb, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal."" In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest climber. But now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is seen as a chance to break records. This creates a problem for Jordan. Some people think that trying to achieve records takes away the fun of climbing. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his journey online, take photos, and give interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it is likely they are not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually do not know who he is. I have just started studying music at university, but my classmates know as little about classical music as most people our age. If you do not know who created the music, you probably do not have any of their recordings. This is sad for fans of classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only about 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. 

So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people often complain about our love for TV and video games, blaming them for this problem, but I do not think this is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts often, but they are not many. Even though I play in an orchestra, I do not really enjoy classical music. I like many different styles, but according to what I have on my computer, I listen to classical music about as much as that 3% figure.

So, why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many changes, can be hard for us. We like to talk, play, and think quickly. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Also, pop music often talks about things that interest teenagers, while classical music does not have lyrics and can be long.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music you want online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I do not know why more middle-aged people like classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people say that schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they play it, but it is not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we usually listen to pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it looked confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” said Bonnie, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” said her mother. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do it. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not get it over with?” She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a big area for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking carefully at each one. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best of the lot!” she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride the horse. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. It can’t be far.” Bonnie was happy to find that the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. While she was busy putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she could see. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said happily. “I really mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and a little breeze brushed past her cheek. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."

""I’ve met Cody Simpson before, and I have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old from Australia has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up on stage in front of thousands of fans? 

Cody says, ‘I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven.’ He remembers that he was swimming and surfing every day, and those activities were very important to him at that time. When he was 13 and in high school, he posted a few videos online. These videos changed everything. He started by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans wanted to see more of his videos on social media. So, Cody recorded more videos at home and shared them. The response was amazing.

Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on his sport. But then record labels contacted him, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the chance. 

He said, ‘It was very difficult for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 years old and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?’ He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. ‘It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,’ he remembers their shocked faces. ‘I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world.’

So, Cody packed his bags and moved with his family to another part of the world, giving up one dream to try to make another one come true. His family stays out of the spotlight and does not work directly in his career, but they support him. Cody believes it’s important to have good people around you to stay grounded.

Of course, everyone has doubts. ‘Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, “How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?” My little brother is eight years old, and he travels the world and does school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,’ Cody admits. ‘I worry about how this affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.’

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big chance, even when it’s a little scary. ‘Everything happened so fast and unexpectedly,’ Cody says. ‘Now, I am going to countries I never thought I would visit and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like a dream for many people. But I know it won’t last forever.’"""

I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags last week. I had worked with many people in the town for long hours to help. My grandfather did not pay much attention to my work. 

I looked at the dark water coming from the wood processing factory in Milltown. There was fragile ice on both sides of the water, and solid ice further down. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and put on my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Only my grandfather, my mom, and I know about this chain. I also have his diary from that trip, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. 

I patted the chain and went to the kitchen. “Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.” “Thanks, Mom,” I replied. I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. “Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” “Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was clear because I was wearing my wetsuit. Grandpa always gets angry, and it is hard for me to deal with it. “What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. 

My mom came over with a kind smile. “Don’t mind him. He’s…” “...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I wanted to say he has always been like this, but I kept quiet. When I was younger, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his wall, along with his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay close to him, even though he is grumpy. 

My mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. I stepped into the backyard and hurried to the boathouse."

Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her into the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was a painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s, but it looked different from his other work and was not finished. “Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” 

Jess looked closely at the painting. There was a river in it, but it was not a river she recognized. It looked like a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was very small, with just a hint of green that was easy to miss. The pale water seemed to lead to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: “River Boy.” The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 

Then Jess noticed something. She looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” 

“Exactly. It’s strange, isn’t it? For him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” 

“Mum! You should have known better.” 

“I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.” 

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would say, “It’s not the artist’s job to explain a painting. Each painting has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. Painting is hard work, and I can’t waste time explaining it to everyone.” 

Mum laughed. “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.” 

“Inspire?” 

“Someone who gives an artist ideas.” Jess knew what it meant. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the inspiration was not helping him that day. He never said it was about her. She thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone influencing someone as strong-willed as Grandpa. 

“He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He’s been painting all his life.”"

This morning, I woke up and accidentally cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn’t mean to do it, but it could have happened if I had tripped over the bed while holding Dad’s Stanley knife. The knife might have gone into the carpet by itself. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me often, and I feel unlucky about it.

What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into my room. My Gran gave me this cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small, painted white, and has pretty flowers on it. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, but now I keep my shells and fossils there. I was very happy when Gran gave it to me!

The problem is that it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to go in a corner. My bedroom is the smallest in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. There are two corners in my room. My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet in the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. 

Then I thought, if I can’t cut the cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet instead. It seemed like a good solution. Dad always tells us to “think outside the box,” and that is what I was trying to do!"
47,"Text: 'The novel ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They borrow things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn’t want to be told I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans', which made filming more difficult. 

The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be ten times further away than usual. When filming the human world around the Borrowers, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for special shots. 

One big challenge was making sure the shadows looked right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We created a special technique for this. After the series was shown, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we did it. The only set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very strange. I remember the coins we used; they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much. 

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t need to act. It was also important to me to get the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they looked like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the leading actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I drew 2,000 by the end. They weren’t perfect, but they worked. We didn’t have enough money for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – once I filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series was successful in showing the magic of the books.'"

My mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there aren’t any. I know that soon there will be attention on me. There will be fake smiles, new friends who want something from me, like free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet normal kids. I want to meet kids with regular parents, like a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so cool.

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. She seems confused. “Oh,” she says and types my last name on her computer. That’s good because not many people know my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she says. Then she gives me my schedule. My first class is English Literature. Great! I like English. But I will be late because it’s in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly trying to find my classes.

When I get to the door, I hear the teacher calling names. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip into the room quietly and sit at the back. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. No one will suspect me! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with flowers on them. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses. “Desert... McGraw?” she says. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After that, she lets us talk to each other! All teachers should do this.

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few choices. Should I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or should I say what my dad thinks? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. It has energy, color, and culture.” I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose a studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to move,” I tell her. Yes, it’s better to lie. “What does he do?” she asks. Everyone will find out soon, but I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care much. Great!"

Today, American teenage girls are expected to do a lot. They should be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in school. Being a teenager in America means you cannot just go to school and be average; you need to be ambitious. Many adults forget how much pressure teenagers feel. They have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and they also want to have a social life. 

Teenager Kristen Loose says that even with all these stresses, people still have negative ideas about teenagers. Some think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, and only care about themselves. While some teenagers may fit these stereotypes, Kristen believes it is not fair to label all teenagers this way. She says many people think teenagers spend all their time on their phones and watching TV. Kristen admits she often has her phone nearby, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. 

Today, students need to be connected to the world and reachable all the time, which can look like an addiction to their phones. With smartphones and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they can listen to language lessons. Schoolwork now takes up a lot of their time, even outside of school. Many teenagers wake up around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often go to bed after midnight. They have a busy schedule with school, activities, family duties, and homework, and they usually get less sleep than they need. 

The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are tired. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week, which is not much when there are 168 hours in total. She does not waste her free time on social media or TV; instead, she spends it on volunteer work. 

Lindamarie believes that many people think teenagers only care about themselves, but she loves volunteering and making a positive difference in her school and community. In the future, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to prove people wrong and make the world a better place. There will always be new students who are ready to take on the world before they finish school."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US. This town is mostly surrounded by wild nature, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, this small group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long science project that is also an adventure, which is why many teenagers join. 

I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to try to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and creates a bright light. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer to check the temperature as the balloon went up. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to help find it later. 

A gas tank, given by a supporter from another state, was used to fill the balloon with gas, making it grow to the size of a small car. An older boy drove seven hours to get the gas tank. “I didn’t really mind,” he said. For kids in this club, this is normal. Finally, it was time for the balloon to go up. “Five, four, three, two, one,” they counted down, and the balloon started to rise. Some of them ran and followed its path with bright flashlights until they could no longer see it in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night.

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky, which was surprising because it was only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” said one girl quietly. “I know,” whispered another. Suddenly, a meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, and the balloon got bigger until it popped with a loud noise. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recovering the lunch box is a big part of the program,” said the group’s leader. They had lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “This journey helps us know the landscape better,” he added.

This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students know the Eastern Sierra well,” their leader said. “What seems wild to some is normal for others.” 

In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not record any shooting stars. This was a little disappointing, but it gave them a chance to talk about how atmospheric waves work above mountains. It was also another adventure story to share with anyone who asked."

Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. ""My younger brother was really into dinosaurs, which I didn’t care about at all. I helped him with a science project, and when I read an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology, I was amazed. I knew I wanted to pursue this field.""

I asked her how she got support because Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people. ""I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,"" she laughs. ""His name was Matt Cornelius, and he was already famous, even though he was young. I was very nervous, even though he was known to be friendly. I worried he would think I was just an annoying kid asking too many questions. But I felt better when he was patient and listened to me.""

I wanted to know what she thought about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowned for a moment. ""I have to say that movies like Jurassic Park, which show dinosaurs with special effects, have made many people interested in dinosaurs. But they don’t really show Palaeontology well. I find it annoying that we are often shown as strange geniuses or awkward people who can’t talk to others. Movies don’t show what our daily work is really like.""

I asked her to explain her job. ""My job is very varied. I spend a lot of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also work in laboratories, studying fossils and writing scientific papers. Sometimes, if I have time, I also explain scientific findings to the public. I think it is important to help people understand science better. There are many misunderstandings about it. I want to reach out to young people because it is important for them to learn about science. Talking about dinosaurs can get children excited about nature and help them understand other areas of science.""

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to help show dinosaurs correctly on screen. She says the makers of the show knew what they were doing, and she was there to give advice if needed. ""I had an easy time because there was not much I needed to change, like making sure the dinosaurs were the right size and shape. I mostly checked that the dinosaurs shown lived at the same time. We attracted audiences of all ages because we have learned so much about dinosaurs recently. The dinosaurs in this show are very different from those in movies like Jurassic Park. They look much more realistic.""

I asked Chloe why she thinks dinosaurs still fascinate us and why research continues. ""I think they appeal to our natural curiosity. We are drawn to things that are new and exciting. In a world that feels smaller, dinosaurs remind us that there is still much to discover. Palaeontology is like time travel."""

I want to say something important about traveling by car with your family. Even if you are six years old, you know that you are not “there yet” when you keep asking, “Are we there yet?” When you finally arrive, it is not “there” anymore; it is “here.” So, if you think you might be “there,” you should ask, “Are we here yet?” 

I believe that no one wants to be “there yet” more than parents who hear this question many times during long car trips. Think about it: wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the beautiful views outside the window. In the front seat, your mom or dad is there to give you juice boxes and cookies, change the radio, and make sure everything goes well.

But sometimes, things can get crazy in the car. For example, my younger brother, Tim, often does something annoying, like putting his foot on my side of the seat. I don’t like that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and our parents have to separate us while driving. They tell Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This helps for a little while, and we can enjoy the beautiful scenery again.

Later, when I try to read, I feel a breeze on my arm. The window is closed, so I wonder where it is coming from. Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. This makes me angry, and the fighting starts again. Our parents yell, and the car swerves. But after a while, things calm down again.

Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he often says, “Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.” But we are still on the highway, going fast. Then he says, “Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.” This makes us quiet for a bit. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults get out of the car and move far away from the kids. So remember: if your mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is: no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using their phones or other devices. She believes that people should be together and talk to each other.

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. Everyone stays involved and feels part of the game until the end. 

Later, cooperative games were created, where all players work together to win or lose as a team. One popular cooperative game is Pandemic, designed by Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players must work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the famous book. He remembers feeling scared and excited while playing it with friends. He wanted to create a game that made people feel good, whether they won or lost.

Leacock has loved board games since he was a child. He often felt disappointed when games did not meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he tried to make better games using the pieces from the ones they played. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up game improved game design even more. Leacock explains that it has a lot of storytelling, similar to video games, where players develop characters and the story changes.

The rise of video games has helped the popularity of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games too. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone has at least one game on their phone. 

For a while, video games allowed people to interact physically, like at arcades or when playing together in the same room. But as video games moved online, players became more distant from each other. This made some people want to play games with others who were physically present. 

In John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just fun. In our online world, games are now something to share in person, and this trend is likely to continue."

Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that hard work and not giving up are very important in the music business, even if your career starts slowly. He says his mother was a great singer and helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio he listened to at home was a local station for older people, which influenced his music as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song.

Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he did at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the music room at school learning songs on the piano. He said, “I was doing well in tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for my whole life. It was just too much hard work.” At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not want to make a career in music.

Jamie remembers going to his parents and telling them he wanted to be a musician. He had been writing lyrics during his economics lessons and playing the piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he got signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, the record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend.

In the end, he became more successful as a songwriter than as a performer. After a tough time with a record label in the UK, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. He did not become famous right away. He said, “I feel like I have been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of my career, but as a writer, I have been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he found success. He believes he is one of the main writers that UK labels turn to for new artists.

Sometimes, he has to explain to the artists he helps that wanting to write popular songs is okay. He asks them, “Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?” He believes they should aim to write songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well. It is nice to hear someone in pop music talk openly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he knows he has a talent for writing number one songs. Instead of trying to please others, he focuses on his work. He says, “When I go into the studio, we need to write the best music for next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write great modern pop songs.”"

Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, do not know him because we do not watch videos of people doing tricks on bikes. He is called a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another strange place. These jumps are filmed and shared online.

On the day I interview him, we meet in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids all know who he is, and some older people come to tell him he is ""an absolute legend."" After watching him perform, I agree with them. At first, I was unsure about him, but I am impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I cannot believe he will succeed. When I compliment him, he seems uninterested and a bit sad. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to connect with fans. He prefers to focus on doing his stunts rather than talking about them.

Tony thinks that social media and new camera technology help him earn money from his hobby. He says, ""Sometimes I feel like everyone is filming themselves or looking at screens, and I don’t always like that."" However, he is not unhappy. He makes a good living from his videos, which is different from how it used to be for people in his sport.

From my experience interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two important things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength is needed. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy obstacles. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, ""People who say this may care, but they do not understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and do not know much about the sport. They do not see that I get advice from experts to reduce risks."" 

Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, ""People are different. Some are not scared, and they should not do these sports. It is smart to know the dangers. I can feel fear but find a way to overcome it. I am not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes I ride around for a while to get ready before trying a new jump. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus completely, I will be fine."""

Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. These include running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, just a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her keep her balance, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found out that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” said Helen. “I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then I did an hour of exercises, and another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen controlled her nerves by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterwards. “I’m glad it’s over!” However, this experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-fashioned bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. He had already written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.” 

Jeff did not want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. He thought the most interesting bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more surprised people were by his bike.

His worst experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"

This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but we don’t know what they do at night because we didn’t have the right equipment. The new scope will give us clear pictures, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and make better choices about how to protect their habitat.

Our work is very hard. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and write down what I see. The weather has not been easy – some nights are warm, but most of the time it is wet. It is very quiet, so I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. I enjoy this challenge, especially when I think about the summer. In summer, we will spend hours in a laboratory looking at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this work. I wouldn’t change it for anything!"""

Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure that customers get the best quality chocolate from my company. Every week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate, from our factory. I have to check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for the chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I also share samples with my colleagues! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients to work with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel to buy our raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety in my job, even more than the chocolate itself!

People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never wanted to stop eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"""

Have you ever thought about what it is like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says that the course is popular because it teaches many skills. Students learn to juggle, throw and catch things like balls or even fire, and they also learn trapeze, which means flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

The course lasts for one year, and students slowly take more risks in each class. Parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains, “To have a career in the circus, performers need to do different things. It is important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always want to improve their skills. 

People often think that circus performers get hurt a lot or that they only work for a short time each year. But the real challenge is thinking about the future because you can only travel and perform while you are young. After that, you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students start their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that this is not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”"

This means she sings in the background to support the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers, but that is not true. They often have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry!

Mariam says, 'What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it is a funny song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what the producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do my job!'

'To do my work well, I need excellent musical skills and the ability to learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are already long!'

'One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can see how to make it better.'"""

These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie thought about different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to make the right choice. When she chose satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie said, “Many people said there was no demand for them – but I was sure.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never worked before but was good at business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. 

Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her succeed. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew, as did the speed at which her company made them. Now, Julie enjoys waiting to see which celebrity is seen with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online ads, she uses the internet community for ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. 

There was a difficult time when another company copied Julie’s design to sell similar bags. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often say there is a positive feeling in her offices – people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place.'"

When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to play many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to balance training with her schoolwork.

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started to compete. Vicky thought this looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.

Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, “For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it. When the excitement goes away, there’s no point in continuing. Luckily, I found a new job.”

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. She said, “We work with young people who have never enjoyed sports. The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job and helps young people feel part of a group.”

The charity uses famous people to promote their work. Vicky said, “Some people think having a celebrity support a charity is not always good. They believe celebrities do it for their own benefit, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"

Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, there was always music in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. Ana wrote her first song, called Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed writing so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about how this made her feel. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was happy when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics.

Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join his company. At first, she was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. But Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. All the tickets sold out quickly, and it was a wonderful evening.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments because she feels she has more to say then. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how sad it made him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on a wonderful trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit this area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before they moved to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him, and he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was good. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry said he would take care of everything, so I felt better.

When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and started our journey. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast now. On our first morning, the only living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the morning fog made it hard to see far. I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t know. It was nice to forget about time and just enjoy the day. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. Even though the beds were hard, it felt relaxing.

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. I didn’t want to go back to normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"

You might think that watching so many matches would make me love basketball, but it did the opposite. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real match. The teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I was in a game against another school. My parents came to watch, which made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t a big change for me. In the end, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""

After thinking about different options, I trained to be a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed giving tours. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from the tourists' perspective, and it felt new every time!

After I finished my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I found out that I needed to know a lot more than I had learned. All tour guides in Chicago must answer many questions about the city, including local history, architecture, and public transport rules. After several months of hard work, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping track of the group. You also need other skills. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you must be able to handle unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems.

I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a bad review online. Like most tour guides, I know that good reviews are very important because they attract more customers. That’s why I try to make my tours fun and stress-free. I believe that my enthusiasm and energy help me get good reviews, and many visitors recommend my tours to others coming to Chicago."""

We went to help at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we had nothing to worry about. 

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, which was small, but we chose to do this because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I think she might be a little upset with herself for not enjoying her time more because she missed her friends. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"""

Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we did.

It is often cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were buying for myself, I would probably choose only pink flowers because it is my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like is not always what my customers want. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I cannot find what customers want.

I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it is part of my job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then we create flower bunches and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That is what you have to do when you sell things – I wouldn’t want any other job!"""

We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was great! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs – we do not want to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier for us, especially now that we have our own good equipment. We can also see how many tickets we have sold online, so we do not worry about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us at the end how much they enjoyed it, it feels wonderful. Our website has helped a lot, and we are now in touch with other film clubs around the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but it is always nice to return to our own club! We have also started a blog because we know that many people look online for information about films instead of reading local papers. We have tried putting up some posters in cafés, but nothing is as good as people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we have with each film – last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""

So, I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began.

After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that many people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and started to focus on nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost gave up, but I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for my age group. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and I could work as a professional photographer.

In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn something new. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you finish each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure it was a good idea because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy then, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. 

When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made good friendships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it. Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before starting at the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one of them is for camping!"""

The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly fell in love with the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten years old. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for snowboarding and winning has grown as I got older. This helps me to work harder.

I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well. For example, I became the first female to get a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I could do the jumps that got me this score until I tried. This achievement made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying when there is no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends during this time. It helps me deal with not being able to do what I love and what I am good at.

I think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I also want to have another option in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I can find time to study while being active. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."

One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for making me do that because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I thought it would be hard, but it was easier than I expected. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me how to make something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family. They said they liked them, but I wasn’t sure if they really meant it. I wanted to know if other people would like them too, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home. Soon, we got calls from people all over the country who wanted to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at the stall! That made me realize my business could work, so I decided to create a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun!"""

When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, “Because my father’s job made us move around a lot, I learned to make new friends easily. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia’s experiences in a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I am an only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.”

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to write. The year before, she won a short story competition on a young writers’ website. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer mentions that even though Janine is young and her novel is not very long, she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: “At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I will have interesting things to write about!”"
76,"Text: ""My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father was invited to be the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy to get this job, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We thought the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school on the island.

After we moved, we quickly got used to living on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. In the summer, the island is lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families who live here, and there are not many teenagers, which I had hoped for. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, and this can be hard work.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry!

We often see amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then it can be sunny again in a few hours. This still feels amazing to me, even after living here for a long time. We do have terrible storms sometimes, and I wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But I remind myself that it has been here for hundreds of years, and it is still standing!"""
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different bird species apart and where to find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we returned home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am almost there. On family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! 

I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fun hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I walked onto the stage. I knew what to say and had some notes, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year!

I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."
78,"Text: ""I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew I often liked new hobbies but then stopped doing them, so they thought I would do the same with football. But I didn’t. I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a good player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13 years old. I got much better after that. Still, some people were not sure I would become a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s important matches earlier than I thought I would! I ran very hard because I didn’t want the other players to blame me if we lost. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with a big crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to let them meet other players in my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and encourage them to think they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times, but also some bad times. I have had very few bad times, so I feel lucky!"""

In recent years, there has been an interesting change in education in the UK and around the world. Schools and universities are encouraging new students to get involved in research early in their studies. This shows that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists, but is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are important not only for studying but also for jobs, as they help us think about the world and how we do our work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat information; you create it. Making knowledge starts with asking questions instead of just accepting things. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can be seen in two ways. On one side, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts. On the other side, there is everyday research that involves asking thoughtful questions about issues and making practical suggestions. Most students have done some form of research before. You have likely done research for school projects or when you needed to find information for personal interests, like planning a holiday or fixing something at home.

In college and higher education, it is important to have a curious mind, identify problems, and critically explore information. You are expected to create your own responses and knowledge. Some students may find this difficult because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and students are taught to listen to teachers and texts without questioning them. However, in many places like the UK, US, and Europe, it is important to question established knowledge and those who claim to be experts.

This process of questioning and creating knowledge can be challenging. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research done by others can help us as students and in our future jobs, but we should not just repeat what we read. We need to think about it, test it, and check if it makes sense and is supported by evidence. We should not blindly accept facts and information from others without thinking critically about them."

Cities have always been important places for ideas and discussions. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso discussed art in cafés. However, living in a city can be difficult. The same cafés in London that encouraged conversation also helped spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 

Today, cities are known for creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming. Scientists are studying how city life affects our brains, and their findings are surprising. While we have always known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in a city can actually make it harder for us to think clearly. One reason for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains relax and work better.

For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into busy cities with many strangers. This crowded environment can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. When we walk down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people walking, cars, and confusing street layouts. These small tasks can tire us out because our brains have to work hard to focus. 

Natural places, on the other hand, do not require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature can help our brains recover. Natural settings have things that catch our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and looked for ways to bring nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can help our brains feel better in just a few minutes. While people have tried many ways to improve brain function, such as energy drinks or changing office designs, walking in nature seems to be one of the best solutions.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Research shows that the same crowded features of cities that can make it hard to focus also help create new ideas. The close social interactions in cities are important for creativity. Just like the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of modern cities can also lead to innovation. 

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, there will always be times when people feel tired of nature and want to go back to the city."

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to show this. However, I believe that studying the mind should not only focus on what is inside our heads. There is a lot of evidence from history that shows that objects, as well as our brains, are important for our thinking. 

For example, tools, jewelry, drawings, and writing have all played a role in how humans have developed and how we think. Therefore, what is outside our heads might also be part of our minds. It is easy to think of the mind and the brain as the same thing. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the things they usually use. This is useful for scientists who study the brain, but it often ignores that much of our thinking happens with the help of things around us. 

I do not want to say that the brain is not important, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It is better to think that human intelligence goes beyond our skin and includes culture and objects. This is where my new idea, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects can help us think, like when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to create a tool. It also studies how these ways of thinking have changed over time and what that means for us.

This idea helps us understand what minds are and how they work by looking at how objects help our thinking. For example, think of a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can work together. The stick helps the blind person feel and understand their surroundings. The brain even treats the stick as part of the body. 

This example reminds us that human intelligence can change a lot when we use new tools. I see the human mind as something that is always changing and developing. It is important to remember that, no matter what form the “stick” takes in our history – from early stone tools to smartphones – its main purpose is to help us explore and understand the world. 

For humans, tools are used to satisfy our curiosity. This special ability to engage with objects is why humans create things more than any other species, and how these things shape our minds. I call this idea metaplasticity – our minds can change and grow as we interact with the world around us. I want to bring the importance of objects back into how we think about the mind. MET offers a new way to understand how different tools, from ancient hand-axes to modern smartphones, have helped define and change who we are and how we think. Technology that changes our minds may sound futuristic, but humans have been using it since we first appeared."

Photography is one of the most important inventions that has changed how we see the world. This is especially true in the United States, where photography became a big part of culture. It is used in many ways, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians believe that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. 

Photography became popular in the mid-19th century. There are several reasons why this new art form was so appealing. First, photography is a mechanical process, which matched the growing interest in technology. Just like steam power and railroads made communication and travel easier, photography brought images of the world into people's homes quickly. 

Second, the camera became a popular tool for people to show their identity. It allowed individuals and families to create images that represented them, even if those images were idealized. Third, photography's realistic style matched the trend of realism in US art, which focused on everyday life. 

Every photograph draws attention to something specific. It shows what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they are records of events, people, and things. This gives them a sense of objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by a person, it also carries the photographer's point of view. 

People often think they understand a photograph because they recognize the subject. This is why photography is often called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph can be more complicated. The things we see in a photograph do not always speak for themselves. The way we understand an image can change based on its context, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. 

To understand a photograph's history, we need to consider why the photographer took it and how people first saw it. The same image can have different meanings depending on where and when it is viewed. 

In recent years, artists have started to use photographs in their work more openly. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings and silk screens. Today, photography is seen as an important part of art, working alongside painting to help us understand representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition helps us understand psychology even today. Everyone has a mental life, which means we have some idea of what it is, but it can be hard to study. James was especially interested in human psychology, which he believed included basic elements like thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not match scientific facts.

Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to provide methods to find out which explanations are most likely correct in different situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our personal thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

Psychology, as William James defined it, is about the mind and brain. While psychologists study the brain, they do not yet fully understand how it works in relation to our feelings, hopes, and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and making educated guesses about what happens inside us.

A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but we cannot see the mind in the same way we can see a machine. We can only understand it indirectly through behavior. Studying psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle; it requires careful observation and logical thinking. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to change the processes it studies. When psychologists achieve these goals, they can help us understand our experiences and improve people's lives.

Psychological research has been useful in many areas, such as teaching children to read better, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings when they are emotionally distressed. Although people have discussed psychological questions for centuries, scientific investigation of these questions has only happened in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at one's own thoughts and feelings, to find answers. While this method is still interesting, it has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton said, it only shows a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to turning up the gas to see how darkness looks. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than just on their own experiences."

In a storehouse in a simple business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows products that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. It is owned by a company called GfK. The owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own sad story about the designers and marketers who created it. 

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a business. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products. Each week, business executives visit the museum, showing how rare it is for companies to think about their failures. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing worker, wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. He began collecting every new item he could find in the 1960s. He did not realize that most products fail. Because he collected so many new products, most of them turned out to be unsuccessful.

Today’s culture of optimism may explain why many products ended up in the museum. Each product likely went through meetings where people did not see that it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might spend more money on a bad product to try to make it sell. They often do not investigate what went wrong, and everyone involved may choose to forget about it.

This focus on being positive is also common in the self-help field. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which means that if you imagine good outcomes, they are more likely to happen. Some scientists, like Tali Sharot, have found that our minds may be naturally inclined to see things positively, which can help us survive. However, people who are well-balanced may not have a clear view of their true abilities compared to those who are depressed.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied how thinking positively about the future affects motivation. They found that spending time imagining good outcomes can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For example, people who thought about having a great week at work ended up achieving less.

Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, believes that how we view failure is connected to our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" think that ability is something you are born with. They find failure very scary because it shows they did not meet expectations. For example, a sports star who thinks he is a natural talent may not practice enough and then fail. 

On the other hand, people with a ""growth mindset"" see failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles grow stronger when they are pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games far away, like in Asia, to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often think that the order of events explains what happens. For example, when a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans remember cheering and then seeing a goal, but they forget the times when cheering did not lead to a goal.

There is one idea that seems to be supported by science. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct their noise at the referee. In a famous study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another group watched in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in many sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, but now they win about 60%. One reason for this change could be travel. In the past, traveling was difficult, but now players travel in comfort. Also, stadiums today are more similar and less unique than before.

Despite these changes, the reason for home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while team sports like basketball rely on teamwork. Playing at home helps build confidence among teammates.

Another interesting point is about players’ testosterone levels. Studies show that players have higher testosterone levels before home games, which may connect to a natural desire to protect their home field. In some recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams won at home against stronger teams, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, “It’s the law of the jungle out there.”"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous among athletes and their coaches. It is easy to understand why. Many people argue about who first said this quote, and its meaning is not clear. Player did not mean 'lucky' in a real way; he was being ironic. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ 

This idea connects to a big question: Is talent something you are born with, or can you develop it through practice? Many believe that practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for saying that you need 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in any field. This idea has been popularized in books like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers and Talent Is Overrated. These books suggest that practice is the most important factor in becoming an expert.

However, author David Epstein argues that this idea is not always true. He points out a problem in studies about successful people: they often only look at those who are already excellent. Epstein asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not. He travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, to find answers. 

In Alaska, he learns that the drive and desire of sled dogs might be important in a tough race. This suggests that some traits might be connected to genetics, not just practice. Epstein believes that both nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are important for elite athletes. He does not ignore the role of training or support. For example, he thinks that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in the world.

Epstein also discusses race and gender in sports. He asks an important question: ‘If only practice matters, why do we have separate competitions for men and women?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""

A recent international report shows that many children living in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so sad? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, looking at screens like televisions and computers. They have lost touch with nature, such as forests, mountains, and rivers. She believes this is a big part of the problem.

A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. The study found that many children do not want more technology; they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, saying they enjoyed playing outside, swimming, and exploring. They think this was better and healthier than the lives of children today. However, they often forget that they created the rules that keep their children indoors, worrying about safety.

Griffiths’ book has many strong opinions. She discusses how parents’ fears about dangers outside make them keep their children at home. This fear helps companies that sell toys and gadgets, as they want to keep children entertained indoors. She also talks about how some people give medicine to children who are restless or make them wear goggles for playground games. It is unclear how common these rules are, but Griffiths expresses her anger about them.

While her ideas are interesting, Griffiths sometimes goes too far. She compares how we treat children today to racism, which seems extreme. She has a very romantic view of children, believing they are naturally good and creative. However, this view may not match reality, especially when dealing with energetic young children.

One important idea in the book is that children should be allowed to explore and take risks. Griffiths thinks children need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create safe situations for these small accidents. Also, not all children want to explore the wild. Some are shy or prefer to stay at home. Perhaps the real problem is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether we keep them inside or push them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill does not come only from school. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or answers we memorize in school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play.

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Those who have more to learn tend to play more. For example, carnivores (meat-eaters) play more than herbivores (plant-eaters) because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates, like monkeys and apes, play more than other mammals because they need to learn more and rely less on instincts.

Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are allowed to. Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling their emotions.

Creativity is very important for success in today’s world. We do not need people who just follow instructions or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can help people think ahead and find solutions, we will have a strong workforce. But this requires creative thinking, which comes from a playful mind.

Many adults we call geniuses keep their childlike ability to play and think creatively throughout their lives. For example, Albert Einstein said that school almost took away his interest in math and physics, but he found it again after leaving school. He called his creative work ""combinatorial play."" He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen if he caught it.

We cannot teach creativity, but school can sometimes take it away by focusing on questions that have only one right answer. More importantly, children need to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which they will need later in life.

Play is voluntary, which means players can choose to stop. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players know they must keep each other happy to continue the game. This freedom makes play a very democratic activity.

However, school has become more difficult. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. ""Play dates"" with adults supervising have replaced unsupervised play in neighborhoods. Adults often feel they must step in instead of letting children solve their own problems.

These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact. They are caused by many social factors, such as parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."

In many countries, more and more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers. This is easier than the old way of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, using social media can also lead to mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. But the executive was upset by his request. She refused to connect with him and sent a rude message that became very popular online. Many people were shocked by her message, and she might regret how she responded. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could help them.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. This is surprising because social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's lives for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people at school. You could also change how you looked to others by choosing different pictures or songs for your profile.

But using social media for professional reasons is very different. Some young people do not see this difference. They learned to be bold and confident online, which can lead to problems. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers' expectations to succeed in their careers.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual in their messages and seem arrogant. This makes older generations think young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be good employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing some research or helping in another way. This will give you a better chance of getting a helpful response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone polite to make a good impression. Remember, social media can help you make important connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid being ignored."

It is hard to predict the future of newspapers. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people reading UK national newspapers has dropped by about one-third to one-half. In the USA, a study shows that only 26% of people get their news from newspapers, down from 45% in 2001. Some people believe that printed newspapers will disappear in the next 15 years. However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. 

For example, in 1835, a journalist in New York said that books and theater were finished and that newspapers would be the most important source of news. But theater survived, even with the rise of cinema and television. Radio is still popular today, and cinema has also done well against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are becoming popular again, with online sales increasing a lot since 2008.

Newspapers were once a new form of media, but it took a long time for them to become the main source of news. This change happened in the mid-19th century when new technologies like the steam press, railways, and telegraphs made it easier to share news quickly. People began to expect regular updates about the world around them, which was very different from the past when life was more predictable and slow.

Before the 19th century, journalism was not a full-time job for most people. There was no strong need for news every day or week. In some ways, having newspapers published regularly can be a problem. Now, with online news, people can read what they want when they want. They can also get updates on important stories very quickly. Mistakes can be fixed almost immediately, and there are no limits on how much information can be shared.

However, many news providers focus on being the first to report news rather than helping people understand it. In the past, news was often shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. Today, it seems we are going back to that way of sharing news. Newspapers have not always done a good job of explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand things better in this confusing world."

If humans were truly comfortable under the moon and stars, we would walk happily in the dark, just like many animals that are active at night. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This fact is part of our nature, even if we don’t think about it. It helps explain what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by adding a lot of artificial light. This is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also creates problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study.

Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design. This means that artificial light shines in the wrong directions, lighting up the sky instead of focusing on the ground where it is needed. Bad lighting makes the night less dark, changing the light levels that many living things, including us, have adapted to. When human-made light spreads into nature, it affects many life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding.

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the largest city in the world. Almost a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few homes had gas lights, and there were no public gas lights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have smelled London more than you would have seen its faint glow.

We have brightened the night as if it were empty, but that is not true. There are many nocturnal animals. Light is a strong force in nature, and it attracts many species. Scientists say that some birds, like songbirds and seabirds, can be ‘captured’ by bright lights, flying in circles until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into tall buildings that are brightly lit, and young birds are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange times because of artificial light.

At first, it was thought that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Most of us may not need a perfect view of the stars for our work, but we still need darkness. We cannot ignore darkness; it is just as important for our health as light is. Changing our natural sleep and wake cycles can lead to health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is connected to the natural light changes on Earth. These patterns are so important to us that changing them is like changing our balance.

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own bright lights, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural history – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the beauty of a dark night filled with stars."

The founder of a large international company recently said that his business will no longer keep track of how much paid holiday time employees take. This idea seems to come from a smaller internet company that has a similar policy. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a happy email from his daughter, which many newspapers shared. However, some people think this way of announcing the change is just a way to make the policy seem friendlier, even if it might not be very generous.

Is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational company has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work schedules. In a big company, it is hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business or their careers.

The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, but only if they are sure their work is up to date and their absence will not harm the business. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more work waiting when you return. This means that employees might feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress. If workers do not take enough leave, it could lower their productivity over time.

There can also be pressure from coworkers about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a situation where employees feel they cannot take holidays, especially if they want to get promoted. If the legal rights to paid leave are taken away, workers might feel they cannot take the time off they need because they do not want to seem lazy.

This new policy could make employees feel stuck, as they might not take their entitled leave or only take the minimum amount of time off. Modern technology makes it hard to separate work time from free time because employees can receive work messages anytime and anywhere. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance this new way of working with the old rules about time off.

However, having no set working hours can be a problem because it means that employees might feel they are always working. They may worry that their employer is watching them, which can lead to stress. Employment laws exist to protect workers, ensuring they have a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. While the company hopes that unlimited leave will improve morale and productivity, I am not sure that allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is really the best solution."

Peer review is the process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. This process can delay the publication of a paper by up to a year. Some people think this delay is worth it to make sure the research is trustworthy, while others do not. 

I still believe in peer review, but I see changes happening. More researchers are using preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed. Preprints help researchers share new findings quickly so others can read and discuss them. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can change the motivations of authors and reviewers. 

Competition for space in top journals encourages scientists to do great work, but it can also lead to shortcuts. Sometimes, important data is left out to make a paper look better. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, what is popular or newsworthy can matter more than scientific quality.

Many people know about these problems, but few want to change the current system. However, some scientists believe that preprints could help. Even though preprints have been around for twenty years, not everyone uses them. Some scientists think that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a worry that publishing papers without peer review could lead to poor-quality research, but this has not happened yet.

Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors know that their work will be open to feedback from a global community of reviewers. For example, Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. She said that when she critiqued another paper, the original authors could respond to her comments. This open discussion allows readers to judge the quality of the arguments. 

Preprint archives allow scientists to have informal discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also share negative results, which are often ignored by journals that focus only on new discoveries. Additionally, papers on preprint archives are read and cited more often, showing that sharing research this way is effective. By using the internet's openness and collaboration, preprints can help scientists focus on the research itself, not just where it is published."

When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" Their answers usually do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group of students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph was to describe the object like a scientist, and the other was to be from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I am a device that helps people breathe. I am only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The object? An oxygen mask – a surprising choice that helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and good discussions.

When I was in school, poetry often confused me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we hope to find in poems? Isn’t a poem a place for deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings are nice to look at, and music is hard to beat with its mix of words and sounds. 

However, one thing a poem can do is show us uncertainty. Everyday life is full of uncertainty, unlike reading a sentence. But this still does not tell us what a poem really is. If you search online for ""poem,"" it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as a type of art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is fine, but it does not explain the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poí?ma,"" which means ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who makes things. 

So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – unpredictable and free – or to machines – carefully made and exact – depending on their views. But these comparisons can break down when we think about them closely. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both. It can help us see ordinary things in a new way.

Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially when we consider how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and music has a strong effect, just like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, looking right at you: A poem can touch you like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. 

What about the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten just like an article or story, but it is not usually made to be sold. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry books, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not just a product for sale; it is something special. Because of its unique place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."

I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. £70 was a lot of money back then, and it might have been better spent on something useful for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, every brooch and coin I found made me happy. I liked feeling connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I decided to go to a nearby spot where I knew there were old farming tools. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then, it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I had to check. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, thick loop. I stopped and stared. I remembered seeing something like this before - the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It’s a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. The word ""torc"" means ‘twist’ and it is made of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring like the one I found.

I took it to my car. On the way home, I kept looking at the torc on the passenger seat. I washed it in my kitchen sink, which was probably the first time it had been cleaned in a long time. “Marion!” I shouted, “I have something for you.” As I looked at my find, I heard my wife come into the room and stop. “What is it?” she asked after a moment. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were afraid of damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I eventually got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says that I must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before I gave it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, stopped talking, and looked at the torc. It was confirmed as real and later sold to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. I received £350,000, which was shared between the owner of the field and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It is something I have saved for the nation. People say to me, “Now that you found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing, especially if there is a chance to catch a bigger one tomorrow."

Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their carefully planned trips, where every moment is filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans often include time for naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in nice hotel beds?

Better sleep is one of the good things about traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping—more than 12 hours most days. There were many noisy birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Far from home, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and enjoyably. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, I found it easier to sleep. 

I believe that sleep is not just a break from traveling; it is part of the travel experience. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences fill our minds, and when we sleep, we process them. This is why sleep feels different when we are traveling. 

People often worry about jet lag, but I think the problems I have after long trips are more about adjusting to new places and cultures than just time changes. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, then take a break around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and come back to life in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and one by one, my friends went to relax on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows on the floor. I took some pillows and joined them. I had heard about the Latin American custom of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.

Travel sleep has another great quality: I remember it. Being away from home, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If enjoying every moment of travel is what makes a good traveler today, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is an important part of the experience too."

The woman turned away from the mirror. “What do you think? Please be honest.” Mia picked up a medium-sized hat that was soft and had a pretty layer of fabric with a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a funny face. “But it is so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will make me stand out.” She patted the red and black mini top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” 

Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at her daughter’s wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie. They didn’t know anything about Tattie, and Mia’s husband, Jeff, had quickly pointed this out when Jen called last week. “Tattie? What kind of name is that?” Jeff had said. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “More like something very strange,” Jeff said. He didn’t like anything that seemed showy or pretentious. He also didn’t understand Mia’s way of being polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a trash can lid would look better on her. “The problem with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite.” 

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered her home, Medlar House. It took her only forty seconds to get home from work. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to turn the empty barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was not sure. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. Mia knew from her friends that many women had trouble finding the perfect hat for special occasions, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became successful. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham, where she made them feel welcome and allowed them to try on many hats until they found the right one. She encouraged her customers to bring their outfits so they could match everything perfectly. Recently, she also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."

It is a long way from London to Atlanta, and in his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye thinks about his amazing journey in sports. He feels confident but is also surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic final in discus to possibly starting a new career. Even though he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA.

In Atlanta, Lawrence is still learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London, who is new to the sport, might be selected for one of the biggest teams in American football. But Lawrence is good at proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to focus on training for discus instead, after playing rugby before. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus, preparing for the world championships. He says, “Yes,” when asked if he is really considering a big NFL contract. He thought about American football before, but it seemed like a crazy idea at the time. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played football, he thought he could be good enough to attend the trials. “Pretty much,” he says. He applied online.

Was he nervous about being tested with experienced football players? “No,” he replies. “I don’t get nervous for many things.” He does not talk a lot, but he is sure of his abilities. His performance in tests showed that he was the most impressive player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he says, showing a bit of pride.

However, he is also cautious. He has no experience in football. How can he make it into an NFL team? “Coaches have told me I have the right skills. It’s all about how hard I work,” he answers. Will he be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness might come from his experience in the Olympic final, where he came last. He seems to have moved on from that disappointment and is proud that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he says. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic experience, some people thought he might not recover. Lawrence does not want to talk about that. An NFL player’s minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so there are clear financial reasons to switch sports. Lawrence has moved from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talent, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replies. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"

I had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty land below. The dark shades of brown and green made me feel better because, even though it was mid-September, it was still summer in Siberia. I could see no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a slow, Russian accent. His name was Sergei, and he was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to sell safety clothing to the local mining companies. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either, but I used a dictionary to tell him that I was going to the city of Magadan in far-eastern Siberia with a one-way ticket. I planned to ride my bicycle back home to England. 

“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I believed there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will ride with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to explain with hand gestures that I had warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I was not sure if they would be good enough, especially my big postman’s over-trousers that I bought for £10.

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of tired students. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was talking on and on. I was thinking about a problem. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I wrote a note: “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” Al, my old school friend, was sitting in front of me. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, wrote something, and passed it back. I opened it and held my breath while I read, “OK.” 

Now, six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. Although I was still learning how to manage my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling. Plus, I had long holidays to go on adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al caught the adventure bug and decided to cycle around the world instead of teaching. Since our first ride together, Al had taken on bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest challenge yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would be too hard for him. Even though it sounded difficult, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving the doubters wrong who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."

In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to be part of this race. 

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form confirmed that I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything during the flight. When we started moving down the runway, I was nervous. My legs were up, my feet were away from the important pedals, and my hands stayed away from the switches. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is a difficult part of high-speed acrobatic flying. To stay safe, you need to be calm and focused. You have to know when to tense up and when to relax. Panicking is not a good idea.

As we began to speed down the runway, I felt nervous. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out and turned sharply left, diving down. My stomach felt strange as we flew down to 2,000 meters. 

Seconds later, we were just 10 meters off the ground, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, but I was surprised by a sharp right turn. We hadn’t even done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, but my hand was shaking so much that the plane shook too. Then Dario said something, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, turning the plane completely. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” he asked. “No,” I lied.

Then he did a loop, flying up and over, making a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, while we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during the race. To show this, Dario took out some sandwiches and started eating as soon as we landed. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about the loop over and over again."

Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever seen amazing videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He says his favorite temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to make a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours, I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, and underwater work.""

Now, he is a top cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series. ""I started at a good time. When I began, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became known as the cold man. It felt like there were many amazing scenes waiting to be filmed.""

When he started 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very simple. ""It is much easier to film today. Back then, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much material.""

""My experience in cold conditions is very valuable. I feel comfortable there. I have spent so much time on sea ice that it feels normal to me. I do get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes.""

Allan says that wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify the birds. Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would not be easy. It is a place for polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, it is usually -32°C, the wind is strong, and carrying cameras in deep snow is very hard. After walking for five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub. 

On day 24, he felt like he was part of the bear world. ""We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. After five hours of watching, I see something very quickly. The camera is ready, and I look through the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds, and then I see a black nose. The nose becomes a head, and in less than a minute, the bear is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She looks at me but does not care. Just as I think it can't get better, she slides down the slope. I think she is enjoying it,"" he says. Then, two cubs appear at the den entrance. ""It is clearly their first view of the world. It is showtime on the slopes, and we have front-row seats.""

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects their lives. He believes he could make an amazing documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. This meant he had to swim in very cold water, deal with frostbite, and avoid polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new adventure that he says is even more important. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. This time, he and two friends will go on a three-month journey of 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen knows the results will be very important for scientists. This work will show how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar region.

Pen was prepared for this job since he was a child. His father’s old nanny, who worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, helped him become strong. She sent him out into the Scottish mountains during storms with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in cold places, and Pen grew up to be very strong. 

Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and the outdoors. She helps him run his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he often thinks about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a famous mountain event where horse riders compete with people running. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. They live in the countryside with their two children. Pen says it is harder to be away from them this time. When he last left, his son was only one year old, and he told him to take care of his mother and sister. His son took this very seriously and kept asking how they were, which became too much for him. Pen thinks it was not fair to put that pressure on his son.

For this trip, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while he is in the Arctic. He believes that calling them will remind them of how far away he is. In the days before he leaves, he is carefully preparing his equipment. He says that when he is on the ice, it is very hard to fix things or do anything complicated. He will be with Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them by flying in supplies.

Pen feels that being part of a team can be stressful for him. He is also thinking about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He says that organizing things always seems more important than training, and he is worried about what he will have to do on the trip. Pen believes that this mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge, which is important for everyone. He admits that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, the scientists will benefit from the information they gather. He wants to involve as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He believes this work is important, and they are the only ones who can do it. He feels that their unique skills are now very useful to society again."
103,"Text: ""I took a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Even though I enjoyed these activities, I wanted to find something competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape so I could try for an Olympic place if I felt inspired again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But being an underdog without pressure was interesting to me. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat, which made the race feel real. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would still take work to get the money. I also had to think about losing money by being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It feels good that people are interested in what I have done. But I find it hard to talk about my past without having a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just talk about what I did before. I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was hard, but it was also simple. I trained almost every day, but my training plan was clear, and I had doctors and dieticians to help me. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, but my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing. It is also about mental strength. Ben had done tough challenges, but he couldn’t row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of understanding of his situation. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest with Ben about how much he needed to improve. I should have known what to expect when I agreed to race with him."""

Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of cold, beautiful Arctic landscapes, maybe because I was tired of the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a job as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is a pretty but basic location with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but I needed to know what I was getting into. ""The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical,"" they said. I started packing right away.

November 6, London  
On my flight, I stared at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. I remembered that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. But now, I saw winter moving south, and the rivers were freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta  
The bus ride north was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer cross the road. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. ""Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?"" Anna asked. I followed the sound of barking, which got louder as I reached the dogsheds. Three people were running back and forth, pulling the huskies out and getting them ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited, pulling against their ropes. I could barely introduce myself because everyone was too busy to talk. I stood to the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone told me to ""Get in!"" and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and we took off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

November 15, Hetta  
I quickly learned how to be a husky guide, but first, I had to answer questions about what I could do. ""Are you useful?"" Anna asked. I was confused. I didn’t know. Further questions showed that I was not very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. ""You do have a driving license?"" someone asked. I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But other tasks were complicated. Simple things like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was overwhelmed with instructions, and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,"" I emailed my friends. ""In the snow."""

On that day, when Paula Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters came to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was good enough to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special treatment called emu oil, which Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman had suggested to help Radcliffe heal from an injury caused by an accident when she ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe said that she did not fully realize how important her achievement was at that moment. Looking back, she understands it was a big deal, but at the time, she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. She and her team had decided not to set any limits on their goals. Their motto was ""no limits.""

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could keep up her fast pace. He was worried she might have to drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry about this, but he understood that someone who didn’t know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to think about her time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers quickly, but she still managed to sprint the last distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a long time. Radcliffe thought, ""I will come back and do it next year."" Unfortunately, that did not happen.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, helping her with her training as she ran 250-300 kilometers each week. He said, ""I have worked with 63 Olympic medalists, and no one could handle the pain like she could. She would make me work hard because I had to go deep into her muscles.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for a friendly greeting; Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour training session. Hartmann said, ""Paula would push you to your limits. That is what made her so good."" He spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became upset.

Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, would do it. Maybe it's because people are racing against each other instead of racing against themselves."" What does she mean? ""It’s about always pushing yourself, even when you are winning. I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always about going as hard as I could."" Radcliffe did not know it at the time, but that marathon was the best performance of her career. She would never run that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."

When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ in Britain. I believed we had created a series that added something new to this movement, but I still worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and nervous. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. 

In each project, I felt like I was on a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving travel and new experiences. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent many years trying to reach their own ideas of perfection.

Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew I would disappoint some people by not including their favorites. I could imagine people asking, “Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that would please everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on their feelings, memories, and experiences.

Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew I wouldn’t say that the recipes were the best or final. I believed that by using my cooking skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, chefs, and their customers, I could find out what makes these dishes special. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means improving through practice. It’s about trying new ideas and changing them until you create something unique.

The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before. I was excited to look into memories and feelings connected to food because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me all over the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which made us stop filming there! While perfecting each recipe, I even hand-milked a cow and used dry ice to make ice cream, cooked chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burned my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza."

We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the engine. He looked at it for a long time with his hands in his pockets and a serious look on his face. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he finally said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big and empty, just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, because it was better to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything they talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound sure. “Liar,” she said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it got dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."

Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke good English. They talked about the music they were playing and their travels. 

“I think I’m going to Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world. Because of this, she missed a lot of school and was not officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She was lucky to be chosen from thousands of applicants. At the party, her dad gave her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate. Her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Lucy’s teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself. Her mother filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom said. Lucy thought her mom didn’t want to give her the chance to say no. Back then, Lucy believed it was wrong to complain, so she didn’t try to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in and asked, “Tanglewood?” 

“Yeah.” 

“How old are you?” 

“Fifteen.” 

He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to brag. It was hard to know when to share her achievements and when to be humble. 

“It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying…” 

“Excuse me,” Liesel/Louisa said, looking away as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed. “Have you ever been to Japan?” 

He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool. 

“Once. When I was about eight.” 

He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather came over. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” 

“They're not the competition.” 

“Everyone is the competition.” 

Her grandfather took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said. 

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” 

Lucy liked that. Being recognized felt good, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play difficult music. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."

“It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,” said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I decided to see what experts say about this topic – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have a lot of real-life friends, a good sense of who they are, and are learning important skills for the digital world.

Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social networking is now a big part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do; they live in it. This is not necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it. 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the youth clubs that parents used to go to. It helps teenagers share jokes and gossip, and it helps them grow away from their parents and deal with teenage issues with their friends.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that adolescence is a time when you ask, “Who am I?” Social networking can help with this. You can share your favorite music or sports, find out what you like, and see that other people think differently. Research shows that teenagers who use social media a lot are not as self-centered as those who don’t.

He also says that social media can help shy people. Talking online can be easier than talking face-to-face, and it can help you practice social skills in a less scary way. 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with special interests connect with others who like the same things. If you are one of the few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a group online with people who share your interest, you can feel more connected and popular in a different way.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: young people can find new interests online, join groups with similar interests, and create their own content. She thinks social networking is becoming a way for teenagers to be creative. They are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites are also helping photographers connect, learn new skills, and share their work. 

This creativity can help them get jobs in the future. Every business uses social media to sell products and attract customers. If you create a product and have 1,000 friends on social networks, they could all be potential customers. If you connect all your networks, you have a customer base.

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working. Matthews agrees that many sites offer chances to work with others to create and share content. Working together is an important skill in today’s world and helps with getting jobs in the digital age."

When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not think of a long trip across nine western states in the US and one Canadian province. But my parents wanted to have an adventure for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan a family trip that my twin brother and I were not excited about. “Not enough people do this anymore,” my parents said as we got ready for the trip, while my brother and I exchanged worried looks.

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for any weather. I was excited but also worried about losing my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our “Family Great American Road Trip.” As we left our big home for smaller places to stay for the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into.

We drove west through Oklahoma. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. We saw deserts turn into mountains. Each day felt similar, but we still had unique experiences. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we realized that the roads marked for Jeeps were not for regular cars.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. We often had to deal with construction traffic. We laughed when we saw the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms and watched the sunset over bear habitats. We experienced “bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross the road, which created some unforgettable moments.

As we drove, life at home felt far away. Even the old hotel we stayed in, which had no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t stop our excitement. It was a 95-year-old building, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we started our journey back home. My parents were right; you don’t need to go to a faraway place to find something special. 

It was nice to be home together again, and I was happy that I didn’t fight with my brother during our long trip. We took three thousand photos of our adventures, and I knew that I would remember the unexpected and fun moments the most."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and would live under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay at school, so she was happy to have the best room with a kitchen and study area. She also liked that she could use the Internet and phone for free. Jeff and Dahlia would check on Amy, whether she liked it or not. 

So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had some vague memories of her grandmother and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not very happy, but Daisy was excited to have Rose with her. Rose did not understand why her parents did not get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Because of this, Rose had spent her summers away from Daisy, even though she had happy memories of her from when she was ten years old. 

Dahlia told Rose that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose expected to get dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not like a typical old lady; she went to many social events. 

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But Rose wanted one thing: her independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She hoped her grandmother would trust her to do these things. 

Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone for emergencies only, and Rose was very happy about it. They all agreed that it would be about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to make good choices, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If either of them went too far, they would talk about it again. 

Rose was not a wild child. Her few friends were similar, so her school reports were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this was the last time she would change schools because she would be starting her final two years. For Rose, it was a new beginning in her life."

Charlotte Grainger says that her primary school teacher first thought she might write a novel. “I believed that writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed like a challenge. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’ The novel I started then is about to be published.” 

Charlotte recently told her former teacher about her book, and the teacher was surprised. She thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40 years old. Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait to do something she was good at.

It is a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a great achievement: it has a strong story and is full of action. Nothing about it, except for the age of the main character, shows that it was written by a teenager.

A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn’t. She is confident and smart, but also calm, which keeps her from being too overconfident. Charlotte knows she is still young. When I ask her about the important moral questions in her book, she says, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She laughs and adds, “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I’m very wise. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.”

Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and how they are often shown in books. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. She feels frustrated by these character types. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about teenagers who are not struggling in some way. Some writers give the impression that teenagers don’t know who they are because they lack experience. This can hurt their self-confidence.”

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but their books almost stopped her from writing. “My favorite fantasy writers explore deep ideas about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to write like them to create a good book and if I could do it.” However, she praises a book called *How Not to Write a Novel*. “It says that if the reader starts to guess what will happen, the suspense is probably gone.”

Some people might think that Charlotte’s parents, who are both journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father knew someone in publishing, which helped her book get read. She knows she is lucky because it is hard for anyone to get a first novel read, no matter their age. “Every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. In the end, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."

“Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,” said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. “Now, who wants to go first?” The group looked nervous. Then a guy named David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew up into the air, but something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. “Remember,” Gareth said kindly, “speed can be unpredictable.” 

I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I was not like those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid of looking silly if I tried to join them. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a training center for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students jumped and tried their new tricks, landing in foam cubes – not a real experience of skiing.

After practicing indoors, we went outside to try it for real. “Progression is inevitable!” the center’s slogan said. “Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,” Gareth explained. “But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.” The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope goes down to the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which is better. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important.

At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to slow down, and I often landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt tired. “You need to control the jump, not let it control you,” said Gareth. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied the moves we would do while ski-jumping, and others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing while in the air. Gareth gave us tips. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off and then found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline.

We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of my achievement. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I made myself go fast as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead of me, no longer attached to my feet."

Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold tightly to the safety harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly goes up. There is a pause, then a quick drop that makes your stomach feel funny. You go fast forward, turn left sharply, and then go upside down. Everything around you is a blur, and you scream in fear. But you chose to be here, just like many others who pay to enter the theme park.

I find it interesting that amusement parks, with their exciting rides, are a big business. To create the thrills that people want, there are many teams of engineers and designers working behind the scenes. The job of a rollercoaster designer might sound like a dream for a child, but it is actually very challenging. They must create a ride that is both fun and safe, while also making it new and exciting for visitors.

Many people think that rollercoasters are getting more intense, but most of the designs we see today were created by a US designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. In the past, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers have to follow certain rules and use specific designs from ride manufacturers.

I talked to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a ""thrill engineer,"" said that the skill is in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts, an engineer, explained that it is important to quickly change between feelings of excitement and safety so that people enjoy the ride without feeling scared. 

To create a great ride, the teams must come up with a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, that fits with the ride's features, such as height and twists. However, Professor Walker said that in creative work, experience and testing are very important. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that it helps to love thrills when designing rollercoasters, so you know what riders want and can test the rides before they open.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers will use new technology like virtual reality. Walker said we should not expect too much from it. He explained that while virtual reality can make rides look exciting, the real experience of being on a rollercoaster is what people love the most, and that will continue to be important for many years. 

**Questions:**

1. What feelings do people have when they are on a rollercoaster?
2. Who is John Miller and what did he do?
3. What is the main job of rollercoaster designers?
4. Why is it important for designers to test their rides?
5. What did Professor Walker say about virtual reality in rollercoasters?"
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things with her busy schedule. She says, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the orders of strict choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers can forget how hard it is to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, Miranda teaches and enjoys working with young dancers. She explains, “A new dancer is often open to trying new ideas. Working with students can be easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they don’t always know their strengths and weaknesses. This means they can accept even tough criticism. Sometimes they challenge what I say, but I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. She says, “There may be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece of music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece of music. I wish I could be more experimental and change the music to improve the mood during tough rehearsals. But now, I mostly work on big productions where the music is already decided.”

Miranda believes in meeting new people and not sticking to one place. She says, “It’s important to make new contacts. But I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to change how I work each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing everywhere. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

The conversation shifts to a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, “There have been glamorous documentaries before that were not true. This one tries to show what life is really like in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I smiled because I understood her struggle. She knows she is not doing it right but can’t make her body do what is needed. It’s hard to watch, but it is real. People often underestimate the work and dedication needed in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She replies, “It’s when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Perfection is hard to achieve, but aiming high is important for the audience. Sometimes I have worked on productions where the dance steps are good, but the costumes or props are distracting, and that is disappointing.”

Miranda has done many different types of work, so I ask her if she sees herself as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She says, “People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There is a trend to focus on one area of expertise. I don’t follow that, but maybe one day I will be known for one thing. For now, I just want to explore more.”"
116,"Text: ""A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on TV. I agreed that there are amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to carry it. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I have walked on foot many times, but this was something very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I could stop at cafés along the way to relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."""
117,"Text: ""When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I usually travel with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I told him I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would join ten others to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and showed me on board.

Before we started, our group had exchanged emails, but there was not much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would follow us, and they made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km. I felt nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The next days followed a routine: jumping in, swimming at a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I also got faster and enjoyed them more. I felt like I didn’t need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come back again next year."""
118,"Text: ""Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it has many good things. Since I started this job, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, I have a lot of free time, and my life is never boring. This makes it a great job for someone young like me! 

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to the passengers. Some of them let me help. 

Later, when I wanted to change from my banking job, I remembered this experience. At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people like me, and many of them were changing careers too. I practiced what to say before the interview. I talked about my skills and my work experience, not just that I loved to travel, like everyone else. Because of this, I got the job!

I think this job is great for many reasons, but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: 'no one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. 

When I am not working, I don’t have to take my work home. If I do have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!"""
119,"Text: ""At the summer camp where I work, I enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they thought they could not do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great.

At the start of the week, some children miss home. It is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds who feel this way, not the younger ones. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and at the end of their week, they thank us because they had a great time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call often to ask how their child is doing, which is not necessary. Their child is usually busy playing games or doing other activities, so we tell the parents to call back later.

We often see a certain type of child at camp, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it is important."""
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, doing the show with an all-British cast was not easy. The UK has more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night. Everyone wants to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me that the young actors are very busy. ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends,’ he said. 

What do his friends think of the show? ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I told Jamie that I also play guitar, he found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 

The young actors were already musicians, with some playing different instruments, but none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
