A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling people where you are online. When you say, ""I am here,"" you are also showing everyone where you are. Some people might not be nice. This shows that sharing everything online can have problems. 

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives. We can share our stories and photos. But sometimes, we can lose control and feel lost. This can be sad, but we should not give up. There are people who have gone through this before us. 

In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the internet. At that time, the web was mostly for students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his life, so he created a blog. Many people liked to read about his adventures. He wrote about everything, and anyone could be part of his stories. 

One day, people saw that his blog was gone. Instead, there was a sad video called Dark Night. Hall had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to stop or lose his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. 

In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job. One day, someone at her work shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can have real-life effects. 

Armstrong was sad but later got married and started her blog again, focusing on her family. Now, she is very popular and makes money from her writing. She learned that we can say anything online, but we should be careful about what we share. 

**Questions:**

1. What did the website talk about?
2. Who is Justin Hall?
3. What happened to Justin Hall's blog?
4. What did Heather Armstrong write about?
5. What did Heather Armstrong learn from her experience?"

Some scientists wanted to tell people about a movie called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This movie mixes real facts and stories. It shows that there is a lot we do not understand about our universe. Some scientists did not like the movie. They called it “atrocious” and “dangerous.” 

At first, I did not understand why the movie was important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries. They said the universe is stranger than we thought. Then, the movie talked about how water can change because of our thoughts. I heard that a researcher in Japan showed that water can look different based on how people feel. The movie showed nice pictures of ice crystals that looked good when people were happy and looked bad when people were sad. 

Many people like these pictures. They think they are interesting. But scientists want more proof. They want real evidence, not just pretty pictures. The movie’s ideas were not strange enough. 

Real science shows that water and the universe are very complex. Scientists have found new things. They say the universe has a type of matter we do not know about and a force called “dark energy.” 

Scientists also found that our brains take time to understand what happens around us. They believe they know where modern humans came from and how they spread around the world. Some scientists think there is a link between life on Earth and the design of the universe. 

Science is always changing. We are learning more and more. There are many things we still do not understand. Some scientists are trying to find a “Theory of Everything” to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. But many people think the universe is amazing and incredible. 

**Questions:**

1. What is the name of the movie that some scientists talked about?
2. What did some scientists think about the movie?
3. What did the movie say about water?
4. What do scientists want instead of pretty pictures?
5. What is one thing scientists have discovered about the universe?"

Both are important to me. In the forest, there are tall trees and green leaves. The wind moves the leaves, and they can be bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies. 

Since I started writing, I have written both novels and short stories. When I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. When I finish short stories, I want to write a novel. I do not write short stories when I write a novel, and I do not write a novel when I write short stories. 

I began my career with two short novels in 1975. From 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I did not know much about writing short stories then, but it was a good experience. One of my first stories, 'Breaking Waves', was in my first collection called Tales from Abroad. 

One good thing about short stories is that they do not take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to write a short story. Writing a novel takes a long time, sometimes a year or two. Writing a novel can feel very long, and I sometimes wonder if I can finish it. So, writing short stories is a nice change for me. 

Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from small ideas, like a word or an image. It is like playing jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. You do not have to worry about failing. If an idea does not work, you can just move on. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver did not write perfect stories every time. This makes me feel better. 

I learn from my mistakes in short stories and use that to help me write novels. Short stories help me try new things. They are like small memories I have shared with my readers. I remember each one and how I felt when I wrote it. Short stories are special to me, and I am happy to share my feelings with my readers."""

Science is important. It helps us understand the world and can cure diseases. Science makes our lives easier, but it can also create problems. Scientists study many things, like tiny atoms and the universe. They try to explain how everything works.

Sometimes, scientists disagree. They have different ideas about how things are. New ideas can change what we believe. For example, a long time ago, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Now, scientists know it is much more complicated.

Famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein helped us learn a lot. They found new things, like radioactivity and atoms. Science is always changing, and there is still much to discover.

Science is not just for scientists. Everyone should understand it because it affects our lives. What scientists learn can change our future, like how we live and how healthy we are. It is important for everyone to pay attention to science."

Since about 2015, big book companies have said that sales of ebooks are not growing as much. Some companies even lost money because they thought ebooks would be very popular. People still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question makes us think and talk a lot. Why do we think ebooks and printed books are in a fight? The answer is not just about ebooks; it shows how we feel about new things and changes.

In my research, I found that people often think one type of media will end another when new technology comes out. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would stop. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. The idea that books will disappear is not new. In 1894, some people thought that phonographs would replace books with audiobooks. This has happened many times with movies, radio, and smartphones. Some people worried that if books disappeared, culture would get worse. Others thought ebooks would be much better.

When new technology comes, we feel a mix of hope and fear. We get attached to things like books and TVs because they are important in our lives. Studies show that we can even name our cars or get upset with our computers. So, when something new, like e-readers, comes out, we have to change how we feel about things we love. This is why people still want old things. For example, when the printing press was made in Europe, people wanted to find old books. When movies changed from silent to sound, people missed the old silent films. The same thing happened with photography and music.

E-readers made people appreciate printed books more, even their smell. This should make people feel better about printed books not disappearing. But the idea that books might go away will still be a popular story. This story shows both our excitement for new things and our fear of losing what we love. We often tell stories about endings to help us understand changes. The story of the death of the book is easy to remember and share. It shows our hope for the future and our fear of losing parts of our lives."

Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how great thinkers from the last four hundred years worked. I wanted to show how they found time to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, and worked. I hoped to show their personalities and habits.

There is a saying: “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.” I say, “Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap.” This book is about how people work, not just what they create. It is also personal. I think about how to do creative work while making money. Is it better to work on one project or do a little each day? When there is not enough time, do you give up sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time?

I do not have all the answers, but I want to show how many successful people faced the same problems. I wanted to show how big ideas become small daily actions and how habits affect work. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it is really about people’s routines. A routine can help you use your time well. Good habits can help you focus and be more productive.

The psychologist William James said that good habits can help us think about important things. He was a procrastinator and could not keep a regular schedule. Ironically, my own procrastination helped me create this book. One Sunday, I was at my job, trying to write a story. Instead of working, I cleaned my desk and made coffee. I am a morning person and work best in the morning. That afternoon, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I thought it would be good to collect these stories, so I started a blog called Daily Routines.

In the blog, I shared people’s routines from biographies and articles. For this book, I have gathered more information and made it better. I let the people I wrote about share their own words from letters and interviews. I also summarized some routines from other sources. This book would not be possible without the work of many biographers and journalists. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for more reading."

Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist when he was six years old. One day, his father said they could not go on holiday to Spain because of money problems. Instead, they went to a beach in England. On the beach, Howard found a small fossil called an ammonite. He liked fossils and wanted to study them.

When Howard finished university, he wanted to find a job as a palaeontologist. He was not sure if he would get a job, but he believed he could do good work. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help him had a fight with his wife and got into an accident. He could not come to the interview.

Another professor, who did not like the first professor, was there instead. This professor helped Howard get the job. Howard was surprised but happy to have the job. He could now do the work he loved.

One day, Howard's briefcase with his lecture notes was stolen at a train station. He was very upset. He went back to the college, called to postpone his lecture, and reported the theft. After that, he had coffee with a colleague who was visiting from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. 

During their talk, Howard learned about new fossils that needed to be studied. This was a big opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm and not to take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find money to visit the museum in Nairobi.

Charles Spence likes to eat many different foods. He is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He has ice cream made from bee larvae at home. It looks strange, but it tastes a little like nuts and flowers. Spence and his team study how our senses help us taste food. They want to make eating bugs more normal. 

Spence helps big food companies and restaurants with their food. He studies how we enjoy food. For example, who we eat with, how food looks, and even the sounds around us can change how we taste food. In his book, The Perfect Meal, he shares interesting facts about eating. Did you know that the first person to order food in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal more? And when we eat with one other person, we eat about 35% more food. If we eat with three people, we eat 75% more!

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple. He uses old equipment and has quiet rooms for testing. He works with cooks who do not have a lot of money for research. Many of his projects are funded by big food companies. Some people think that research with companies is not real science, but now it is important for universities to show their work helps people.

Spence helps food brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. This is good for customers because it helps them stay healthy. Many companies do this slowly so that people do not notice the change. Spence says that if people know about the changes, they may not like the food as much.

Spence met a famous chef named Heston Blumenthal while working on a food project. They worked together to create a dish called ""Sound of the Sea."" Spence studies how sounds can change the taste of food. For example, high sounds can make food taste sweet, and low sounds can make it taste bitter. Soon, an airline will play music that matches the food they serve.

Spence has fun dinner parties at home. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colorful lights and headphones to see how they changed the taste of drinks. For Spence, home and food events are just like his lab."

Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, like facts, rumors, and chatter. We need to find what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do these things by ourselves. We are trying to do many tasks at the same time, like taking care of our families, jobs, hobbies, and watching TV. Our smartphones help us with this. 

But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a scientist, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we try to do many things, we switch quickly from one task to another. This is not efficient. Multitasking can make us feel stressed and confused. 

When we try to focus on one task but see an email, it can make it harder to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus while seeing emails can lower our IQ. It is even worse than being tired. 

When we learn new things while multitasking, the information goes to the wrong part of our brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV, they do not remember the information well. Without distractions, they can remember better. 

Making decisions while multitasking is also hard for our brains. Small decisions can take as much energy as big ones. After many small decisions, we can make bad choices about important things. 

Many people talk about email as a problem. It is not about email itself, but the large number of emails we get. We feel we must reply to them, but it is hard to do that and finish other tasks.

1. What do our brains get a lot of today?

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night. He threw the pieces at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other bats that are not their babies if they need help. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. They believed animals just acted in ways that could be measured. They thought animals did not have feelings or thoughts like humans. 

But now, this idea is changing. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals have feelings. This has led to new books about animal emotions, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a big question: Do animals have thoughts and feelings like humans? 

There is another question about conscience, which is a person’s sense of right and wrong. In a recent study with cows, cows that opened a locked gate for food seemed happier than cows that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? People agree on what they see, but they do not agree on what it means. 

Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks this is a big change in how we think about ethics. Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should think more about how animals think. He believes animals have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings on animals. 

These ideas may never agree because the main issue is not just science or morals, but philosophy. It is hard to define what consciousness is. Can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe did a study that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In his study, some starlings lived in nice cages, and some lived in small, bad cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms. But when only bad worms were given, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe thinks that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life.

Balcombe has worked with animal rights groups. He believes that in the future, people will look back and think it is wrong to treat animals badly, just like we think it is wrong to be racist. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating meat. 

If Balcombe were the only one with this idea, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning has written a book about animal behavior. He says we are changing how we think about animals. In the past, some people thought animals thought like humans, but now we are starting to think differently. This is a complicated topic, and it is important to listen to different opinions."

Critical thinking is how we think about what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a researcher, says that arguing can help us find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it can also make it hard to think deeply about problems. West says we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More information does not always mean we know more or make better choices. 

Reading books has gone down a lot, and this may hurt our critical thinking skills. Patricia Greenfield, a professor, believes that focusing more on videos and images can be a problem. People often do many things at once instead of focusing on one thing. We do not yet know exactly how technology affects our thinking. 

Technology can be both good and bad. For example, a computer game can help us think better or make it harder to think deeply. Reading online can help us analyze information, but clicking many links can distract us. Greenfield says that reading helps us think and use our imagination better than watching videos or playing games. However, some visual media can help us process information quickly. 

Many young people may not reach their full potential because they do not spend enough time thinking deeply. How we see technology affects how we think critically. James Paul Gee, a professor, says that people often think video games are bad for kids. But he believes they can be good for learning. Some games, like Sim City and Civilization, help kids learn to make decisions and think critically. These games let players explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life. 

In today’s world, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects our thinking.

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He writes about how we should live. His first book is about the good things in manual work. His latest book talks about how to deal with modern life. 

One day, while shopping, he saw ads on a credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. He thought that it is hard to avoid these ads. We often cannot choose what to think about because of these distractions. It is harder to think and remember conversations. People do not want to talk to strangers anymore because they are tired of being interrupted.

Crawford says we see the world through things like video games and phone apps. These things show us what we want, but they can take over our lives. Many office workers complain about emails but still check them in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to pay attention. 

Crawford believes that technology makes us focus too much on ourselves. We have many choices, and this makes it hard to control ourselves. We often prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. He thinks that by only using screens, we might lose important connections with other people.

He gives an example of his gym. Before, there was one music player for everyone. Now, people listen to their own music with ear buds. The gym used to be a place to meet others, but now it is not. Real connections often happen when people have different opinions and work things out.

Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, he thinks we should practice skills that help us connect with the real world. For example, cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers deal with real things. They use their judgment and work with others.

Crawford says that when we engage with the real world, we see that fake experiences are not as good. It is not necessary for everyone to become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment. Focusing on one thing can help us pay attention to other things too."

""What do you do for work?"" This is a common question. Many people answer it with a few words about their job. But if you are a philosopher, it can be a bit harder. Saying ""I am a philosopher"" can sound like you think you are better than others. This is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else. 

Philosophers often think about life and how people live. A famous philosopher named Aristotle said that thinking about life is very important. He believed that a thoughtful life is the best life. Another philosopher, Socrates, said that a life without reflection is not worth living. This means that we should think about our lives and the choices we make.

You do not need to read many books or be very smart to think about your life. It just means looking closely at your daily experiences. This can help you understand what is important to you. 

However, many philosophers work in universities and do not talk to regular people. This can make philosophy seem far away from real life. Philosophers often write for other experts, and this can make their ideas hard to understand. 

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I study ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. Ethics is important because it helps us think about our actions. For example, we can ask if downloading movies without paying is wrong. 

Philosophy helps us think about our lives and our beliefs. Sometimes we find out that we already know something, and other times we learn new things. By thinking about these ideas, we can help ourselves and others."

Many people love food. They think about what we eat and how we eat. This can make eating more enjoyable. In the past, when philosophers talked about food, they often used it to explain other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, they seemed to talk about food, but they were really discussing other topics.

One famous philosopher, Epicurus, said we should enjoy life and avoid pain. He talked about many things, but people now often think of him as someone who loved good food and drink. His name is used for restaurants and food shops because they want people to think their food is good.

Food is important in our lives. It comes from our history and is shared with our friends and family. We eat together, and this makes food special. We think about food more than other things we buy. After food is cooked, critics write and talk about it. Some people wonder why food critics are important. One philosopher said that they are good at describing how food tastes, not because they have special skills.

We often talk about art, like paintings or music, being beautiful, but we don’t usually say food is beautiful. Some philosophers believe that food should be talked about in the same way as art because it is important. However, food is eaten, and it does not last like art does.

There are also many questions about what we should eat. Should we eat organic food, free-range eggs, or vegetarian meals? Our choices show what we believe is right or wrong. Philosophers like to discuss these questions about food.

Cooking at home is different from cooking in a restaurant. When we cook at home, we share food with friends and family. But restaurant cooks work for their boss and have different rules. Their kitchens are not open to everyone.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" talks about how food can help people from different cultures understand each other. We can learn to enjoy other people's food and make friends by eating together. The essay has many interesting stories that make food philosophy fun to read about."

Rob Daviau is from the US. He makes special board games called ‘legacy’ games. When he was a child, he played board games, but he thought they were not fun or exciting anymore. He wanted to make board games better. He asked, “Can board games have a story? Can choices in one game affect the next game?” 

He changed a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made by players can change the game forever. Players might have to tear up cards or open new packets with new rules. The game is played over several sessions, and players can remember past events in the game. 

Rob also worked on a legacy version of a game called Pandemic. In Pandemic, players work together to cure diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. Pandemic Legacy was very popular, but SeaFall was a big test because it was a new game. In SeaFall, players are sailors exploring a new world.

Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make. They need to test the games to see how they work. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time to make the game right. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it can break, and they have to fix it.

Rob did not think legacy games would be very popular. He thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, really enjoy them. He thinks legacy games are a big step forward in game design. Players like to learn new things in these games.

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that even if players worry about changing the game, they still enjoy the adventure. He compared it to watching a new movie. Players want to have a fun experience, like in video games.

Rob Daviau wanted to tell stories in games. He used to want to be a TV writer. Matt Leacock, who made Pandemic, said making legacy games is like writing a book. You need to know how the story starts and ends, but you also need to plan the details.

Rob likes to see how others use his ideas, but he thinks players will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the company that made SeaFall, believes legacy games change how people think about board games.

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was fun and many people shared it online. 

People like to think that animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Some scientists believe that animals have feelings and can think about the past and future, just like humans. 

In the past, people thought animals were smart. For example, in medieval Europe, animals could be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, said that animals and humans are different, but only in degree, not kind. 

In the 20th century, many people thought animals were not very smart. They believed animals only acted because of rewards or punishments. This was a time when humans were harming animal homes and not caring for them. 

Now, scientists like Dr. Frans de Waal think we are starting to understand that animals are smarter than we thought. He says that animals have their own special skills. For example, squirrels can remember where they hide their nuts, which is something we might not be good at. 

Inky’s story is popular, but Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really knew how to escape to the ocean. He knows that stories about animals help people see how smart they can be. 

In one experiment, scientists found that capuchin monkeys can feel envy. When they saw other monkeys getting better food, they got very upset. A video of this experiment helped many people understand the findings better.

Robots are becoming very important in our world. They are not just in stories anymore; they are in factories and other places. Many people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do in the next 50 years. But many also believe their jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Robots will change many jobs soon.

For example, a company in Australia made a robot called Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. It would take two human workers a whole day to do this. Another robot, Tally, helps in supermarkets. It checks if the shelves have enough products and if they are priced correctly.

Some people say that robots will create new jobs for skilled workers, like technicians. But others worry that we need to keep human skills in jobs. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang studies how robots will change work. He says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and work well with humans. In three years, many big companies will have a special person to manage robots.

Zhang also says that in five years, salaries in the robot field will go up a lot, but there will not be enough skilled workers for these jobs. He believes that people need to learn new skills to keep their jobs. 

New robots will also be made for homes. These robots will be able to talk and help us in new ways. This is a big chance for companies, but it also brings challenges. We need new rules to keep people safe and protect their privacy.

With many jobs at risk, it is important to learn about robots and technology. Countries need more students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay strong in the future.

George Mallory was a climber. He was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He said, ""Because it’s there."" This means he wanted to climb just for the adventure. Many people wonder why anyone would want to climb mountains. Some climbers do it for fun and to face challenges.

A writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an essay in 1967 called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He talked about different types of climbing, from climbing small rocks to big mountains. Each type has its own rules. Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. But sometimes, climbing can be hard and dangerous, like when a storm traps them in a tent.

Joe Fitschen, another climber, asked a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He thinks climbing is part of being human. We like to take on challenges, even if they are risky. Brian Treanor, a teacher, wrote that climbing can help us learn important values like courage and respect for nature. 

Some expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson, said that climbing alone is harder and deserves more praise than climbing with a team or using special tools. But this idea can be dangerous for some climbers.

Climbing can also be a way to feel calm and focused. Many climbers talk about being in the moment or feeling peaceful while climbing. This is similar to some ideas in Zen philosophy, which helps people find peace of mind. 

So, there are many reasons why people like to climb mountains.

Alfred Brendel is a famous pianist. He played classical music for many years. He was very smart and serious. He played many piano pieces and recorded them. He did not teach many students. People who knew him said he was sometimes funny, but he did not show this in his concerts. He worked hard and traveled a lot.

A few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts. He wanted piano lessons. At first, Brendel did not want to teach him. He had very few students before. But when he heard Kit play, he changed his mind. Kit was about 14 years old and played very well. Brendel thought Kit was special and decided to teach him.

Now, Kit is 19 years old. He is always busy. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, and plays tennis. His mother is always with him. Kit also composes music. Brendel thinks it is important to learn to read music and to write music. He noticed that Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. Kit listens to Brendel and understands what he means.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He does not want people to think Kit is perfect. Some newspapers say Kit is the best young pianist, but Brendel thinks this is not good. Kit can play some pieces very well, but he still needs time to learn others.

Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is happy in his life after performing. He says when he was young, he did not want to be famous quickly. He wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When he was 50, he felt he had done many things, but he still wanted to do more. Now, he does not play as much, but he enjoys his new life."

When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My Grandad’s garden was by a river. It went down gently to the water. You could not touch the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a nice and quiet place. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He did not have a big greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows. They used plastic to cover broken glass. 

At home, my father was quiet. He was not serious all the time. He liked to say funny things. He often said, “It’s immaterial to me,” instead of “I don’t mind.” He left school without finishing and became a plumber. He did not love plumbing. He was not very ambitious, but he thought about moving to Canada with my mother. They did not go. 

My father was good at fixing things at home. He could build bookshelves and cupboards very well. My parents moved to a new house only once. My mother liked to change the furniture a lot. Just when you got used to one chair, she would bring in another. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it. My mother said they were too fancy, and they disappeared when I was at school. I never got to play the piano. My sister had lessons instead. When I asked my mother why, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”

I liked the river best of all places. I could imagine a different world there. I would take a fishing net and walk along the riverbank in my old sandals. I looked for a good spot to take off my sandals and find fish in the water. I tried to keep the fish at home, but they did not live long. 

I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed hard. One day, my father said, “There is a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.” He did not think I would be a gardener, but maybe he hoped I would be happy. I believe he saw how much I loved to garden, even if he did not like it himself."

Lawrence MacEwen is on his island, the Isle of Muck, in Scotland. I am with him. The wind is very strong, and it feels like we might be blown away. But Lawrence is not worried. He has a sheepdog named Tie. The wind is loud, but Lawrence is happy on his island.

Lawrence shows me his island. He points to another island called Eigg. He says the island next to it is Rum, and it rains a lot there. I see dark clouds over Rum. He also mentions another island called Soay. 

Suddenly, Lawrence says he needs to move his sheep. We walk down the hill. He tells me that the Isle of Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide. There are many geese here, and the MacEwen family has lived on this island for 3000 years. 

Lawrence calls Tie to help with the sheep, but Tie is not doing a good job. Lawrence is a little disappointed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin takes care of the cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can play outside and sail in the summer. 

Life on the island is not always easy. There is electricity only sometimes. One evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I see Mary making breakfast with a flashlight. There is also no mobile phone service. Mary tells me that some people go to the hill to use their phones, but most just put them away. 

Today, a boat brings groceries and three musicians. They come to play music in the tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on Soay without seeing it. Jenny had to manage it, but she did not know much about farms. She was good at typing.

I go to bed listening to the rain. I eat well because most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to get fresh fish from a fisherman named Sandy. I bring the fish back to Mary. By 7 pm, we eat the fish, and it is very tasty.

The next morning, I have to take a ferry to another island. Many ferries have been canceled because of the strong waves. If my ferry does not come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. I secretly hope that happens. 

**Questions:**

1. What is the name of the island where Lawrence lives?
2. What is the name of Lawrence's sheepdog?

The game design industry started with computer scientists and self-taught people. At first, many thought making video games was just a hobby for young people. Now, the video game industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into this industry. Making video games that are based on movies needs many people and a lot of skill and hard work.

Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is hard to work in big companies. But the industry needs game designers. They need not just the big bosses but also people who can design parts of the game. 

So, how can you start working in this industry? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks you can start by making games. You need to create something to get a job. Game design is not just a job; it is a way of life. 

Another expert, John Field, says it is not easy to do it alone. A good course in games can help you. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and then move up. They love all kinds of entertainment and art. They may have worked for a few years after school but know that games are what they want to do. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games.

Connections can also help you get a job in games. Many people forget this, but knowing the right people is important. 

The idea of a young boy playing video games all the time is old. Now, many adults play games too. Families often play games together on consoles. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth in games. Games are fun for many people and can also help you learn new things. He sees many new opportunities in this area.

He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend stopped wanting to play football because of this. I am happy that I still love football. When I score a great goal, some people say it is just luck, but I know it is because I practice a lot. The best players practice for many years. I learned how to play well, and I teach kids to enjoy learning. 

At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know school is important, but I only thought about football then. I want my son to enjoy learning too. We read him books, even if he is too young to sit still. I hope he does not just want to kick the books around.

When I started my football career, my manager helped young players like me. He did not make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to do well. I scored in my first game, but we lost. A TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us work harder. I trust my friends and family a lot. 

I have money, and I help my parents. I paid off their house and bought them a car. My mom loves her job as a hairdresser, and I want to help her. I have money, but it does not solve all my problems.

We lived at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He helped us find a cheap place to live. My father could not write in Los Angeles because he did not like it there. Sam was worried about losing money and clients.

In the summer, the beach was empty because of the sea fog. Few people came to Reef Point. The road was not nice, and a better place, La Carmella, was nearby. People with money went there. Only those who had no money or loved surfing came to Reef Point. But now, in the hot weather, many people were at the beach. 

My father was busy every day trying to write a script. I often went to the beach with my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we did not have a dog. Rusty came to us and did not leave. I tried to send him away, but he always came back. One day, I gave him some water. My father did not like Rusty at first, but he did not really chase him away.

Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes he found things that were not his, like a sneaker or a beach towel. I had to give these back to their owners. Rusty liked to swim with me, even though I could swim better and faster. 

One day, after swimming, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I stayed at the beach. The sun was setting, and it was getting cooler. We watched the surfers. They were very good at surfing. One surfer was special. She was better than the others. 

She came to me and said, “Hi! Why didn’t you join us?” I replied, “I don’t have a surfboard.” She said, “You could get one.” I answered, “I have no money.” Then she asked, “You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” I said, “No, I live here.” She asked, “Is your father American?” I said, “No. He came here to write a film script from a book he wrote.” She was surprised and asked, “What’s his name?” I said, “Rufus Marsh.” She said, “Do you mean, Tall as the Morning?” I nodded.

After some time, an announcement said there was a problem with the computer system. The people waiting became unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted to get on the ship. Violet felt like she made a mistake coming on this cruise. 

She looked in her bag for her phone but could not find it. This made her more upset. She needed her phone to call the taxi company to see if she left it in the taxi. But she could not call because all her numbers were in her phone. 

Behind her, a nice couple was waiting. Violet asked them if she could use their phone to call her son Harry. She left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, if she could check for her phone. If it was not in her flat, she would have a problem because she needed to find numbers in New York. 

Finally, the line started to move, and Violet gave her travel documents to the worker. When she got inside the ship, it looked like a fancy hotel but not very nice. There were shiny things and big lights everywhere. 

Violet followed the signs to the elevators. The elevator was full of tired people with their bags. When the elevator stopped, everyone got out, and Violet finally reached her floor. 

She was happy to see that her room had a balcony, just like she wanted. She had worried about this, but now she felt relieved. She had paid a lot of money to make sure she had a nice view of the sea."

John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Vivian Maier, a street photographer. Maloof has collected many things from Maier's life, like her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives. He also has some movies and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked at all the things he found. He felt lucky. He said, ""When I bought this, I had no idea what it was."" Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are trying to learn more about Maier's life. They talked to families that knew her when she worked as a nanny and to people who developed her film.

Vivian Maier was born in 1926 in New York. She lived in France when she was a child. In 1951, she came back to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person but always had a camera. She wore big coats, wide hats, and strong shoes. Maren Baylaender, who knew her, said, ""On her day off, she had her camera and we didn’t see her until late at night."" Maier liked movies and had strong opinions about them.

Maier took pictures of women, children, old people, and the poor. Larry Silverman, a photography expert, said, ""Vivian has many interesting pictures."" He wonders if she learned from other photographers or if she had her own style. Maloof often thinks about all the negatives he has. He did not care much about photography until he found Maier's work. Now, he takes pictures too. He said, ""I realized that the people and street scenes were more important than I thought."" Maloof wants to share Vivian Maier's name and work with the world."

Eleanor Catton is a writer from New Zealand. Her book is called *The Luminaries*. It is a big book with more than 800 pages. The story takes place in New Zealand in the 1860s. There are many crimes, and twelve men try to solve them. 

Eleanor is young, and she became famous quickly. She told a funny story about when she was stopped at the airport. The officer asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed her book and the officer asked, ""What is it about?"" This is a hard question for a writer.

Eleanor wanted to write a murder mystery. She said the past helped her make the story more interesting. She wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good part in the story. 

When I asked her how it feels to be successful, she said it feels nice because people in New Zealand feel proud of her. She also said it is annoying when people think her book is not serious. 

Eleanor wanted to write the book in a special way. Each part of the book is shorter than the part before it. She said it makes the story go faster. She wanted readers to notice this if they wanted to, but it was not very important.

Even with this special way of writing, *The Luminaries* is still a fun murder mystery. Eleanor said she did not know how the story would end when she started writing. She liked to create problems in the story and then find creative ways to solve them.

Eleanor loves TV shows and thinks about how her book has exciting moments and different points of view. I asked if she would like to write for TV. She said that could be cool. 

Eleanor is happy when she talks about writing and New Zealand. She feels different when she visits other places. She understands why writers leave New Zealand to find new ideas. But for now, she wants to stay in New Zealand and write more books.

When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage. He also liked to play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has made guitars by hand. Jonny says, “I love the guitar. You can make a beautiful sound with just two pieces of wood. Different woods make different sounds. It is amazing!”

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven years old. When he was sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. He did not want to save money for it. Instead, he decided to make one himself. He studied how guitars work and how different shapes and woods change the sound.

Jonny built his first bass guitar, but he did not think about making guitars as a job. He also liked painting and sculpture. After school, he went to university to study architecture because he liked design. But halfway through, he left school. He realized he wanted to build guitars. He thought it was a good job because people use guitars.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows to earn more money. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials. But as he became known as a good guitar maker, he could charge more money. Even now, after almost forty years, he says he is still just getting by. He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his money.

In the beginning, Jonny worked hard to get people to know him. He went to music festivals and let musicians try his guitars. He also learned how to price his guitars because he did not know how to do this at first.

Jonny thinks it is easier for new guitar makers today. When he started, many people thought only American guitars were good. But now, people know that UK-made guitars are also very good. Jonny believes new guitar makers should take classes to learn. But he also thinks it is important to learn by trying things on your own. He says, “If you make mistakes, you learn. If you only learn from someone else, you only know one way.”"

When people talk in English, they often start with the weather. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said that when two English people meet, they first talk about the weather. This is still true today. Many people wonder why English people talk about the weather so much. Some think it is because they really like the weather. 

An American writer, Bill Bryson, says that English weather is not very interesting. He thinks that in other places, the weather is more exciting with storms and big changes. But a British broadcaster, Jeremy Paxman, disagrees. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. 

I think both Bryson and Paxman miss the real reason why English people talk about the weather. When they say things like, “Nice day, isn’t it?” or “Ooh, isn’t it cold?” they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are ways to start a conversation or fill a pause. 

Talking about the weather is like a way for English people to connect with each other. There are three main times when they talk about the weather: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a quiet moment. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather all the time. They might start with a weather greeting, then talk a little more about the weather, and go back to it if there is a pause. This makes it look like they are very interested in the weather.

1. What do English people often talk about when they meet?
2. Who said that English people first talk about the weather?
3. What does Bill Bryson think about English weather?
4. What does Jeremy Paxman think about English weather?

She wanted to tell them how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall that is 120 km long and 5 meters high a long time ago. The students were excited about this trip. They chose it instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. But they wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice felt she did not have good answers. 

Alice could not find a good book about the history of the wall, so she decided to write one herself. She stopped teaching after 31 years and became a writer in 2001. Alice felt nervous but excited about this new job. She said, “Teaching is like acting. Writing is exciting, but it is not so tiring.” 

Alice wants to write books for children that are different from many books today. She thinks many books for young people are sad or very fantasy, like Harry Potter. Alice wants her books to be real but also fun. 

Alice always taught English and History together. She loves to see when children go from being bored to being interested. She thinks it is her job to make learning fun. 

Alice started writing because her two sons were leaving home, and her head teacher suggested she take a writing course. At first, she did not want to go. But she had to send a story to the teachers before she could join the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours, she had 30 pages and sent it in. She was accepted into the course. 

During the course, other students liked her story and told her to publish it. Alice asked her school head teacher for a year off to write her first book. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helps her with editing her work. He changes sentences and helps make the story better. Alice thinks they work well together."

To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, to race. Jonny is older and a champion triathlete. They would race in a special way: Jonny would drive a car on the road, and Alistair would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

“I’m excited!” said Jonny at the start line. “I have never done this before. The views are beautiful, and I will be warm in the car.” Alistair was ready too, wearing warm cycling clothes. He said, “I have seen Jonny drive. I am not sure he will win. I might stop for tea!”

The race started at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, which is very high up. Jonny drove the car, and Alistair rode his bike up the hill. They would see each other at the finish line. 

Jonny felt good at first, but then he saw a big tractor on the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman. “If Alistair wins, it is because of this farmer!” After the tractor, Jonny drove on. 

Alistair was having a hard time. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill. Some sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top of the hill and started to ride fast.

In the car, Jonny had to go slowly through narrow roads and small villages. He was trying to get to the finish line quickly. 

At the end, Jonny drove fast, and Alistair rode hard. When Alistair reached the finish line, he asked, “Is Jonny here?” The crowd said no. Alistair raised his arms and shouted, “Yes!”

When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the soft grass. You throw it up to serve and hit it. You can hear your own shots. The grass is nice, and the stadium is old and special. The players wear white, and the crowd is respectful. This quiet helps me play better. 

In a tennis match, I try to focus only on the game. When I win a point, the crowd cheers and claps. I hear them, but it feels far away. I do not think about the many people watching me on TV. I am playing Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final. This is the biggest match of my life. I always wanted to play at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me it is the most important tournament. When I was 14, I dreamed of playing there and winning.

Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer two times. In 2006, I was happy just to be there. Federer won easily. But in 2007, I was very sad. I knew I could have played better. I cried for half an hour after that match. Losing hurts, especially when you have a chance to win. Toni usually does not comfort me, but after 2007, he told me not to cry. He said there would be more chances to play at Wimbledon. I thought this was my last chance. I know that a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it.

In 2008, I had another chance. I felt ready to win. The night before the final, I had dinner with my family and friends. We did not talk about the match because I was already thinking about it in my mind. I wanted to keep that space for myself until the match started."

A young English woman named Jane Goodall came to Africa in April 1957. In her first letter home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always wanted."" She spent most of her life in Africa. Jane was a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Jane became famous because of articles and TV shows about her work with chimpanzees. She wrote many books, including children's books and a popular book called In the Shadow of Man. This book has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. 

Many stories have been told about her life, but they often focus on her as a girl who loved adventure or a woman who wanted to work with animals. These stories do not show all the important things she has done. Jane Goodall is a very important scientist because she helped us understand how chimpanzees live and feel. 

Before Jane's work, people thought chimpanzees were very dangerous. No one knew that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. We also did not know that chimpanzees have feelings like humans and live in social groups like us. Jane's book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe, is very important for studying chimpanzees. 

Jane Goodall changed how we study animals. She helped us understand that chimpanzees are our closest relatives. Even as a child, Jane showed her love for animals. When she was five years old, she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. One day, she crawled into a henhouse and waited quietly for five hours to see how it happened. This was the start of her journey as a biologist."

Shirley Ford is a voice actor. She can make many different voices. In one hour, she talks like a funny 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. People know her voices from children’s TV shows and cartoons. 

Shirley says, “I just did a voice for a video about back injuries. I had to learn many medical words.” She explains that doing voiceovers is not easy. Many actors think they can do funny voices, but it is more than that. You must make the words exciting for people who cannot see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they often do not get the job because they are used to acting with their whole body.

After school, Shirley took a drama course. She wanted to be a regular actor. Sometimes, she sang for TV ads. One day, the man at the recording studio asked her to try out for a rabbit in a cartoon. She thought it was silly, but she tried and got the part. Shirley found out she could do voices and liked voiceover work. 

In her second film, she played the main character and also her brother and mother. Women actors often do the voices for small boys and girls because their voices are higher. It is hard to find child actors, so companies like to use adult women instead. 

Shirley learned to make different sounds and to watch children’s TV to get new voices. She enjoys working on cartoons the most. She says, “Sometimes, I have to sound happy about things I don’t care about, but I learned to smile when I talk. It makes my voice sound bright.” 

Shirley says it is hard to get voiceover jobs. A good showreel, which is a recording of what you can do, is very important. She believes it is good to invest in a strong showreel. There are agencies that help voice actors make them. 

Shirley worked hard to be successful. She says, “You must make your showreel and show it to film and TV companies. You must practice your voices and never give up.” 

For people who want to be voice actors, Shirley suggests going to special workshops. She loves voices and becomes the characters she plays. She says, “If I do an American voice, I might talk like that for hours or days. My children are used to me talking in different voices.”"
35,"Text: ""People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because many kids dream of being cartoonists, like they dream of being race car drivers. But most people stop dreaming and choose other jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make money by drawing funny pictures. But some people do this. 

Many cartoonists wanted to be cartoonists for a long time. I loved comic strips when I was a kid. I drew pictures for my school and everyone knew me as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college. After college, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live.

You don’t need a university degree to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a lot of money or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But it is not easy to be a cartoonist. It is better to have other skills too. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also written and designed. I take any job because I can learn from all kinds of work. It helps to be smart and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. Now, most cartoonists have to sell their own work. If you are good at selling, you will do better. I have seen cartoonists who are not very creative but are good at business do better than very talented artists who do not know how to sell.

Some people worry too much about others stealing their ideas. They are scared to show their work. To protect your drawings, you can write a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright’ and put your name and the date next to it. But really, it is more likely that no one will care about your work. If someone takes your cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster. It can be a lucky chance!"""

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house. I was cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar. My dad gave it to me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice black guitar. I usually do not like to throw things away, but I did this time. I took it to the dump. Just as I was going to put it in the rubbish, a young man came to me. He looked confused and said, “You are not going to throw that away, are you?” I said yes, and he asked if he could have it. I said yes, and we went our own ways. 

After that, I felt sad about giving it away. A few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean. Ten years later, he found it in a fish at a restaurant. I felt like that when I opened the email. It was from a man named Keith Rushton. He said, “I have your electric guitar.” 

He found my guitar after it was sold many times. He saw my name on a label on the back of the guitar. He used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and wanted to sell it back to me. I was very happy. I would have given him anything, but his price was fair. I remembered how my dad liked to put name labels on my things, even my guitar. 

My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar. In the 1970s, many people liked classical guitar. I loved the sound; it was calm and gentle. But I did not get better at it. So, I switched to the electric guitar. At that time, punk music was popular. People who could not play well could still be rock stars. 

When I opened the box with my old guitar, I remembered my birthday in 1978. My parents smiled and gave me the guitar. When I held it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up. I put a strap on my shoulder because you play electric guitar while standing. My fingers knew what to do. I could not draw the chords, but my hands remembered. My fingers felt the pain of pressing the strings to play. 

The electric guitar is not just for one person. Now that I am learning it again, I want to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone. Maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who want to play. We could call ourselves “The Regainers”!"

People are talking a lot about sleep. I wrote a book called Insomniac. It is about people who cannot sleep. I think sleep is very important for our minds and bodies. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is. It is good that people are talking about sleep now. 

But what about dreams? I do not hear much about dreams. When you wake up early, you lose sleep. This lost sleep is mostly REM sleep. REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement. This is when we have the most dreams. A good sleeper spends about one-fourth of their sleep time in REM. If a person lives for 90 years, they will spend six or seven years dreaming in REM.

When scientists take away REM sleep, people dream more the next night. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, scientists found REM sleep. Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, said that dreams help us understand our minds. But later studies showed that this is not so simple. Now, scientists study dreams more for their physical reasons than for their psychological reasons.

Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist, says that scientists do not agree on many things about dreams. Dreams are important. A study by P.F. Pagel found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. This means that creative people use their dreams more. 

Stickgold says that dreams help us think in new ways. They help us connect old and new ideas. For example, when people wake up from REM sleep and think of a word, their ideas are more original than when they wake from other sleep stages. They think of surprising connections. 

I write better when I wake up from strong dreams. Even a bad dream can help me think better. On those days, I can write quickly. I do not know how it works, but it helps. 

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We all need to think well in our lives. We need to dream to help us think creatively and solve problems with others. This is why dreams are important. 

**Questions:**

1. What is the name of the book the author wrote?
2. What does REM stand for?
3. How long do people spend dreaming if they live for 90 years?
4. Who said that dreams help us understand our minds?
5. What do creative people do with their dreams?"

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London. She moved to a small town by the sea in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea. There are many empty frames on the walls and pictures of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist. She can paint copies of famous paintings very well. 

""I don’t keep my own paintings,"" Susie says. ""As soon as I finish them, I sell them."" Many people want her work. In her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted many famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies look so real that experts sometimes think they are the original paintings. 

Her copies can sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she works on them. Susie does not tell the names of her clients, but they include art galleries and private collectors. Some collectors want to show off their art. One famous buyer likes to say he has a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. 

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies a painting, she tries to make it look real. She puts her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as an original. Susie knows people who have done this, but she does not want to. She is not very rich, but her life is better now. 

Before being a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator at a botanical garden. She did this for many years and learned a lot. She had to be very careful and get things right. She is happy she found a job that pays better. 

When young artists ask her for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well. She has studied a lot to do her job. She can draw many things, but she likes to copy French impressionist paintings the most. 

Some people think modern art is easy. But Susie says impressionist painters worked quickly and carefully. It is hard to do both. 

People wonder why Susie does not create her own art. She says her work is the result of many years of practice, and she makes a good living. She has tried to paint her own things, but they did not turn out well. Susie is a perfectionist."

Ellen MacArthur loved the sea. When she was a child, she wanted to be the fastest person on the water. She spent a lot of time sailing around the world. Her boat was very important to her. When she was on land, she felt bored and wanted to be back on the ocean.

One time, she came second in a big race called the Vendée Globe. After the race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She lived in this boat for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, even how many paper towels she needed. She had special food and a small stove. She took care of her boat because it was her home.

Ellen thinks the world is like a boat. It is small and beautiful, but it can be damaged. She had an important moment on a trip to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. She helped with a bird study there. This made her think about how people take too much from nature and do not care enough.

When I visited Ellen, she was finishing a call about saving the planet. She said we need to use less coal, oil, and gas because they are running out. At first, she told people to use less, but now she talks about re-using things. She visits factories and talks to people about how we can use resources better.

Ellen started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. This charity helps young people think about a better future. She misses sailing and the adventure of being at sea. She feels connected to everything when she sails. Now, her message is different. It is not just about being the fastest sailor; it is about helping the planet.

Jordan wants to inspire kids to go outside and climb. Jordan's team is his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and another mountain called Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Few people do this before they are thirty years old. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains. 

Some famous climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say a young climber may be strong, but they worry if a teenager is emotionally strong enough. They also think a young person may not have enough experience to climb safely. Paul says they hear this criticism, but they focus on their plans. He believes their experience as climbers will help. He sees Jordan getting stronger and more grown-up.

Paul says this project is not about making him famous. At first, Jordan wanted to do this later in life, but they decided to do it now. They talk to Jordan to make sure he still wants to climb. When asked why he wants to do this, Jordan says, ""I just focus on achieving my goal."" 

Today, many people want to be the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. This makes Jordan's climb more interesting. He knows he must share his adventure online and give interviews. He has to do something special, like climbing Everest. Paul says if Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, they will stop the project and go to the gym.'"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Many people know pop music groups, but not many know about classical music. I am studying music at school, but my friends do not know much about classical music either. Most people do not buy classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets were for classical music. This is surprising.

Many older people think teenagers like TV and video games too much. They think this is why teenagers do not like classical music. But I think classical music is just not interesting for most teenagers. Some teenagers do like classical music and go to concerts, but they are few.

I play music in an orchestra, but I do not listen to much classical music. I like many types of music, but I listen to classical music very little. 

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, classical music has many changes in speed and mood. Teenagers like fast music. Also, experts say teenagers can only pay attention for about three minutes. Most classical music pieces are longer than that, but pop songs are short. Pop music is easy to listen to, while classical music needs more time and focus. 

Pop music talks about things that are important to teenagers. Classical music is powerful, but it does not talk about teenage issues. 

In the past, families played music together at home. Now, we can find any music we want online. You rarely hear classical music in shops. Some teachers say more people are going to classical concerts now, but I think most of them are not teenagers. 

In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but the audience is mostly older people. If your parents like something, you might not want to like it too. Some people say schools do not help teenagers like classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestra. They practice a lot. They like classical music when they play it, but not when they listen to it. When we want to relax, we usually listen to pop music.

42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I will make you sorry I came here,” she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too, so she did not hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t care if she did. Her mother knew how Bonnie felt. 

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden in the trees. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gym, riding centre… “Riding centre,” said Bonnie, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” said her mother. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you would walk with me instead of behind me,” said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she did not expect Bonnie to do it.

A few minutes later, Mrs. Wyndham was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she said to herself. “I will be thrown out soon anyway,” she said to the door, “so why not go now?” She left the building and went to the riding centre.

There was a nice old building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She walked carefully to the horses. Bonnie treated horses with respect. The horses were well cared for. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one. “I know what you are doing here,” she said to a small pony, touching its nose. 

Then she saw the next horse. “But aren’t you the best!” she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we have met before,” she said, stroking his neck. His name was Maverick. Bonnie wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. 

The room with the riding equipment was open. Happy, she put a saddle on Maverick’s back and forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. At her old school, they called her Queen Bee, and she laughed when she remembered it. “You are the best horse I have ever ridden, Maverick,” she said. “I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else.” 

She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She went around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and a little breeze made her cheek feel warm. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."

I met Cody Simpson before. He is a quiet and confident person. Cody is 15 years old and comes from Australia. He has made many popular songs. 

Cody started playing guitar when he was six years old. He began writing songs when he was seven. He loved swimming and surfing. These were his favorite activities. When he was 13, he went to high school and posted some videos online. 

These videos changed everything for him. He posted a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Many fans wanted to see more videos. Cody recorded more videos at home. People loved them. 

Cody was also a good swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches. But then, record companies wanted him. He had to choose: stay in Australia and keep swimming or move to the US to make music. Cody decided to move. 

He said it was hard to choose a career at such a young age. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving. They were surprised because he is a quiet kid. 

Cody moved with his family to the US. His family is not in the spotlight, but they support him. He thinks it is important to have good people around him. 

Sometimes, Cody worries about his little brother and sister. His brother is eight years old and travels with him. Cody thinks about how this affects his brother. But his family always supports him. 

Cody believes that success comes from saying ""yes"" to new opportunities, even if it is scary. He is now visiting many countries and playing for many fans. He knows this success may not last forever."

I jumped out of bed and looked out the window. I saw the river. There was a crack in the ice shining in the sunlight. I looked at the sandbags. They help stop the water from flooding when the ice melts. My back hurt from moving the sandbags. Last week, I worked with many people in the town for a long time. I wanted to show I could help. My grandfather did not notice much. 

I looked at the river. There was dark water from the factory. The ice was on both sides of the water. I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit. I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. He was trying to stand on the ice near the warm water. I zipped up my wetsuit and put on my kayaking jacket. I checked my pocket for my lucky chain. It is a silver chain my grandfather gave me. Only my mom, my grandfather, and I know about it. I also have my grandfather's diary from his trip to South America. I read it before I sleep. 

I went to the kitchen. “Good morning, Rex,” my mom said. She smiled at me as I took a banana. “You are up early for Saturday. I will make brunch after your training. Be careful.” “Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hall and almost bumped into my grandfather. “Watch where you are going!” he shouted. “Where are you going?” “Sorry, Grandpa. I am going kayaking.” He should know that by now. 

“Why train? You did not win the competition,” he said. His words hurt me. I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went to the bathroom and slammed the door. My mom smiled at me. “Don’t worry about him. He’s…” “...not himself right now,” I said. I wanted to say he is always like this, but I didn’t. I remember when I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of his trips. Those pictures are still on his wall with his medals. But I do not go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now. I hope to be in National Geographic one day. 

My mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training, Rex. I admire your hard work, even in the cold!” I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went outside. I walked quickly to the boathouse."

Mum took Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, there was a painting. It was not in a frame and it looked like Grandpa’s work, but it was different and not finished. 

“Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was painting.” Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in it. It was not a river she knew, maybe it was a made-up river. The picture was strange and beautiful. The riverbank was very small, with a little green. The river looked pale and went to a hidden sea. There were no animals, no birds, and no people. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn after summer.

Mum said, “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed she was excited. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa wrote. Jess read them: “River Boy.” The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 

Jess looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” 

“Exactly. It’s strange for him to be so specific. Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it once.” 

“Mum! You should have known better.” 

“I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such a strange picture. You can guess what he said.” 

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would say, “It’s not the artist’s job to explain a painting. Each picture has its own meaning, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t.” 

Mum laughed. “He said something like that. I was hoping you might know something about this painting because you inspire him.” 

“Inspire?” 

“Someone who helps an artist.” Jess knew the word. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint. But he never said it was about her. She thought it meant a goddess, not a person. It was hard to think anyone could inspire Grandpa. 

“He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He has painted all his life.”"

This morning, I woke up and did not want to cut a hole in my carpet. I did not mean to do it. Maybe it was an accident. I could have tripped over my bed with a knife in my hand. The knife might have gone into the carpet by itself. I did not want to damage the carpet. I did not wake up and think, ""Today I will cut my carpet."" It seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that. This happens to me a lot. 

I was not thinking about cutting the carpet. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My grandma gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small and painted white with pink and blue flowers. Grandma kept pretty things in it. I keep my shells and stones there. I was very happy when she gave it to me!

The cabinet is a corner cabinet. It has to go in a corner. My bedroom is small and has only two corners. The big bedroom is for my parents, the back room is for my sister Angela, and the little room is for my brother Tom. My room is very small, like a broom cupboard. 

Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have Tom's room. But Angela is only fifteen, so I think I will be in my small room for a long time. I like my little bedroom. It is cozy, like a nest. The roof is sloped, and the window is low. 

The problem is, I do not have enough corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Grandma’s cabinet in the space between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. I thought, if I cannot cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. My dad says to ""think outside the box,"" and that is what I was trying to do!"
47,"Text: 'The book ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of tiny people. They live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show from the book, I knew it would be hard. People who love the book have strong ideas about it. I used the original drawings from the book because I did not want people to say I did it wrong. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' view, not from the humans' view. This made filming more difficult. 

The most important thing was to show the right size. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans. So, when we filmed the Borrowers walking or going on their missions, we had to be ten times further away than normal. The crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low, about 15 centimeters high, to show the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for special shots. 

One big problem was to make the shadows look right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We made a special way to do this. After the show, the famous director George Lucas called me to ask how I did it. 

We built only one set, which was the Borrowers' home under the floor. It had big objects to make the actors look small. It was very fun. I remember the coins; they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often stopped filming because the crew laughed so much. In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses. They said it was very scary, so they did not have to act. 

It was important to me to get the costumes right. I had them made from heavy material so they looked like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to move. She could not sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor wore trousers made from a rug because normal fabric looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming. I don’t think they liked the costumes! 

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to act with things that were not really there. I drew pictures of every scene to show how they should look. I drew 2,000 pictures in total. They were not perfect, but they helped. We did not have enough money for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. 

We had to work fast. One time, I filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the show was successful in showing the magic of the books.'"

Mom stops the car at my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around, worried about reporters, but there are none. I know things will get crazy soon. There will be fake smiles and people wanting things from me. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses my cheek before I get out of the car. Now I am alone at this new school. But I wanted this. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. The band is here for a short time, but I am staying for good. I want to meet normal kids.

She types my last name on her computer. Not many people know my last name because my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she says. She gives me my schedule. My first class is English Literature. I like English. I will be late because my class is on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t get lost.

She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After that, she lets us talk to each other!

“Why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few answers. I could say I want a normal life away from cameras and reporters. Or I could say what my dad said: “We need a change, Desert.” “My dad had to move,” I tell her. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out soon, but I want to pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” She seems nice."

Today, many American teenage girls have a lot of responsibilities. They are expected to be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, and help others. They also need to do well in school. Being a teenager in America is not easy. 

Teenagers have a lot of homework, tests, and activities after school. They also have jobs and chores at home. Kristen Loose, a teenager, says that people forget how much pressure teenagers feel. Some people think teenagers are lazy or disrespectful. Kristen believes this is not fair. 

Many people think teenagers only watch TV or use their phones all the time. Kristen says this is not true. She uses her phone to help her with school and to stay in touch with people. Today, students can do their homework anywhere because of phones and tablets. They can listen to lessons while going to school. 

Teenagers often start their day very early, around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., and they finish their day late, sometimes after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation says that only 20 percent of teenagers sleep enough at night. 

Lindamarie Olsen, another teenager, says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. This is not a lot of time. She does not spend much time on social media or TV. Instead, she likes to help others by volunteering. She believes that many people think teenagers only care about themselves, but she enjoys helping her school and community. 

In the future, teenagers will still work hard and show that they can make a difference in the world."

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers. They live in Bishop, a small mountain town in the US. This town is near big mountains and nature. The club has sent over fifty balloons into the sky, about 35 km high. They do this to learn about space and have fun.

One weekend in spring, I joined them. They were going to send a balloon up to see shooting stars. Shooting stars are bright lights in the sky when a rock or metal comes into the Earth's atmosphere. 

As it got dark, the teenagers put a soft lunch box on the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a tool to measure how high the balloon goes, and a thermometer to check the temperature. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside to find the lunch box later. They used a gas tank to fill the balloon, which got very big, like a small car. An older boy drove a long way to get the gas tank.

Finally, it was time to let the balloon go. They counted down: ""Five, four, three, two, one,"" and the balloon went up into the sky. Some of the kids ran and used flashlights to see it for as long as they could. Then the balloon disappeared.

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets and looked at the clear sky. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. One girl said, ""We are the only ones talking."" Another girl whispered, ""I know."" Then, a shooting star went across the sky.

As the balloon went up, it got bigger and bigger until it popped. A parachute helped the lunch box come back down safely. The next day, the students used the GPS trackers to find it. It was not easy to get back, but that was part of the fun. The lunch box usually lands in a place with no people around.

The leader of the group said, ""Recovering the lunch box is a big part of the project."" They had lost only two lunch boxes in 53 tries. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km from Bishop. The team had to drive a long way to find it. They had to decide if they should drive or walk to get it. It could be hard if the lunch box was on a high mountain or in a tall tree.

The leader said, ""These students know this area well. What is hard for some people is normal for them."" It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not catch any shooting stars. This was a little sad, but it gave them a chance to talk about science and share their adventure stories."

Chloe Morgan did not like science when she was younger. This changed when she was fifteen. Her younger brother liked dinosaurs, and she helped him with a school project. She found an article about new dinosaur discoveries, and it excited her. She wanted to learn more about dinosaurs.

Chloe met a palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius. He was young and famous. At first, she was nervous to talk to him. She thought he might think she was just a kid asking too many questions. But he was nice and listened to her.

Chloe thinks movies like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs. But she feels that movies do not show palaeontologists correctly. They often show them as strange or funny people. Chloe says her job is very different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, and writes about science. She also wants to help people understand science better, especially young people. She believes talking about dinosaurs can make kids interested in nature and science.

Chloe worked on a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She helped make sure the dinosaurs looked real and were from the same time. The show was popular because it showed new information about dinosaurs. 

Chloe thinks dinosaurs are still interesting because they make us curious. They remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. Palaeontology, the study of dinosaurs, is like traveling back in time.

When you travel by car with your family, you often ask, ""Are we there yet?"" Even if you are six years old, you know you are not there. When you arrive, it is not ""there"" anymore; it is ""here."" 

Kids often ask this question many times. Parents hear it a lot on long trips. Kids might think it is hard, but they can relax in the back seat. They can watch movies, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the nice views outside the window. 

In the front seat, mom or dad drives the car. They give juice boxes and cookies and change the radio. They help make the trip nice. 

But sometimes, kids fight in the back seat. For example, my younger brother, Tim, puts his foot on my side of the seat. I do not like this, so I put my foot on his side. Then we start to fight. Mom or Dad tell us to stop and stay in our own seats. 

Later, I try to read, but I feel something on my arm. Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He is not touching me, but it makes me angry. 

Dad has ways to deal with us. When we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he sometimes says, ""Yes, we are here. Get out of the car."" But we are still driving. 

You know you are really ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and go far away from the kids. So remember, if mom and dad are still close, the answer is: no, you are not there yet.

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi want people to enjoy their time and come back again. 

Zuzi says they started this café because they love board games. She thinks many people spend too much time on their phones and computers. They want to help people talk and have fun together. 

In their café, people play games called ‘Eurogames’. These games are about simple things like farming and building. One popular game is called The Settlers of Catan. In this game, players build homes on an island and trade things with each other. Everyone can join in and have fun together. 

Another game is called Pandemic. In this game, players work as a team to solve problems. It was made by Matt Leacock, who loves board games. He wanted to make games that make people feel good, whether they win or lose. 

Matt remembers when he was a child. He loved getting board games for his birthday, but sometimes he was disappointed when they were not fun. So, he and his uncle tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular and has a lot of stories in it. 

Today, many people play video games on their phones and computers. This has helped more people enjoy board games too. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that many people now like to play games. 

Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many play online and do not see each other. Some of these people want to play games with friends in person again. 

In John and Zuzi's busy café, board games are more than just fun. They help people connect and enjoy time together in the real world."

Jamie Scott is a musician from the UK. He has written many popular songs. His story shows that hard work is important in music, even if you start slowly. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him learn to play the guitar. He only listened to local radio when he was young, which influenced his music. He was 12 years old when he heard a modern song for the first time.

When he was younger, Jamie played tennis at a high level. But he liked music more. He spent his lunch breaks in the music room at school. At 17, he left school to become a performer. He worked with a friend who played guitar but did not want to be a performer. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to make music. His dad said he had 18 months to succeed, or he would need to find a job.

At 19, Jamie got a deal with a music publisher after writing one song. But the music labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to stop working with his friend. He had some hard times with a record label in the UK. He asked to leave and joined another label to make a new album, but he did not become famous right away.

Jamie believes he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time as an artist. But as a songwriter, he felt he was in the right place. He helps new artists and wants to write big songs that many people will listen to. He tells artists that it is okay to want to write popular music. He wants to create great songs that can be number one on the charts.

Jamie is honest about his goals. He wants to write the best music and make classic pop songs. He focuses on making good music instead of worrying about what others think."

Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people do not know him if they do not watch videos of bike tricks. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places like roofs and walls to land safely in other strange places. People film his tricks and put them online.

I met Tony in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys know him well. Some older people also come to see him and call him ""an absolute legend."" After watching him, I agree. At first, I was not sure about him, but I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, he tells us what he will do, and sometimes I think he cannot do it. But when I tell him he did a great job, he does not seem very happy.

Tony says he does not like being famous. He finds it hard to talk to fans. He prefers to do things instead of just talking about them. This is funny because he is famous because of social media and cameras. He says, ""This technology helps people like me earn money."" He feels that many people are always looking at their phones, and he does not like that.

Tony makes good money from his videos. He has learned that two things help a child become a great athlete: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are very important, even more than talent. The more dangerous the sport, the more mental strength you need. 

In the park, Tony fell a few times on some easy obstacles. But he got up and kept trying until he did it right. Some people think he is a hero, but others say he is too risky. He says, ""People who say this may care, but they do not understand. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and do not know the sport well. I get advice from experts to stay safe.""

Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He says, ""People are different. Some are not scared, and they should not do these sports. It is smart to know the dangers. Some people cannot get over their fear, but I can. I feel scared, but I find a way to jump. I am not addicted to risk. I plan a lot and sometimes ride around to get ready before a new jump. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus, I will be fine.""

For her new challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 metres above the ground, between two tall towers. There was no safety net. She wore a belt that was attached to another wire above her. To help her balance, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. She had some circus skills, but high-wire walking was very different. Helen said, “The training was a shock. I didn’t know I needed to be so strong.” Every day, she started at 8 am. First, she ran up a steep hill. Then, she did exercises for one hour. After that, she practiced on the wire for another hour. She also learned how to fall safely on the wire. When she fell, it hurt a lot. But she tried to stay positive. If she was nervous, the wire would shake!

On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths and moved slowly on the wire. The walk was 150 metres long and took 15 minutes. After, she said, “That was the scariest thing I’ve done. I’m glad it’s over!” But Helen is not done. She is planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"

Jeff had written a book about his travels in Canada in a very old car. He loved cars and worked on racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work. He also used it to go to Amsterdam for a holiday. Jeff says, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.” 

Jeff did not want a normal bike. He wanted to build a special one. He thought a penny farthing was the craziest bike. He went to a museum to learn how to make one. After trying two times in 2001 and 2003, he finally started his trip in 2006. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. 

Jeff met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he was happy with his penny farthing. People were very surprised to see it. His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in a hostel for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. But now, Jeff says, “If I could afford it, I would travel again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”'"

This tool helps us see the ducks at night. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers are very low. We do not know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. 

We know a lot about what they do in the day, but we do not know what they do at night. The night-vision scope will help us see clearly, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and take care of the ducks better.

There are four people on my team. We work six hours every day. We study ducks in different places. Sometimes, I take a boat to see the ducks and write down what I see. The weather is not always good. Some nights are warm, but many nights are wet. It is very quiet, and I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake! 

We missed one day of work because there was too much snow. I like this work, even if it is hard. In summer, we will work in a laboratory and look at our results. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important. I would not change this job for anything!"""

She says many people like her course because it teaches many skills. You can learn to juggle, throw and catch balls, and even do trapeze, which is flying in the air above an audience. 

The course lasts one year. Students learn to take more risks in each class. Parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia says, “To be a circus performer, you need to do different things. It is important to keep your shows exciting. If you want to be good in the circus, you must practice a lot. 

Another good thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is very important too. Circus artists train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want to be successful, have ideas, and keep getting better. 

Some people think circus performers get hurt a lot or only work a little each year. But the real thing to think about is the future. You can only travel and perform when you are young, and then you need to think about other jobs.” The course also teaches business skills. Many students start their own businesses around the world and like to share their stories. Sophia says, however, that this job is not for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not give you a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”'"

You may not know her name, but you have probably heard her sing. Mariam Hobson is a backing singer. This means she sings behind the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not as good as lead singers, but that is not true. They are very talented! Mariam says, “I love my job because I never know what I will sing when I go to the studio. It can be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock music. Sometimes, I sing funny songs for radio or ads. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! I never argue; I just do my job!”

Mariam needs to be a good singer and learn quickly. Sometimes, there is no music to read. She remembers her first time recording music for a film. It was hard because there were eight singers, and each one sang a different part. There was also an orchestra. She was scared because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again. Recording takes a long time!

One of her favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Some songwriters do not know what sounds good for a female voice. When they hear Mariam sing their song, they can see how to make it better."

Now, they are sold in famous shops and many celebrities use them. Before making satchels, Julie thought about different businesses, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to choose the best idea. Some people said there was no need for satchels, but Julie believed in her idea. She worked with her mother, who is good at business, and got ideas from children’s storybooks. 

At first, Julie sold one satchel a week. To get more people interested, she sent satchels to fashion writers and asked them to write about them. They did, and more people wanted to buy them. Now, Julie is excited to see which celebrity uses her satchel! While other companies spend money on ads, Julie gets ideas from the internet to make new styles.

When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to play many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could be a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork.

When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special bike and started to race. Vicky thought this was exciting and wanted to try it too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was near her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.

Vicky became a successful track cyclist and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped racing. Vicky said, “I loved winning, but I got tired of it. When the fun stops, there is no reason to continue. Luckily, I found a new job.”

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. “We help young people who do not like sports,” she says. “First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves. CycleZone is great because it brings young people together.”

The charity uses famous people to help them. Vicky says, “Some people think having a celebrity is not always good for a charity. They say celebrities want to be famous, and this can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"

Ana Ronson is a singer and songwriter. She grew up in Ireland. Her parents did not play music, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play.

The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher said Ana should join the school theatre club to feel better. After some time in the club, Ana sang happily with 50 other students at a concert.

A year later, Ana's brother asked her to write a song for his band. She wrote her first song called ""Falling Stars"" in three days. She liked it so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. But Ana felt the teacher did not listen to her. She wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about this feeling. She shared this song online, and many people liked it.

Joss Alton, who owns a music company called Isotope Music, came to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was not sure. She did not know the company and did not want someone to tell her what to sing. But Joss said this would not happen. Soon after, Ana sang at a concert in Dublin that Isotope arranged. All the tickets sold quickly, and it was a great night.

Ana likes to write songs about real life. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision."" It is about her brother and why he stopped singing for a while. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but she wants to write about things that are important to her."

I asked Harry many times if I could go with him, and he finally said yes!

On the first morning, we saw dolphins and birds. There were islands far away, but the fog made it hard to see. I looked at the beautiful waves our boat made in the water.

We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish that I did not know. It was nice to forget about time. We always remembered to eat lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it felt good to relax.

When I started secondary school, I was very tall. My sports teacher asked me to join the basketball team. I liked the practice, but I thought I needed to get better before playing a real game.

It was also our first time doing this kind of work. But in the end, we had fun.

One of our jobs was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and bananas, so this took a long time. Josie found it hard, but I liked seeing the elephants eat. We also washed the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even if I got wet!

In the evening, we took the elephants to the forest where they slept. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom. It was hot at night, but we were ready for that. The food was very good, and we did not eat meat, which we don’t like.

After dinner, we talked and played games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked it, she says yes.

There is always a lot to do, but when people say they had a great time, it makes us happy. Our website helps us connect with other film clubs in the country. We visit them to see how they do things, but we love our own club! We started a blog because many people look for film information online. We also put up posters in cafés.

Janine Stuart is a young writer. When she was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is about a girl named Amelia. Janine said that her family moved a lot because of her father’s job. This helped her understand how it feels to be the new student in school. 

In her book, Amelia has funny moments at home, especially with her older brother. Janine does not have a brother, so she used her imagination to write about this. 

One summer, Janine was bored at home, so she started to write her novel. Her mother wanted to be a writer too, and her teachers told her to write. The year before, Janine won a prize for a short story she wrote. This is why a publishing company wanted to read Being Amelia. They liked it, and a year later, the book was in stores. 

A review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face some hard times. This makes the story real for readers. The reviewer thinks Janine is a very good writer, even if she is young. 

Now, Janine is getting used to being a famous writer. At first, she felt shy when people recognized her, but now it is OK. She wants to help other young writers, but she says they need to find their own way. For her, spending time with friends helps her find ideas to write about."
76,"Text: ""My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father got a job as the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings. At first, we were not sure about moving. We thought life on the island would be different. The castle is not as comfortable as our old home, and there is no school on the island.

After we moved, we got used to living on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is nice. In summer, many visitors come to the island, and there are parties on the beach. In winter, we see only a few other families. There are not many teenagers, which is sad for me. The adults help each other with work on the island.

The biggest change for me is taking a boat to my old school every day. I like going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then. If I miss the bus to the boat, I miss the last ferry home, and that makes me worried. When my friends come to visit, I tell them to hurry!

Sometimes, we see beautiful views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Other days, it is very foggy, and we cannot see anything. But then, the sun comes out again, and it is amazing! We do have strong storms, and I wonder if the castle is safe. But I remember it has been here for many years, and it is still standing!"""
77,"I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in nature. I watched them with my parents. They taught me how to see different types of birds and where to find them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different types of birds. I am close to this goal because I have seen birds in other countries, too. 

We look for places with birdwatching activities so I can see new birds. I have been to Egypt, and last summer I went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there, but I didn’t. I learned that you need to be patient with birdwatching. I made a video about this and many teenagers liked it. My teachers asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was nervous before I went on stage, but I remembered what to say. After I finished, my teachers said I did well. 

I am happy to live in the countryside. I know many teenagers in cities may not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should help more young people to enjoy this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter how old they are, and it does not have to cost a lot of money."
78,"Text: ""I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and I got better at it. My family thought I would stop playing like I did with other hobbies, but I didn’t. I wanted to play football professionally when I grew up. 

One day, I played in a local tournament. A referee saw me and told the manager of a women’s club to watch me. The manager asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could play in women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with the club when I was 13 years old. I got much better.

Some people were not sure I would be a star player, and this made me a little sad. But my coach told me to believe in myself. He let me play in an important match. I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal! I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! 

Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I will have a football tournament for teenagers. We want to get them interested in football and help them meet other players. They will see what it is like to play professionally and feel they can play for a good team if they work hard. I will tell them what my coach told me – there will be good times and bad times. I have been lucky and had very few bad times!"""

In the UK and other countries, schools and universities want students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research skills are important for studying and for jobs because they help you think about the world and your work.

As a student, you can help create knowledge. You do not just repeat what you learn; you ask questions. You might ask: Why? How? When? What does this mean? These questions are part of research. 

Research can be simple or very complex. Simple research can be asking questions about everyday things. You have already done some research in your life. For example, you may have asked questions for school projects or when you wanted to know how to do something, like fixing things at home or planning a holiday.

In college and university, you are expected to ask questions, think critically, and explore information. Some students may find this hard because in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. They may think it is wrong to question teachers or books. However, in many places like the UK and US, it is okay to question what you learn.

Critical thinking is very important in research. You should not just accept everything you read as true. You need to think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. It is important to not just believe everything you are told but to think for yourself."

Cities are important places for ideas and creativity. In the past, people met in coffee houses in London to talk about science and politics. Today, in Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discuss modern art in cafés. But living in a city can be hard. The same cafés that helped people talk also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside.

Cities can be very busy and stressful. Scientists are studying how living in a city affects our brains. They found that city life can make us tired and can make it hard to think clearly. One reason is that cities do not have enough nature. For example, patients in hospitals get better faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a little bit of nature can help our brains feel better.

More people now live in cities than in the countryside. This means we are often surrounded by many people and buildings. Living in a busy city can affect our mental and physical health. When we walk in a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things, like other people and cars. This can make us feel tired because our brains are always working hard.

Natural places are easier for our brains. They help us relax and feel better. This idea is called attention restoration theory. A psychologist named Stephen Kaplan first talked about it. He said that being in nature can help our brains recover. Nature has things that catch our attention without making us feel bad, unlike loud noises like police sirens.

Before scientists studied this, philosophers and city planners were already worried about city life. They wanted to bring more nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. Spending time in a park can help our brains work better quickly. 

Many people look for ways to feel better and think better, but walking in nature is one of the best ways. Even with all the problems of city life, cities keep growing. Research shows that crowded cities can also be places of new ideas and creativity. The many people in cities help create new things, just like in 18th-century London. 

The challenge is to find ways to make city life better for our minds while keeping the good things about cities. Sometimes, people feel tired of nature and want to go back to the city!"

Where is the mind? This is an interesting question. We think that thinking happens in our heads. Today, we have special machines to see what happens in the brain. But I believe that the study of the mind should not stop at our skin or skull. Many things, not just our brains, help us think.

For example, in archaeology, we see that tools, decorations, and writing help people think and grow. So, what is outside our heads can also be part of our mind. Many scientists study the mind by looking at people without their tools and objects. This is good for understanding the brain, but it can make us forget that we think with things around us.

I do not want to say that the brain is not important. I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. We should look at how our intelligence connects with culture and the things we use. I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). This idea looks at how objects help us think. For example, when we use clay to make numbers or when we use a stone to make a tool.

This idea also looks at how our thinking has changed over time. It helps us understand what minds are and how they work with things. Think about a blind person using a stick. The stick helps the person feel and understand the world. The brain can see the stick as part of the body. 

This shows us that human intelligence can change and grow with new tools. The mind is always changing. The stick, or any tool, helps us learn and understand our environment. For humans, tools help us satisfy our curiosity. This is why we make things, and these things help shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds can change as we use different objects.

I want to show that material things are important for understanding the mind. MET helps us see how tools, from simple stones to smartphones, help define who we are and how we think. Technology can change our minds, and humans have used it since the beginning.

1. What is the main question the text asks?

Photography is an important invention. It has changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It is used in many ways: for science, industry, art, and fun. Historians say photography is one of the best contributions to art in the US.

Photography started in the mid-19th century. People liked it because it used machines, and many people were excited about new technology. Just like trains and electricity made travel easier, photography brought images of the world into homes. 

The camera helps people show who they are. It allows families to keep memories, even if they are not always real. Photographs show everyday life and are a way to share what we see. A photograph is a record of what was in front of the camera. 

However, every photograph also shows the photographer's point of view. We might think we understand a photo because we know what it shows, but the meaning can be more complicated. The way we see a photo can change based on where we see it, like in a newspaper or a gallery.

For many years, artists did not talk about how important the camera was. But now, artists use photographs in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his art. Today, photography is an important part of art and helps us understand representation."

In 1890, William James was an American thinker and doctor. He helped start modern psychology. He said psychology is the ""science of mental life."" This means it studies how we think and feel. Everyone has thoughts and feelings, so we can understand this idea a little.

William James was very interested in how people think. He believed that our minds have basic parts: thoughts, feelings, and the world around us. We learn about these things from our own experiences. Sometimes, our opinions about why people act a certain way can be wrong. For example, we might think someone is sad or angry without knowing the real reason.

Psychologists try to find the best answers to questions about how we think and act. They help us understand the difference between our personal thoughts and scientific facts. Psychology studies the mind and brain, but we do not know everything about how the brain works. Psychologists learn more by watching how people behave.

Studying psychology is like solving a puzzle. Psychologists look for clues in people's behavior. They must observe carefully and measure things accurately. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and change how we think and act. This knowledge can help us in many areas, like teaching children or helping people with their feelings.

Psychology has been studied for a long time, but only scientifically for about 150 years. Early psychologists looked at their own thoughts to find answers. This method has some limits. Today, psychologists prefer to watch how people behave instead of just thinking about their own experiences."

In a building in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. Some examples are A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry is the person who runs the museum. She believes that each product has a sad story about the people who made and sold it.

The museum is surprising because it makes money. Many companies do not keep their failed products. They do not want to think about their mistakes. The museum started by a man named Robert McMath. He wanted to collect new products, not just the ones that failed. He began this in the 1960s. He learned that most products do not succeed. 

The museum shows how people often think positively. They believe their products will do well, even when they do not. Sometimes, people spend more money on a bad product to try to make it sell. They do not want to talk about why it failed. 

There is a popular idea called ""positive visualization."" This means if you think good things will happen, they might happen. Some scientists say that people often think things will go better than they really will. 

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen studied this idea. She found that thinking too much about good outcomes can make people less motivated to work hard. For example, people who imagined having a great week at work did not do as well as they hoped.

Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, studied how people feel about failure. She says some people think ability is something you are born with. They feel bad when they fail. Other people believe ability can grow with effort and practice. They see failure as a way to learn and improve. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles get stronger when they are pushed to their limits. 

In summary, having a positive view can be good, but it is also important to learn from failure.

Everyone knows that sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but things in professional sports are changing quickly. Two main reasons make us question the idea of home advantage: science and money. 

Sports scientists want to understand how players can play their best. They have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who pay for sports want to know why home advantage is important. They think that if players are paid enough, they should feel good playing anywhere.

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some games far away, in places like the Far East, to reach more fans? It would matter to fans in Britain. They believe their team needs their support and energy. Fans often think that when they cheer, their team scores a goal. But they forget the times when their cheering did not help.

One thing that seems true is that home fans also cheer for the referee. In a study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another game without noise. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees try to avoid making calls that upset the home fans.

Studies show that home advantage has become less important in many sports, but not by much. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England won about 70% of the time. Now, they win about 60% of the time. One reason for this change is travel. Today, players travel in comfort, and they stay in nice hotels.

Different sports have different levels of home advantage. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball is about teamwork. In basketball, players feel more confident when they play at home.

Another interesting point is that players have higher testosterone levels before home games. This might be because they want to protect their home ground. In some recent games, teams that were not expected to win did well at home. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there.""

**Questions:**

1. Why do sports teams often do better at home?

3. How do fans feel about their team playing far away?

""The more I practice, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player a long time ago. This saying is famous in sports. Many athletes and their coaches believe it. 

People argue about who first said this. Some think other golfers said it too. The meaning of the saying is not clear. Player did not mean ""lucky"" in a real way. He meant, ""The more I practice, the better I get."" 

This saying connects to a big question: Is talent something you are born with, or can you learn it? Many people believe that practice is more important than talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said that to be an expert in something, you need to practice for 10,000 hours. His idea is in many books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers. These books say that practice is the most important thing to become good at something.

But author Epstein thinks differently. He says that looking only at the best people does not help us understand why some people are good and others are not. He travels around the world to find answers. He learns that in a tough dog race in Alaska, the dogs' desire to win is very important. This shows that some abilities might come from genes, not just practice.

Epstein talks about ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture). He believes both are important for top athletes. He thinks that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have played basketball instead of being the fastest man in the world. 

Epstein also asks important questions about race and gender in sports. He wonders why we have separate competitions for men and women if practice is the only thing that matters. Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest ones."

A new report says many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her book, Kith, she explains that many children stay inside and spend too much time in front of screens, like TVs and computers. They do not go outside to enjoy nature, like the woods, mountains, and rivers. This is a big part of the problem.

A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. Many children said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their childhoods fondly. They talk about playing outside, swimming, and exploring. They think this was better than how children live today. However, they forget that they are the ones who keep their children safe and do not let them play outside as much.

Griffiths writes about how parents worry about dangers outside. This worry makes them keep their children at home. Because of this, toy companies sell more toys to keep children busy inside. She also talks about how some children are given medicine for being restless or have to wear goggles to play games. 

Griffiths is very passionate about children’s freedom to play and explore. But sometimes, she goes too far with her ideas. She believes children should be free to explore and take risks. She says children need to have small accidents to learn how to be safe. However, she does not explain how to let children have these small accidents safely. 

Not all children want to explore the wild. Some children are shy or prefer to stay at home. Maybe the real problem is that we try to make all children act the same way, whether we keep them inside or push them outside.

I am a psychologist who studies how people think and feel. I have a PhD, which means I studied a lot in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life. But many problems in life are not solved by what we learn in school. They need experience and creativity. 

For children, play is very important for learning. All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that need to learn more play more. For example, meat-eating animals play more than plant-eating animals because hunting is harder to learn. Monkeys play more than other animals because they need to learn many things. 

Children play a lot because they have much to learn. Play helps children learn important skills. These skills include thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their feelings. Creativity is very important for success in life. 

We do not need people who just follow orders or do simple math. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can help people think creatively, we will have a strong workforce. 

Some adults, called geniuses, keep their playful minds. Albert Einstein said school almost made him lose his love for math and science, but he found it again after school. He called his creative work ""combinatorial play."" 

We cannot teach creativity, but school can sometimes take it away. School often focuses on answers that are already known instead of letting children ask their own questions. 

It is also very important for children to get along with others and care about them. Children want to play with other children, and through play, they learn how to be fair and kind. Play is something children choose to do. If they cannot stop playing, it is not really play. 

Today, school is harder. There is less time for breaks, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Organized sports have taken the place of free play. Adults now plan playdates instead of letting children play freely. 

These changes have happened slowly, but they are very big. They are caused by many things, like parents being worried, experts warning about dangers, and the idea that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and the future, we must let them play and explore. This will help them grow into strong adults ready for the future.

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them talk to possible employers. Before, people had to stand outside offices with signs that said ""hire me"" to get attention. But now, it is easier to make mistakes online.

For example, a young man in the US sent a message to a marketing executive on LinkedIn. He wanted her to help him find a job because she knew many important people. However, she was upset and did not want to share her contacts. She rejected his request and wrote a mean message that many people saw online. People were shocked by her message, and she might regret how she wrote it. 

This situation shows that young people need to be careful when using social media for jobs. Many young people use sites like Facebook and Twitter for fun, but using them for work is different. When I was a teenager, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could talk to someone online and then ignore them at school. You could also make yourself look different with pictures and songs on Facebook.

But now, using social media for work is not the same. Some young people still act like they did when they were teenagers. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will get a job on LinkedIn. We need to understand that the way we used social media as kids is not good for finding jobs now. 

Employers often say that young job seekers are too casual and seem arrogant. This makes older people think badly of us. In reality, many young people are worried about finding jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of being arrogant can hurt young people who have the skills to work.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, say who you are and explain how you can help them. This way, they are more likely to reply. Do not send the same message to many people, and be polite. Remember, social media can help you make good contacts, but you need to use it carefully."

Some people say they can predict the future of newspapers. But they are wrong. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, many newspapers in the UK have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, only 26 out of 100 people get their news from newspapers now. This is less than in 2001 when 45 out of 100 people did.

Many people think that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. But history shows that old types of media often survive. For example, in 1835, a journalist said that books and theaters would not be popular anymore, but they are still here. Radio is still popular even with TV. Movies are still watched, even with videos and DVDs. Even old music records are coming back.

Newspapers were once new too. It took a long time for them to become the main way to get news. This happened because it became easier to share news with many people. In the past, people did not think about needing news all the time. They only saw changes in the seasons or big disasters like floods or diseases.

Before the 19th century, being a journalist was not a real job for many people. There was no need for news every day or week. Now, we expect news often. Online news lets us read what we want when we want. We can get updates quickly, and we can read more about stories.

But many news providers focus on being the first to share news instead of helping us understand it. In the past, news was shared in busy places like markets or pubs, where truth and rumors mixed together. Now, it seems we are going back to that way. Newspapers have not always done a good job of explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand better.

Humans live mostly in the light of the sun. We are used to being awake during the day. Our eyes are made for sunlight. But we have changed the night by adding a lot of artificial light. This is called light pollution. 

Light pollution happens when lights shine up into the sky instead of down where we need them. This bright light can change how animals live. Many animals, like birds, need darkness to sleep, find food, and have babies. 

A long time ago, in 1800, people in London used candles and lanterns. There were not many lights in the streets. The night was dark, and people could see the stars. Now, we have many bright lights, and we cannot see the stars as well. 

Light is very strong and can attract animals. Birds can fly towards bright lights and get lost. Some birds sing at night because of the lights. 

We need darkness to be healthy. If we do not have darkness, our bodies do not work well. Our sleep and wake times are important for our health. 

In the end, light pollution makes us forget about the night sky and our place in the universe. We lose the beauty of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night."

A leader of a big company said that his workers can take as many holidays as they want. He got this idea from a smaller internet company that does the same thing. He also got an email from his daughter about this idea. 

The big company has 50,000 workers and does many different jobs, like finance and healthcare. The smaller company has 2,000 workers and does one job. The idea of taking unlimited holidays might work better in a small company where workers know each other well. In a big company, it can be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business.

The leader said workers can take leave if they feel sure that their work is done and their team is okay. But it is hard to be sure. When you come back from a holiday, there is always a lot of work waiting for you. This can make workers feel guilty about taking time off. Feeling guilty can make workers stressed, and if they do not take enough holidays, they may not work well in the long run.

In big companies, there is often pressure to work late. This can make workers feel they should not take holidays. If workers do not feel safe to take their holidays, they may not take them at all. They might still follow the old rules about holidays, which would make the new policy not useful.

Today, technology makes it easy to get work messages anytime. The smaller internet company started this new holiday policy because workers wanted to know how to balance work and time off. But if there are no set working hours, workers may feel they always have to work. 

Workers have rights to take holidays because rest is important for their health. Good feelings and creativity can happen even if workers are not always on holiday. I am not sure if this new holiday policy will really help workers take time off.

Peer review is when experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This process is important because it helps to make sure that the research is good and correct. Sometimes, this review can take a long time, even up to a year. Some people think this is good because it helps keep the research trustworthy. Others think it is too slow.

There are new ways to share research, like preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they are reviewed. This helps researchers share their findings quickly so others can read and discuss them. Many scientists still want to publish in journals, but some believe that preprints can help improve the system.

Some scientists worry that if papers are published without review, there could be bad research, called ""junk science."" However, preprints allow for open discussion, and many people can give feedback on the work. For example, Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her paper as a preprint. This way, the original authors could respond to her work, and everyone could see the discussion.

Preprint archives help scientists talk about their work with others around the world. They also allow researchers to share negative results, which are often ignored by journals. Sharing papers as preprints can lead to more people reading and citing them. This shows that preprints can be a good way to share research and focus on the work itself, not just where it is published.

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say, ""a painting in words."" But this answer does not make me happy. One day, I asked my students to pick an object and write about it. They had to write one paragraph like a scientist and another paragraph from the object’s point of view, calling it ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used in emergencies and only for a short time. Most people will not use me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class understand how poetry works. The exercise was fun and led to good talks.

When I was in school, poetry was hard for me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle. After school, many people read less poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it is not like regular writing. It makes you want to read it, but often you feel let down because it is hard to understand. 

What do we want from poems? A poem can show deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts. But if we want tears, we watch movies. If we want information, we read articles. Novels take us to new worlds, and music is special too. 

A poem can be unclear. Life is often unclear, too. But this does not tell us what a poem really is. If you look up ""poem"" online, it says it is a type of art that uses the beauty of language. This is nice, but it does not explain the word well. ""Poem"" comes from Greek and means ""a thing made."" A poet is a ""maker of things."" 

So, what kind of thing is a poem? Some people say poems are like wild animals – hard to control – or like machines – made with care. But these ideas can change when we think more about them. Talking about what a poem is can help us think differently about many things. 

We often remember song lyrics. Words and music can stick in our heads. A poem can hit us hard, even if it is just words on a page. A poem has special space around it in a magazine or book. This space could be for a longer article or an ad. A poem is written and rewritten like a story, but it is not just for selling. 

A poem is not just a product; it is special by itself. Because of this, a poem can surprise us, even if just for a moment.

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money then. My wife, Marion, was very happy when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, I found many things like brooches and coins. I liked feeling connected to the past. 

After the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something that impressed Marion again. One rainy February afternoon, I had some time to search. I went to a place where I knew there were old farming tools. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug down into the mud and found a round, golden ball. I was excited but tried not to get my hopes up. 

As I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful loop. I remembered seeing something like it in the British Museum. It was called a torc, a special necklace from over 2,000 years ago. I took it to my car and looked at it on the way home. I showed it to Marion when I got back. She was surprised and asked what it was. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. 

We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to break it. At night, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I put it under a floorboard in my office. The law says I must tell the authorities about my find within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before I gave it up. I even took it to show a friend in the hospital. 

Finally, I took it to the council office. The registrar was busy talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He stopped talking and looked at it. The torc was confirmed as real and was sold to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. I got £350,000 from the sale, which I shared with the owner of the field. 

But the torc is more than just money. It is something special for everyone. People ask me if I will stop using my metal detector now. But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I will keep searching for more treasures."
96,"Text: ""Sleeping is one of my favorite things when I travel. I don’t talk about it much because I feel a little bad. My friends like to tell me about their busy trips with many activities, like visiting museums and hiking. I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew I like to take naps in the afternoon and sleep in nice beds in Italy? Sleeping better is a nice part of traveling. 

When I went to Mexico when I was young, I was surprised that I slept more than 12 hours some days. There were loud birds outside, but I didn’t care. I felt safe and could sleep deeply. Without alarms and worries, I could sleep easily. I think sleeping is part of traveling, not just a break. When we travel, we see and hear new things. When we sleep, we think about these new experiences. 

Sleep is different in every place. People worry about jet lag, but I think it is more about getting used to new places. In Trinidad, for example, people wake up early, feel sleepy in the middle of the day, and then are active in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their sleep times. When I finally do, I feel like I belong there.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in a nice apartment by the sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy and stopped talking. One by one, my friends went to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows. I took some pillows too and followed them. I knew about the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.

Travel sleep is special because I remember it. In a new place, I enjoy the different smells and sounds while I sleep. If traveling slowly means enjoying every moment, then sleeping is a part of that. Maybe I should not feel bad about my love for sleep and tell my friends that sleeping is also an important part of traveling."""

The woman looked at herself in the mirror. “What do you think? Be honest,” she said. Mia picked up a nice hat. It was medium-sized and had a pretty bow. “I think this one looks best on you,” she said. The woman made a funny face. “But it is boring,” she said. “Many women will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This hat will make me special.” She smiled at the small red and black hat on her head. “Yes, I want this one,” she said.

Mia smiled back. She knew the woman would stand out at the wedding. Mia thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today. They were having a family party. Mia was happy to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also excited to meet Jen’s friend, Tattie. Mia’s husband, Jeff, was not sure about the name. “What kind of name is that?” he asked. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia said. “I think it’s nice.” Jeff thought it was a strange name. He did not like things that were too fancy. He also thought Mia was too polite. 

An hour later, Mia finished work and went home. It took her only forty seconds to get there. Four years ago, when Luke left home, Mia wanted to turn a barn into a shop for her hats. Jeff was not sure. “Do people really want hats?” he asked. Mia knew they did. She listened to her friends who had trouble finding the right hat for special occasions. 

Mia was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to try on hats in her shop in Little Pelham. She made it easy for them to find the right hat. She even let them bring their clothes to match with the hats. Now, she also sold handbags and jewelry."

Lawrence Okoye is from London. He has moved to Atlanta, USA. He is thinking about his journey in sports. He is very confident but surprised by how far he has come. He was in the Olympic final for discus throwing. Now, he might play American football, even though he has never played it before.

Lawrence is learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London could be chosen for a big American football team. But Lawrence believes in himself. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to train for discus instead. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.

Lawrence came to Atlanta to train for discus. He wanted to prepare for the world championships. He thought about American football but only decided to try it when he got to the USA. After arriving, he saw that there were trials for the NFL in Atlanta. He applied to join the trials, even though he had never played before. 

When asked if he was nervous, he said no. He is sure of his abilities. He did well in tests and drills, and this made him stand out as a good player. He felt happy to hear that he was impressive. 

Lawrence knows he has no experience in football, but he believes he has what it takes. He thinks it is about how hard he works. He is not worried about being selected for a team. Some people say he will be chosen, but he is not too concerned. 

He had a tough time in the Olympic final when he came last, but he is okay now. He is proud that he made it to the final. He knows that sports can be difficult. 

In the NFL, players can earn a lot of money. Lawrence has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Some people think he should focus on just one sport. Lawrence understands this but wants to follow his dreams. If football does not work out, he can go back to discus, which he loves. He thinks carefully about his choices."

I woke up on a plane. It was morning, and I looked out the window. I saw a lot of brown and green land. It was September, but it was still not cold in Siberia. I could not see any people. There were mountains, rivers, and forests. My neighbor woke up and smiled. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a Russian accent. His name was Sergei. He was a salesman from Moscow. He was going to sell safety clothes to miners. 

I told him I was going to Magadan, a city in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to ride my bicycle back to England. “But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan. You cannot ride a bicycle.” I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked. “No, I will ride with my friend Al,” I said. “Just one friend?” he asked. “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei looked worried and said “Holodna” (cold) while pointing outside. I showed him my warm clothes with my hands. I did not tell him I did not have much money. I bought my clothes at low prices. I was not sure if they were good enough. 

It all started in a classroom in Scotland. The teacher was talking, and the students were tired. I had a question. I wrote a note to my friend Al. “Hi Al, do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway this summer? Rob.” I passed the note to Al. He read it and wrote back, “OK.” 

Now, six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I was a geography teacher. My job was sometimes hard, but it was also fun. I had long holidays to go on adventures. I visited Al twice during these holidays. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted to cycle around the world. He was taking on big challenges. Sometimes he thought it was too hard, but I admired him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving people wrong who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him, and it made him feel alive."

In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons. The pylons are between 15 and 25 metres high. The pilots fly very fast, up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to try this flying. 

One hour before my flight, I signed two papers. The first paper said I was healthy. The second paper said I had to empty my pockets. Small things can be dangerous when flying. I learned that I must look at the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax when flying upside down and enjoy the view.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started to fly, I was nervous. I had to keep calm and focused. If I panicked, it would be bad. 

The pilot, Dario, and I were in a very fast plane called the Zivko Edge 540. The plane took off, and we turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon and tensed my body. For a moment, I felt very heavy. Then we flew straight again. 

We turned left and went down fast. I felt my stomach drop. We flew close to the ground, between two pylons, very fast. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand was shaking. Dario then did a barrel roll, which is a full turn in the air. I asked him to repeat what he said, but he did another trick called a loop. 

Many people like this kind of flying, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was easier than what the pilots usually do. When we landed, Dario ate sandwiches, but I could not eat for a long time. That night, I dreamed about flying in loops.

Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature show, he may have filmed them. He likes it very cold, about -18C. Allan studied marine biology and was a diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places.

His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working. He helped the crew find good places to film. After two days, he realized he loved being a wildlife cameraman. He could travel, have adventures, and dive underwater.

Now, he is a famous cameraman and has worked on many wildlife TV shows. When he started 35 years ago, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. Allan became known as the ""cold man."" He found many amazing things to film.

When he started, the camera technology was very simple. It is easier to film today. In the past, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital cameras, you can see what you filmed right away. Before, you had to think about what to film next. Film was expensive, but now you can take many videos.

Allan has a lot of experience in cold places. He knows how to work in the cold. He has spent a lot of time on sea ice. He does get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes.

Allan says wildlife filming has many successes, but also mistakes. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not tell which birds they were. Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. This place is home to polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, it is usually -32C, and the wind is strong. Carrying cameras in deep snow is hard. 

After walking for five hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, Allan saw only one mother bear and her cub. On the 24th day, he felt like he was in the bear world. He waited and watched. After five hours, he saw a quick glimpse of a bear. The camera was ready, and he looked through the viewfinder. He saw a black nose, then a big head, and soon the bear was resting in front of the hole. She looked at him but did not care. Then she slid down the slope, and two cubs appeared. It was their first time seeing the world.

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects them. He believes he can make a great documentary."

In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone. He did not get help on the way. He had to swim in very cold water and fight against frostbite and polar bears. Eight months later, he also went to the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic. He is getting ready for a new trip that is very important. 

Pen and two friends will walk for three months, covering 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice. No one has done this before, and the information will help scientists understand global warming. 

When he was a child, Pen had a nanny who worked for a famous polar explorer. She made him strong by sending him outside in bad weather with few clothes. His father also loved adventures in the cold. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps him with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he thinks about the Arctic.

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He finds it hard to be away from them. Last time he left, he told his son to take care of his mother and sister. His son took this very seriously and worried a lot. Pen thinks it was not fair to say that. This time, he will not contact them much while he is in the Arctic because he does not want to remind them how far away he is.

Before he leaves, he is getting ready and checking his equipment. He says it is hard to fix things on the ice. He will be with Ann Daniels, a famous polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them.

Pen is also thinking about his age. He will be 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He is worried about what he will do on the trip. He believes this mission is important because it will help scientists and many people understand what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He feels that their skills are now very useful."

I wanted to stay fit to try for the Olympics if I felt like it. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. But then, I remembered Ben Fogle’s invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I love rowing and the feeling of the boat in the water. I missed it, but I was not ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not excited. I knew if I joined, I would want to win. But rowing with Ben might not be the best chance to win. However, being an underdog without pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. This made the race real. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money after being a sportsman. It feels nice that people want to hear me speak. But I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I was doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. One big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. Training for the Olympics was hard, but it was simple. I trained a lot, but I had a plan, doctors, and dieticians. I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV. But my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing; it is also about the mind. Ben had done tough challenges, but he could not row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my honesty. I could have been more patient, but I needed to tell him how much he needed to improve. I should have known this would be his level when I agreed to race with him."""

A little over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 years old and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, snowy places because I was tired of busy London. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi in Finnish Lapland. They hired me as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, many tourists come to ride sleds pulled by huskies on the snow. The company started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is simple and does not have running water.

I could work with them for three months. They told me the work is hard and the hours are long. I started to pack my things. 

**November 6, London**  
On my flight, I looked at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I needed to remember their names, but I felt nervous. I looked out of the window instead. I thought about how winter was coming and rivers were freezing.

**November 7, Helsinki and Hetta**  
The bus ride north was what I wanted. We drove through dark forests with snow on the trees. We stopped for reindeer on the road. I arrived at the farm at night. Anna gave me boots and sent me outside into the cold. She asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the sound of barking and found the dogs. They were very excited. I tried to introduce myself, but everyone was busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs. Then someone told me to get in the sled, and we started moving into the dark with a headlamp.

**November 15, Hetta**  
I learned how to be a husky guide quickly, but first, Anna asked me if I was useful. I didn’t know what to say. I had never driven a snowmobile or used an axe. But I had a driving license, and that made me feel better. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding fast: lean into the corners, use both feet to stop, and hold the handlebar tight. But other tasks were hard. For example, water for the dogs would freeze quickly, so we made a 'soup' of meat in hot water for them. By the end of my first week, I was tired and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds. But I felt proud. I told my friends, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw. In the snow!"""

One day, Paula Radcliffe ran very fast in a marathon. When she finished, many reporters came to talk to her. They said her time was so good that she could run in the men's marathon in Paris. The reporters asked her about emu oil, a special oil that helps heal injuries. Cathy Freeman, an Olympic champion, told her to use it after Radcliffe had an accident while training.

Radcliffe said she did not think much about her big win at first. She felt it was just what she was supposed to do that day. She and her team believed in no limits. During the race, her husband Gary and her physiotherapist Gerard were in a car, listening to the race on the radio. After 16 kilometers, her agent worried that she might not keep up her fast pace. Gerard was angry about this because he knew how fit she was.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe thought she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers very fast, but she still ran the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he never thought anyone would run that fast again. Radcliffe thought she would come back and do it next year, but that did not happen.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how she won against very skilled runners from East Africa. Gerard worked with Radcliffe a lot, helping her with her training. He said she could take a lot of pain and worked very hard. He traveled 13 hours to see her, and when he arrived, her husband said, ""Gerard, you're late, Paula is waiting."" There was no time for tea; she wanted to start training right away.

Gerard spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes were unhappy. When asked why no one has run as fast as her, Radcliffe said she trained hard, but some people are more talented. She thought Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner, could do it. Radcliffe believed that some runners focus more on racing each other than on their own best times.

She explained that she always pushed herself to run hard, even when she was winning. Radcliffe did not know it then, but that marathon was the best time of her career. She never ran that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."

When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, started, I was nervous. I did not know if people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a new way of cooking in Britain. I thought we made a good show that was different. I was happy and scared when I watched the first episode. I did not need to worry. The show was successful, and I made other projects, including a book about my restaurant. 

In each project, I felt like I was on a journey. I wrote several books called ‘Perfection’, and each book went with a TV show. In these shows, I traveled to meet special people. One man made golden pasta that tasted amazing. These people worked hard for many years to reach their idea of perfection. 

Perfection means different things to different people. Choosing which dishes to show was hard. I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. I could hear them asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie? Where is bread and butter pudding?” But after a long meeting, my team and I made a list that had something for everyone. 

I believe everyone has their own idea of perfection based on their feelings and memories. Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew the recipes were not the only way to cook. I used my skills and talked to many people to find out what makes these dishes good. 

The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means trying new ideas and improving them. The TV show let me explore many foods and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in the same way. 

I traveled to find the best ingredients. I had many adventures, like visiting a factory that used the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming. I even milked a cow by hand and made ice cream with dry ice. I cooked chicken in a hospital machine and almost burned my house trying to make a real Neapolitan pizza."

We were far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field. It stopped moving. John got out and looked at the engine. He stood there for a long time with his hands in his pockets. He looked confused. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big. There was only grass and some flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I said too, because I wanted to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Tell us a story.” So I told them about two birds I heard talking before we left London. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. I felt sad. “I do.” But I didn’t sound sure. “Liar,” Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I wanted to ask Mum, but she was asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys. They helped us push the van to a hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys waved and smiled at her. We followed John into a café. It was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was sweet and made from mint leaves. Mum looked at the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said when it got dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road. She made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on the ground. “I will have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. 

Later, we sat in a truck watching our van being pulled behind. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we would get home now that our van had to be pulled. I thought it might be easier to take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep."

Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel. She was talking to two other pianists. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe. Lucy did not know the girl’s name well because it was loud. They were both older than Lucy. They spoke English well. They talked about the music they played and where they had traveled.

“I think I’m going to Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. Tanglewood is a famous music festival. Lucy did not really want to go there. She was busy with concerts and competitions. She missed a lot of school and was not in school anymore. She learned music with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy did not want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen pianists her age could come from all over the world. Lucy was one of them. Her dad bought her a nice necklace to celebrate. Her little brother, Gus, wanted to be in the festival one day. Lucy’s teacher, Grace, took her out for dinner to talk about music.

Lucy did not apply to the festival. Her mom filled out the form and sent a CD. “I didn’t want you to be sad if you didn’t get in,” her mom said. Lucy thought her mom did not want her to say no. 

The guy from Tokyo asked, “How old are you?” 

“Fifteen,” Lucy replied. The girl said, “Wow.” Lucy did not mean to show off. It was hard to know when to share and when to brag. 

“Have you ever been to Japan?” the guy asked. 

“Once, when I was eight,” Lucy said. 

Then, Lucy’s grandfather came to her. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said. He took her away from the conversation. “Don’t be too friendly with the competition,” he added. 

“They are not the competition,” Lucy said. 

“Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather replied. He took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded but did not understand everything.

In the elevator, her grandfather said, “You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This festival is important, and people know you.” Lucy liked that. She liked being someone special. But at school, her friends did not care about her music. Even her best friend, Reyna, did not know how good she was. But here, at the festival, Lucy felt important."

“Dad said, ‘You spend too much time online. You need to go outside.’ I wanted to know more, so I read what experts say. They say it is interesting. Many teenagers who use social media have real friends, feel good about themselves, and learn important skills for the digital world.

Simon Miles, an expert, says social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use it all the time, like a youth club. It helps them share jokes and talk about their lives. Jim Matthews, another expert, says social media helps teenagers find their identity and deal with problems with friends.

Professor Keith Davidson says that when you are a teenager, you ask, “Who am I?” Social media can help you learn about yourself. You can share your favorite music or sports and see how others think. He says that people who use social media are not selfish. It can be easier to talk online than in person, especially for shy people.

Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social media. He thinks it helps quiet people with special interests connect with others. If you like a certain type of music and only a few people in your school do too, you can find friends online who like it too.

Pauline White, an expert in digital education, says young people can find new interests online and create their own content. She believes social media helps teenagers be creative. They can make videos, podcasts, and blogs. Photo-sharing sites help photographers learn and share their work. This can help them get jobs in the future.

Every business uses social media to sell things. If you have many friends online, they can be customers for your product. Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they grow up and work, says Matthews. He believes working together online is an important skill for the future.”"

When people think of a family vacation, they may not think of a long trip across many states in the US and Canada. But my parents wanted to have a fun family trip this summer. My dad wanted to plan a trip for us to spend time together. My brother and I were not very excited about it.

In mid-June, we packed our car with bags and food. I was happy but also worried about being with my family for two weeks. We started our big road trip. We left our big house and drove a long way. I wondered what would happen on this trip.

We drove west through Oklahoma. We had some adventures. One night, we stopped in Oklahoma and saw many stars in the sky. We learned that cows can cross the road first! The next day, we woke up early and drove again. We saw deserts and then mountains. Each day was different, but they all felt similar.

We visited the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. It smelled funny there. We learned that some roads are not good for regular cars. We saw many old and new things on our trip. Sometimes, we had to wait in traffic because of construction. We laughed when we saw big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument.

We saw many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park. There, we watched the sunset and saw bears. Sometimes, we had to stop for bears on the road. We had some exciting moments with bears and park rangers. 

As we drove, I forgot about home. The hotel we stayed in was old and did not have internet, but the views were beautiful. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we drove back home. My parents were right. You can find amazing things close to home. 

When we got home, I was happy to be with my family again. We took many photos of our trip. I knew I would remember the fun surprises we had on our journey."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school. She had a nice room at her college with a kitchen and a study area. Amy could use the Internet and phone for free. Jeff and Dahlia would check on Amy, even if she did not like it.

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She did not remember much about her grandmother, and she never knew her grandfather. Daisy wanted Rose to stay with her. Rose's parents were not happy about this, but Daisy was excited to see Rose again. Rose did not know why her parents did not like her grandma, but they had a fight a long time ago. Rose had not seen Daisy since she was ten years old, but she remembered happy times.

Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy liked to meet people and have fun. Rose thought she would get dinner invitations and go shopping with her grandma. This made her smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady. She went to many social events.

Before moving, Dahlia talked to Rose. Rose was sensible and knew about healthy eating and exercise. But she wanted to be independent. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She did not want to be told what to do all the time. Daisy understood this. 

Dahlia gave Rose a new mobile phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They all agreed to trust each other. Rose would act mature, and Daisy would not be too strict. If they had problems, they would talk about it.

Rose was not a wild child. She had good friends, and her school reports were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school. This was her fourth school in five years, so she was used to it. She knew this would be her last school before finishing. For Rose, it was a new beginning in her life."

Charlotte Grainger had a teacher in primary school who thought she might write a book. Charlotte wanted to write a book because it seemed like a big challenge. When she turned 13, she decided to try. Now, her book is going to be published. She told her old teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40 years old. Charlotte did not understand why she should wait.

It is a winter afternoon in the office of Charlotte’s publishers. I was going to talk to a 15-year-old girl about her book. The book is very good. It has a strong story and a lot of action. You would not guess it was written by a teenager. A person from the publishing company is with us, but Charlotte does not need help. She is confident and smart, but she is also calm.

Charlotte knows she is young. I asked her about the big questions in her book. She said, “I was asking big questions, not answering them. I don’t have many life lessons to share.” She is interested in the idea of taking responsibility.

Charlotte thinks that books for teenagers often show three types of characters: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who has social problems. She does not like these types. She thinks there should be stories about teenagers who are okay and confident. She believes some writers make teenagers feel they do not know who they are, which can hurt their self-belief.

Charlotte loves to read books by famous fantasy writers, but sometimes these books made her not want to write. She thought, “Do I have to write like this to make a good book?” However, she liked a book called *How Not to Write a Novel*. It says that if the reader can guess what will happen, the story is not exciting anymore.

Charlotte’s parents are both journalists, and this helped her get her book published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book. She knows she is lucky because it is hard to get someone to read a first book. She says, “Every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I do not take anything for granted.” 

**Questions:**

1. Who thought Charlotte might write a book?
2. How old was Charlotte when she decided to write her book?
3. What does Charlotte think about the types of characters in books for teenagers?
4. What book helped Charlotte with her writing?
5. Why does Charlotte think she is lucky?"

""‘Remember, speed is good, not bad,’ said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked at the ski slope. ‘Who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then a guy named David, who had some experience with ski-jumping, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew up into the air. We all held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed can be tricky.’ 

I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On other ski trips, I liked to practice turns in the snow. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps. I thought it looked fun, but I was scared to try. Then my parents took us to a training center for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and tried new tricks, landing in foam cubes. This was not like skiing outside. 

After practicing inside, we went outside to try skiing for real. ‘You will get better!’ the center’s sign said. ‘Before places like this, new ski jumpers just went down the slopes and hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land on the flat part, you will get hurt.’ The flat part is called the ‘knuckle.’ If you land in the right place, you keep going. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, and it hurts. So, speed is important.

At first, I was scared to go fast. My legs wanted to stop as I got close to the jump, so I landed on the knuckle. I did not fall, but I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump,’ said Gareth. 

On the second day, we practiced on the trampolines. I thought I would not like being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises helped us learn how to jump. Gareth told us what to do. I needed to learn more about my body in the air. Every time I jumped, I only knew I was going up and then I found myself in the foam cubes.

We went back to the mountain to try again. I had some problems, but I finally landed well. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But on my last jump of the day, I went fast and landed in the right place. Then I saw my skis sliding down the slope, no longer on my feet."""

Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in a fun park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath. Then, the carriage goes up slowly. There is a pause. Suddenly, it drops down, and your stomach feels funny. You go fast forward, then turn left, and then upside down. You feel scared and scream. But you chose to go to the fun park, like many other people do every year.

Fun parks are very popular. They have many exciting rides. Many people work hard to make these rides safe and fun. They are engineers, designers, and marketing experts. Some people dream of being rollercoaster designers when they are kids. But it is a big job. Designers must make the ride fun and safe. They also need to make new rides to keep people interested.

Many rollercoaster ideas were made a long time ago by a designer named John Miller. He made rides that were very exciting. Now, designers must follow rules and use special designs for rides. I talked to some experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a thrill engineer, said the skill is in putting everything together. Dr. John Roberts said it is important to make people feel excited but safe at the same time.

To make a great ride, designers create a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase. They also think about how tall the ride is, how many twists it has, and how steep the drops are. Professor Walker said that experience and testing are very important. Jeff Hornick, a theme park director, said it helps to love thrills to understand what people want.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoasters. Walker said that while new technology is exciting, the real ride experience is still the most important part."

Miranda Ellington is 25 years old. She is a choreographer. She makes dance shows for many theatres and dance groups. Sometimes, she still dances. I ask her why she does both things. She says, ""Dancing helps me remember what it is like to be a dancer. It can be hard to take orders from choreographers."" 

As a choreographer, Miranda teaches young dancers. She likes working with them. ""Young dancers are open to new ideas. They want to learn and succeed. They may not know their strengths and weaknesses yet. They listen to my advice, even if it is tough. Sometimes, they ask questions, and I like their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps. The music helps her decide what to do. ""Sometimes, I don’t like a piece of music, but I still make a good dance for it. If dancers do not like the music, it can be hard, but I must find a way to help them. I wish I could try different music to make rehearsals better, but I usually work on big shows where the music is already chosen.""

Miranda does not want to stay with one place. ""I like to meet new people. But each theatre and school has different ways of working. I must change how I work each time I go somewhere new. This helps me not to get stuck in one way.""

We talk about a new documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, ""Some documentaries look nice but are not real. This one shows the true life in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections. I smiled because I understand her struggle. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not see how much work ballet takes.""

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance show. She says, ""It is when everything works well together – the music, costumes, lights, and dancers. We may not be perfect, but aiming high is good for the audience. Sometimes, the dance is good, but the costumes can be distracting, and that is disappointing.""

Miranda has done many types of work. I ask if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet choreographer. She replies, ""People want to label you, but I don’t understand why. I don’t want to be known for just one thing. For now, I want to learn and try new things."""
116,"Text: ""A friend asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that TV shows many amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to see outside? This made me think of my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was giving away his old sofa, and I used it in my film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and used old seatbelts to carry it. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it at night, even one night on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and cheered me on. I have walked a lot in the past years, but this was very different. It was the longest I have ever walked, and I could stop at cafes and relax on the sofa with a drink instead of sitting on a rock. I often told people, “No, I am not doing this for charity, and I am not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I like to tell them how I pulled a sofa 100 miles in southern England instead of talking about TV shows. You can see the film on my website."""
117,"Text: ""I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands. I was excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person. Many families go to the islands. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would join ten other people to swim around the small islands. He smiled and showed me on the boat.

Before we started, our group sent emails to each other, but we did not have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us a support boat would help us, and they showed us how to talk to it. We swam a short distance to split us into speed groups. Then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the sea.

Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this swim, and I was very happy when I did it by myself. The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to look at the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I swam faster and enjoyed it more. I did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come back next year."""
118,"Text: ""Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it is fun. I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with great people, I have free time, and my job is never boring. When I was a child, I went to a school far from my family. I flew alone to go to school and come back home. Sometimes, I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help them serve food to the passengers. Later, when I wanted a new job, I remembered this. 

At the job interview, there were many young people like me. They were also changing jobs. I practiced what to say before the interview. I talked about my skills and my past jobs, not just that I liked to travel. Because of this, I got the job! 

I think this job is good for many people. There are many good things about it, but free flights are not the best part. Most airline workers work very hard. There is a saying: 'No one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family. Even if we do not see each other all the time, we are still close. When I am not working, I do not take work home. If I have a difficult passenger, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will not see them again."""
119,"Text: ""At the summer camp where I work, I like to see the children do well. Most children can swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but with help, they try and reach the top. This makes them happy. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home. It is usually the children who are ten to thirteen years old. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now, and they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a few days. At the end of the week, they come to us and say thank you because they had a great time.

Sometimes, parents call a lot to ask about their child. This is not needed. Their child is often busy playing games or doing other things, so we tell the parents to call back later. We also see some children who wear expensive new clothes. These children sometimes argue when we ask them to change into other clothes, but soon they understand why."""
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show. It opened in London last year. Before that, it was in the USA for five years. It won the ‘Best Musical’ award four times in the USA! 

In London, the show has all-British actors. This was hard because young actors in the UK can only do a few shows each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. So, they needed more actors in London. The director found many talented actors in the UK, and they won their first ‘Best Musical’ award.

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA. It is full every night. Many people want to hear the songs from the show. I met Jamie, who is 11 years old and an actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with my beautiful Gibson guitar.’ 

Jamie told me that the young actors are very busy. They have school lessons at the theatre. He misses his old school friends. His whole class came to see the show. The theatre gives special ticket prices for schools. Jamie said his class loved the show, and this made him feel good. His parents come to see him when they can, but it is expensive for them.

When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found another guitar for me. We played a song called Days. I did not know this song, but Jamie helped me learn it. I was happy when I got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills. The young actors are already musicians, but none of them had played in a band before. They found it easy to play together. Jamie said the hard part was to look natural when they first performed. They were so focused that they forgot to smile!

The show will be in London for another year, and it is very good to see.'"
