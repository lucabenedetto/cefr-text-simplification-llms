Some time ago, a website discussed the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location – not all of whom you may want to meet. This highlights a growing understanding that there can be negative consequences to the constant sharing enabled by the internet. The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to wealth and fame. However, as we dive into the online world, sharing personal stories and photos, we may find ourselves in a crowded and risky environment.

This situation may seem discouraging, but there is hope. The future has been mapped out for us by early internet pioneers. In the beginning, these pioneers explored the internet and identified its dangers. They faced job losses, changes in friendships, and the challenges of fame long before social media existed. These early bloggers have experienced what many of us are now facing. It is important to learn from their experiences, as those who do not learn from history are likely to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the World Wide Web, which was mostly used by graduate students, scientists, and a few talented teenagers. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his life. He created a complex online autobiography filled with personal stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was straightforward: anyone who crossed his path could be featured on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some may see this as exhibitionism, there was also a unique beauty to his work that many would consider art.

However, one day, visitors to Hall’s site found his homepage replaced by a single, emotional video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog was removed, but the issue remains. Sharing online can be wonderful, but if you think that sharing your life will make people want to be around you, you may be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague shared the link to her blog with all the vice presidents at her company, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers who study online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes the feeling that we can say things online that we would never say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a few months, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once a symbol of the risks of online sharing, she has become skilled at managing her self-revelation. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, that doesn’t mean we should."
2,"Text: 'Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to suggest that there is much we do not understand about our universe. How can any scientist disagree with that? While scientists can sometimes be arrogant, even the most enthusiastic physicist would not claim to know everything about the cosmos. Nevertheless, some scientists felt it was necessary to warn the public about the film, using strong language to describe it, from calling it ‘atrocious’ to saying, ‘It is a very dangerous piece of work.’ Clearly, this film was generating a lot of attention. However, for the first twenty minutes, I did not understand why. Various scientists made harmless statements about how new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It was only when the film discussed some of these discoveries that I began to understand the excitement – discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. I had heard before about a Japanese researcher who claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the film only provided pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to by someone happy, and unattractive after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is simple and can easily evoke positive reactions from those who are not well-informed, like saying, ‘Hey, man, far out.’ But among scientists, the common reaction has been: ‘Give me a break.’ I understand their point. The idea that water can be influenced by thoughts is fascinating and has significant implications. However, without solid proof, we should be cautious. Pretty pictures of crystals, while nice, are not enough. The real issue is that the film’s claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules have properties due to a type of energy that seems to appear from nowhere, which may be connected to a force that is causing the universe to expand. The evidence for this is not just a few pretty pictures; it comes from years of research in labs and observatories worldwide. The truth is that discoveries are being made that confirm the film’s claim – the universe is indeed stranger than we could have imagined. Astronomers have discovered that the universe consists of an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy.’ Additionally, discoveries on a more practical level are equally surprising. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they occur – a delay we do not notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found the origin of modern humans and understand how and why they spread across the globe. Some theorists even suggest links between the existence of life on Earth and the fundamental design of the universe. Contrary to what some may think, science is not close to being complete. In fact, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever before. It is now clear that many natural phenomena cannot be understood as we once thought. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty have set limits on our knowledge. This has led some of the world’s top theoretical physicists to work on the so-called Theory of Everything, which aims to explain all the forces and particles of the universe in one equation. Beyond theories, many of us believe that the universe can be best described in one word: incredible.'"
3,"To put it simply, I find writing novels challenging, while writing short stories brings me joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. Both processes work together to create a beautiful landscape that I cherish. The trees provide shade, and the wind rustles their leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the gentle change of seasons.

Since I began my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I feel the urge to write short stories; once I complete a set of short stories, I want to focus on a novel again. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while creating short stories. The two types of writing seem to use different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I started my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I began writing short stories. At that time, I knew little about writing short stories, so it was challenging, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers appreciated this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, “Breaking Waves,” was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my beginning as a short-story writer.

One of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to complete. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can go on forever). It’s not the same level of commitment required for the year or two it takes to write a novel. I can go into a room, finish my work, and leave. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. Therefore, writing short stories provides a necessary change of pace.

Another great thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas—like a thought, a word, or an image. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, where the story leads me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can simply accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This thought comforts me. You can learn from your mistakes and apply that knowledge to your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories. In this way, short stories serve as a kind of experimental space for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment the way I like within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more challenging.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, faint traces of my journey. I remember exactly where I placed each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."
4,"At its most basic level, science connects with philosophy; at its most practical, it helps to cure diseases. Science has improved our lives but also poses threats to our existence. It seeks to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, from the smallest atom to the immense cosmos. Science has influenced poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often recognized only by those who study it deeply, while its dangers are frequently misunderstood. The significance of science has been both exaggerated and underestimated, and its mistakes, as well as those of its creators, are often overlooked or unfairly highlighted.

The journey to explain the physical universe has been marked by ongoing conflict. Established theories are often changed or completely rejected, similar to how new music styles are initially mocked before becoming accepted. The battle between old and new ideas is rarely respectful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. The history of science is fundamentally about conflict. This book presents science as a collection of ideas that have transformed not just science itself but also many areas of human thought. While science has practical benefits, our main focus will be on its ideas—appreciating their beauty, being amazed by creativity, but always ready to question them. We must recognize both the cleverness and the significant limitations of the human mind.

Science is inherently changeable. There is always a scientist somewhere disproving another's explanation. Usually, these changes do not disrupt society. However, sometimes, they can challenge our established beliefs. For example, in the seventeenth century, science introduced the idea of a mechanical universe, like a giant clock. Three hundred years later, physics began to question basic ideas, leading us into a complex situation where our observations can influence the universe, and we struggle to understand our fundamental concepts.

Some people view the instability of scientific theories as a sign that science cannot explain the universe. However, scientific changes often improve our ability to understand and predict natural events. The seventeenth-century scientist Isaac Newton could explain much more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein, the father of modern physics, could explain even more than Newton. Science may falter, but it continues to advance. 

It is important to remember that at the end of the nineteenth century, many physicists believed there was little left to discover in physics. Then came breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, the discovery of the electron and the nucleus, and many new fundamental particles, along with quantum mechanics and relativity. Biology has also made significant progress. Today, some claim that a complete theory explaining the universe's origins and workings is on the horizon. 

Science is not just a harmless intellectual activity. In the last two centuries, we have shifted from merely observing nature to controlling it in small but growing ways. Sometimes, we have disrupted nature in ways we do not fully understand. Science must be monitored. Non-scientists can no longer afford to remain uninformed about advancements that will shape the world their children will live in and the kind of future they will have. Science has become a crucial part of how humanity envisions and shapes its future. The questions about our future should not be left solely to philosophers, as the answers can impact national budgets, the health of future generations, and even the long-term survival of life on Earth."

Since around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had either stabilized or even decreased in some cases. This raised questions about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investment decisions, causing his company to lose faith in the value of traditional printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can coexist, the debate about whether ebooks will replace print books continues. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this idea, it is clear that the potential loss of printed books continues to spark our imagination and provoke strong discussions. 

Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we often see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium replacing another often arises with new technologies. Even before digital technology, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many believed that radio would disappear. However, radio adapted and found new ways to be used, such as in cars and factories. 

The idea that books might disappear is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated itself many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been thought to threaten print books as sources of culture and entertainment. Some believed that the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others, imagining a perfect digital future, exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. 

It is no coincidence that the idea of the death of the book appears during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our mixed feelings of hope and fear about new technology. To understand why these feelings are so common, we must recognize that we form emotional connections with different media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show that we develop strong attachments to objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or expressing frustration at our laptops. 

Therefore, the arrival of new technology, like e-readers, does not just signal economic and social change; it also forces us to rethink our relationship with something that has become a significant part of our daily lives. As technology evolves, we often find ourselves missing what we once knew but no longer have. This is why entire industries emerge around nostalgic products and older technologies. For instance, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe led people to seek out original manuscripts. The transition from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created a longing for the earlier format. The same nostalgia occurred with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. 

Not surprisingly, e-readers have sparked a renewed appreciation for the physical qualities of traditional books, even their unique smell. This should reassure those who worry about the decline of print books. However, the idea of disappearing media will continue to be an attractive story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we cope with change is by using familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and endings. The narrative of the death of the book is easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, ourselves."

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 AM, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I focused on the daily lives of these individuals – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers. I wanted to show that artists, like everyone else, have routines. The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I would add, “Tell me what time you eat and if you take a nap.” 

This book may seem superficial because it looks at the conditions for creativity rather than the creative work itself. However, it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about the writer. My main concerns in this book reflect my own struggles: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work on many things a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not claim to answer these questions definitively; some may only be resolved through personal compromise. Instead, I provide examples of how many successful people have faced similar challenges. 

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. Routines can seem ordinary and thoughtless, but they can also be powerful tools for managing limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can help direct our mental energy and reduce the impact of our moods. The psychologist William James believed that we should automate parts of our lives through good habits, allowing us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and maintaining a regular schedule himself. 

This book was inspired by my own procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, while working at a small architecture magazine, I was supposed to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself cleaning my workspace and making coffee. As a “morning person,” I can concentrate well in the early hours but struggle in the afternoon. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book. 

The blog was informal; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I have created a more detailed and researched collection while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I have let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I must acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."
7,"Text: Howard became a palaeontologist after a rise in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a large mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. On a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was not interested in the more famous areas like dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. Instead, he was fascinated by the very beginnings of life, studying small creatures found in grey rocks.

As he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would find a job, especially in the type of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but understood that deserving a position does not always guarantee getting it. When the Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London became available, he applied, though he did not have high hopes.

On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and the professor who replaced him was someone who disliked Howard’s former professor. This man managed to ensure that Howard got the job. Howard was surprised by this unexpected support and felt grateful until a colleague later explained the situation to him. Although it would have been nice to think he was chosen for his skills, what mattered most was that he had the job and could do the work he loved.

Howard often compared the organized nature of his professional life, where he could plan and execute his research, with the chaos of personal life. Many people can influence your life, and sometimes a stranger can unexpectedly change everything. This happened to Howard when his briefcase, containing notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he returned to college, made a phone call to postpone the lecture, and reported the theft. Afterward, he went for a coffee and met a colleague who was hosting a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This conversation led Howard to learn about a new collection of fossils that had not yet been catalogued. Studying these fossils would be his biggest challenge and secure his future in his profession. Because of the theft and the kind stranger, he quickly changed his plans. He decided not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Text: Charles Spence is open to trying many different foods. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they may look like maggots, they supposedly have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. One of the challenges Spence and his team face is making the idea of eating bugs more acceptable. Through his research on how our senses work together to create our perception of flavor, Spence is subtly influencing what we eat and drink. This includes the products of large food companies (he advises one well-known multinational and receives funding from another) and the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink in great detail, a field informally called gastro physics. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and weight of plates and cutlery, and background noise all affect our taste. Spence’s book, The Perfect Meal, co-authored with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting insights for anyone who enjoys food. For example, did you know that the person who orders first in a restaurant tends to enjoy their meal more? And we eat about 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others. 

Spence’s lab in Oxford is quite simple. He describes it as ""low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff."" It has soundproof booths that look like large safes, where he did much of his PhD work, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who cannot afford academic research. Much of his funding comes from a large food company. Historically, research funded by industry was seen as less serious in universities. However, since the government required universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research has become more accepted. Spence is currently helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Interestingly, many companies have been making these changes quietly, so consumers do not notice the difference. ""Research shows that when you inform people about changes, they focus on the taste and often dislike it more,"" he explains.

Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a major food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was unappealing, even though food is inherently scientific. Blumenthal helped change this perception. Their collaboration led to the creation of the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in Blumenthal’s five-star restaurant. Spence notes that early-twentieth-century Italian futurists experimented with sounds and food, but it did not become popular. Now, the food industry is applying Spence’s sensory science widely. For example, he found that higher-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. ""It’s surprising how shapes can affect taste, or how a tune can change your perception of flavor,"" he says. An airline plans to match music with the food served to passengers, and a well-known brand recently released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream melted, although they did not match the music to the taste, which is often the case.

What are dinner parties like at Spence's home? Once, they had rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they experimented with remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. ""We’ve had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and ten different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."

Our brains are working harder than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false information, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information. We must sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we handle most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage many responsibilities, including our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. These devices have become part of our busy lives, filling every spare moment. 

However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking—doing several things at once—this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, it costs us mentally. Instead of being expert jugglers, we are more like amateur plate spinners, hurriedly moving from one task to another, worried that we might drop something important. 

Even though we feel productive, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. It has been shown to increase stress hormones, which can lead to confusion and unclear thinking. Multitasking creates a desire for constant stimulation, rewarding our brains for losing focus. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to concentrate, can easily be distracted by new things, like shiny objects that attract children’s attention. 

This is ironic because the part of our brain we rely on to stay focused is easily sidetracked. Just the chance to multitask can harm our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this problem ""info-mania."" His research found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by tiredness. 

Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, discovered that learning new information while multitasking can lead to the information being stored incorrectly in the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information from their studies goes to a part of the brain meant for skills, rather than the part that organizes facts. Without distractions, the information is stored in a way that makes it easier to remember. 

Moreover, multitasking often involves making decisions: “Should I reply to this text or ignore it? How should I respond?” Decision-making is also challenging for our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can become mentally exhausted and may make poor choices about important matters. 

In discussions about information overload with business leaders and scientists, email is frequently mentioned as a problem. It is not that email itself is bad, but rather the overwhelming amount of messages we receive. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does, he said, “He answers emails.” His father agreed that this was quite accurate. We feel we must respond to emails, but it often seems impossible to do so while accomplishing anything else."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he acting out of spite? In caves in the US, female bats assist unrelated fruit bat mothers if they struggle to give birth. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, such questions were often considered unimportant. Animals displayed behaviors that led to measurable outcomes, and science focused on these results. The belief that animals possess consciousness, feelings, and moral systems was seen as overly sentimental. However, this perspective has begun to change. Research on the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has shifted the taboo around studying animal emotions, leading to a cautious exploration of the topic. This change has influenced popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". It has sparked a debate that may never be resolved: do animals have consciousness? This discussion raises another important question about conscience, which is a person's moral sense of right and wrong that influences their actions.

In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to access food showed more joy—by jumping and kicking—than those that had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what implications does this have for beef production and consumption? While the observations are not disputed, their interpretation is. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" argues that the logical response to this new research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the brink of a significant ethical revolution, similar to the abolition of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, suggests we should reconsider our understanding of animal cognition, stating that animals likely have a simpler theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail believes we should avoid attributing human emotions to animals. These three perspectives may never align because the core issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Given the difficulty of defining consciousness, can we truly understand, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks, what it is like to be a bat? 

Balcombe describes a significant experiment he conducted that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can experience depression. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other group was kept in small, bare cages. Initially, both groups learned to eat only from a box with tasty worms. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a poor environment made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights organizations, has a clear bias. He states, “We look back with horror at a time of racism. Our views on animals will eventually be the same. We cannot support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” If he were the only one advocating for this view of animal consciousness, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning has written a textbook titled ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He notes, “What we are witnessing is a shift in perspective. At the start of the 20th century, some believed animals thought like us, leading to a backlash. Now, we are moving back toward that idea. But it is a contentious topic, and we should be cautious of academics with strong personal opinions.”"

Critical thinking is a way of engaging with what we read or hear to gain a deeper understanding. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K. and a former computer science lecturer, notes that many believe arguing is a way to discover the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are growing worries that it changes how we solve complex problems and makes real thinking harder. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but appealing ideas, trends, and opinions. The vast amount of information can overwhelm our ability to think clearly. Ironically, having more data does not necessarily lead to better knowledge or decision-making. West highlights that the quality of our thinking has not improved much despite the increase in information.

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading has dropped by 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that the focus on visual media has a cost. She suggests that the decrease in reading may be linked to a decline in critical thinking. There is now more emphasis on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one task. However, we still do not have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. With the rise of technology, critical thinking has become more complicated, and scholars can no longer depend on the beliefs they once had.

It is easy to see technology, like computers and video games, as either good or bad, but the truth is that they can be both. Different technologies can lead to different outcomes. For instance, a computer game might help develop critical thinking or hinder it. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links may prevent deeper thinking. Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how people think. She observes that reading promotes thinking and imagination in ways that visual media, like video games and television, do not. Reading helps develop imagination, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can enhance some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are real-time and do not allow time for reflection or analysis. As a result, many people, especially younger individuals, may not reach their full potential.

How society views technology greatly influences its understanding of critical thinking. This conflict is especially clear in the area of video games and thinking skills. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games are not always harmful to children. In fact, they can be a valuable learning tool. Evidence shows that playing video games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging, virtual environments that mimic the real world. These games also allow players to explore ideas that might otherwise be difficult to access. As reading and math scores decline in the digital age, it is important to closely examine technology and understand how it affects thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy institutions. His first book was a thoughtful exploration of the advantages of manual trades. His latest book is a philosophical discussion on how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on a credit card machine during a brief delay while he entered his pin number. Crawford realized that these distractions are becoming harder to escape. What we want to focus on at any moment is very personal, but we are often unaware of how outside influences affect our choices. It is increasingly difficult to think clearly or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, we tend to isolate ourselves and may even stop doing simple things like talking to strangers. Crawford notes, “We increasingly encounter the world through representations that are often manipulative: video games, apps on our phones.” These representations reflect our desires perfectly and can take over our lives.

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many people know an office worker who complains about emails all day but spends their free time checking them. Research shows that our attention can wander if a phone is simply visible on the table—a common experience for those who have felt distracted at dinner by their phone. While there is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, there have been worries about this since the invention of the telegraph in 1837. However, it is clear that we are more aware of other things we could be doing. It is easy to blame technology for this crisis, but Crawford believes that technology has created perfect tools for our self-obsession. Living in a world of constant choices puts a strain on our self-control, which affects our social interactions. We often prefer to send a text message to a friend instead of risking a face-to-face conversation. By only interacting with representations of people rather than real people, Crawford argues that we may lose something essential in our society.

Screens are just part of the issue. He uses his gym as an example. There used to be one music player in the center of the room for everyone to share. People had different music tastes, which could create tension. Now, most people listen to their own music through earbuds. “The gym used to be a social place, but it has lost that quality. Real connections with others often happen through conflict—discussing different tastes and finding common ground,” he says.

Crawford suggests a two-part solution. First, we need to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled practices to connect with the world in a more fulfilling way. He mentions cooks, ice hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people whose jobs require them to interact with the physical world. No representation can match the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under your tires at high speed. Each of these roles demands good judgment and the ability to manage interactions with others in the same space. “When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences become less appealing compared to real involvement,” he says. “They lose some of their power.” This does not mean everyone should become a chef; rather, it is important to find ways to use your judgment. There are many benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and makes it harder to focus on what truly matters. In contrast, practicing attention on one thing can help improve your ability to pay attention to other things."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, as a philosopher, I find it a bit more complicated. Saying I am a philosopher can sound pretentious. It feels more acceptable to say I study or teach philosophy, but claiming to be a philosopher might suggest I have some special knowledge or truth that others do not. This idea is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else, but this stereotype makes me think twice before answering.

So, why do people have this view of philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who evaluate the actions of others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical living, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers fully agree with this, there is still a cultural belief that connects philosophy with deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting the norms of society can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to reflect on the world helps us take control of our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not require extensive reading of philosophical texts or a life focused solely on intellectual thought. It simply means paying closer attention to our everyday experiences to ensure they are meaningful. You do not need to be a wise person living apart from society to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is a key part of a good life.

Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more disconnected from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are linked to expensive academic journals, making it hard for philosophers to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. As a result, philosophy can seem distant from everyday life. While some philosophers once tried to change this view, many have stopped. The academic environment has encouraged this separation, and as philosophy has become more focused on specific, technical debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the area of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully capture my work, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and values. There is a new trend in philosophy where ethics is seen as applied ethics, which examines the fairness of specific social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ethical or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then move on to deeper questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people reflect on the practices and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we may confirm what we already know; other times, we may find that our beliefs are difficult to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we contribute to the benefit of everyone."

People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can enhance our enjoyment of food. However, historically, discussions about food in philosophy have often been secondary to other philosophical topics. When philosophers discuss eating, it often serves as a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, there are discussions that seem to be about food, but a closer look shows they are exploring different, loosely related ideas.

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who promoted the idea of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in various aspects of life. Despite this, Epicurus is often associated with a love for eating and drinking, as seen in the names of restaurants and food websites. Businesses likely hope to gain from this association with a well-known philosopher.

Food is inherently social and cultural. The food we eat comes from historical contexts and is shared within our communities. These communities provide us with dining companions and the systems through which food is produced and distributed. We interact with food more often and in more essential ways than with any other product, making it a clear subject for philosophical exploration.

Once food is prepared, critics begin to discuss it. But why do these critics hold such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, influential food critics are simply better at describing flavors. This area has been overlooked in philosophy, as most studies on perception focus on vision, which should change.

Another important aspect of food is its aesthetics. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the beauty of food's taste. Some philosophers argue that, with the growth of modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in discussions about aesthetics, similar to art or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike visual or auditory art forms, which remain. Therefore, it is incorrect to consider food a proper subject of aesthetic value.

There are also many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will question why we hold these beliefs, making such discussions about food worthwhile.

Additionally, there is a difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, based on love and friendship. In a home kitchen, everyone is included as they share food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have obligations to their employers and the food itself, meaning their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more about colleagues than friends.

A recent essay titled ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" explores how food and dining can help bridge cultural divides. This happens in two ways: first, by learning to enjoy the food of others, we can appreciate different cultures; second, sharing meals helps us form personal connections with people from other cultures, a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The essay is filled with engaging examples and stories that bring this aspect of food philosophy to life for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the United States, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he enjoyed as a child were no longer fun or challenging, which led him to think about how board games could change. He wondered if they could have a storyline and if choices made in one game could affect future games. He modified a classic game called Risk to create a new version called Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and long-standing rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Later, he was invited to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy received great praise, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story intact. To do this, they hire testers to see how the games play out. Jaime Barriga, a play-tester for SeaFall, said, “It takes a lot of time. The first few games might go well, but then after four or five games, it can start to fall apart, and by game six, it might be broken. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When he was developing the idea, Daviau thought it would appeal to a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was different and pretty good, but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I expected it to be successful with just a few people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest advancements in game design in recent years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than to learn a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.” Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of an unfolding adventure outweighed any worries about the game’s longevity. He mentioned, “At first, I was worried about making changes and possibly ruining my board, but that concern was eased by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice in the cinema, do they? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling aspect similar to video games.”

The legacy format is influenced not only by video games but also by the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and then game design. Still, he loved storytelling. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but just having an outline is not enough.” While Daviau feels a sense of ownership over the idea, he is curious to see how others will develop it. However, he also tries to downplay its importance, thinking that gamers will soon ask, “What’s next?” Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less certain. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."

Not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like something from a children’s movie, became popular online. Part of the enjoyment of such escape stories, which also include animals like rats and llamas, is the idea that animals are similar to us. This is especially true for octopuses, whose intelligence is surprising given their very different bodies. How can these eight-armed sea creatures open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways?

Some people think that comparing animals to humans is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually a mistake to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this mistake ""anthropodenial."" After studying many years of research on animal intelligence, he shows that, except for fully developed language, animals display many behaviors once thought to be unique to humans. These include the ability to think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand the intentions of others. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often believe.

De Waal thinks that anthropodenial is a recent trend. In medieval and early modern Europe, people believed that animals had enough intelligence to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. One naturalist, Charles Darwin, noted that the difference between human minds and those of higher animals is one of degree, not kind. This view changed in the twentieth century with the rise of behaviorism, which focused on training animals through rewards and punishments. During this time, many people viewed animals as simple machines or robots, and those who believed animals had inner lives were often dismissed as unrealistic.

This change in thinking coincided with a time when humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly. Fortunately, de Waal believes we are starting to recognize animal intelligence again. He notes that there has been a surge of knowledge about animal cognition in recent years, especially shared online. He argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits and skills of each species. For example, while squirrels may struggle with human memory tasks, they can easily remember where they hid their nuts.

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might focus on how many color patterns we can create on our skin. If we failed this test, the octopus might think we are not very smart. De Waal is cautious about Inky’s escape story. He believes that while octopuses have escaped before, it is unlikely that Inky intentionally found a drain to reach the ocean. However, he understands how powerful viral stories can be in increasing our appreciation for animal intelligence.

De Waal conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can feel envy. When the monkeys received either cucumbers (a food they like) or grapes (which they prefer), those who got cucumbers became upset when they saw others receiving grapes. The study was published in a well-known scientific journal, but what really made people believe the findings was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This highlights the unique way our minds work."

Robotics, once a topic of science fiction, is now set to cause major changes in technology, similar to the impact of industrialisation. While robots have been used in car manufacturing and other industries for many years, experts believe we are approaching a crucial moment where robots will be used in many more areas. However, many people are not ready for this change. 

Most people see robotic automation as a disruptive force. Interestingly, about two-thirds of people think that robots will take over most jobs currently done by humans in the next 50 years. Yet, around 80% believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not. Every industry will be affected by robotic automation soon.

For instance, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X, which can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This task would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is Tally, a robot from a San Francisco startup, which moves through supermarket aisles to check that products are well-stocked and correctly priced, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation often mention that robots currently cannot repair or program themselves. This could lead to new, skilled jobs for technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not forget the importance of human skills in the workplace. They believe society is not ready for the changes that losing the human touch will bring.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how this technology is changing the workforce. His recent report indicates that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work safely with humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field are expected to rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers.

Zhang emphasizes that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes that these workers should not rely on the government to protect their jobs but should seek ways to retrain themselves. People can no longer expect to do the same job for their entire lives.

Additionally, advancements in motion control, sensors, and artificial intelligence will lead to new types of robots for consumers—robots that can live with us and interact in more complex ways, similar to those seen in science fiction. Zhang sees this as a great opportunity for companies ready to embrace these changes, but it also brings challenges, such as the need for new regulations to ensure safety and privacy.

With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is essential to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce that will include robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is often quoted as saying he wanted to climb Mount Everest ""because it’s there."" This response reflects a common question people have: why would anyone risk their life to climb such dangerous mountains? Mallory's answer might inspire some to pursue their dreams, suggesting that adventure and fun could be the main reasons for climbing. 

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He identified seven different climbing activities, from bouldering to climbing high peaks, each with its own rules. He argued that the style of climbing depends on the rules of the specific activity. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and casual conversations. 

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing brings. However, climbing can also feel restrictive. For instance, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing. Yet, some argue that having limited options can simplify a climber's life, which can also feel like a form of freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is part of our nature; we are wired to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing may be more about our biology than logical reasoning.

US academic Brian Treanor also contributed to this discussion. He argues that climbing can help develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are especially important in today's risk-averse society. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits, helping people develop qualities that allow them to thrive in everyday life.

Another interesting idea is that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that independent climbs, which are often harder and riskier, deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or artificial aids like bottled oxygen. However, this view may have encouraged some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also explore climbing outside the Western perspective. Many climbers report experiences of being fully present, or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, the meditative state while climbing, and intuitive problem-solving are all key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of peace. This offers another perspective on why people are drawn to climbing."

For over sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel established a strong presence in classical music. He was an intellectual and sometimes serious person who explored and recorded important European piano works. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he taught very few students. Those who knew him well saw a playful side to him, but this was rarely shown during his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after one of his concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist: “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, something about the 14-year-old boy caught his attention. When Brendel listened to Kit play, he was impressed. Brendel said, “He played remarkably well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a recital he had performed, and it was so beautiful that I thought, ‘I must make time for him.’ It was a performance that connected every note. It’s rare to find a musician with such a complete understanding and subtlety.”

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to make his own mark, though Brendel worries about him burning out too soon. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps a close watch on him. He also composes music. Brendel emphasizes, “This is very important. Learning to read music is easier when you try to write your own. I noticed that Kit has an incredible memory and is an excellent sight reader. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and is sensitive to sound. He understands my explanations and can apply them throughout a piece.”

Brendel pauses and becomes serious. “I don’t want to raise expectations. I get upset when newspapers do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century, which is very unhelpful. It can be damaging. Like many talented young musicians, he can play some pieces extremely well, while others need more time and practice. It would be harmful if a critic expected perfection.”

Now at 80 years old, Brendel shows a softer side in his retirement. He explains, “When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous in five years. I wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I reached 50, I felt I had accomplished most of those goals, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Although I may not have the physical strength now, my mind is always active with many pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform anymore, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.”"
20,"Text: ""When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandfather’s garden was by a river, sloping gently down to the water. Although I couldn’t reach the river, I could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and a place to escape. 

Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors, who used old window frames and patched them with plastic where glass was broken. At home, my father was often quiet. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed using phrases like ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ even though ‘I don’t mind’ would have worked just as well. Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it never happened. 

He was skilled at home projects, whether it was building bookshelves or cupboards. My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother later why I wasn’t given the chance, she simply said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

Of the three options – moors, woods, or river – I always chose the river. I could escape into my imagination there. With a fishing net over my shoulder and old sandals on my feet, I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a place to take off my sandals and search for fish. After failing to keep them alive in the backyard, I returned them to the water.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until one day my father said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, he went against his usual judgment. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think he saw my enthusiasm for gardening. Even though he didn’t enjoy gardening himself, I believe he noticed my passion for plants and flowers."""
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I do the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic threatens to blow us off the steep cliff at our feet and into the bay 120 meters below, where the ocean waits. Then MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, approaches, and his blond, bearded owner gently strokes him. Despite the howling wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. He shows me around his neighborhood. Pointing to the north, he shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s large mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, MacEwen says, “I have sheep to move,” as rain starts to drift towards us. We walk down the slopes, and he shares some facts about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3,000 years. While herding the sheep, Tie, the sheepdog, struggles to do his job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” MacEwen commands, meaning the dog should circle to the right. Instead, Tie goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says, disappointed. The dog looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mainly a MacEwen family operation. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats on summer days. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry.” However, island life has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I anxiously wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I manage without electricity and without mobile phone service. “There is mobile reception on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days, then just put their phone away.” So I do the same.

Everything on Muck feels wonderfully surprising. The boat today brings some groceries and three musicians, who jump off carrying their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a great success, with the islanders tapping their feet to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen shares how he met his wife, Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay advertised in the newspaper and bought it without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know anything about running a farm? “She had good typing skills.”

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the tiny island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, incredibly delicious. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to my next island. Over the past two months, many scheduled ferries had been canceled due to rough seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I longed for."

The game design industry was once mainly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals, and it did not offer many ways to enter. Often seen as just a hobby for young people, the video games industry is now taken seriously. This may surprise some, but industry experts are not surprised. However, entering this field is not easy. Video game spin-offs that come out quickly after a new movie need many team members and require months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it can be difficult to break into, but it is growing.

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, ""It is very hard to make progress in big companies or to influence major mainstream games. But the industry needs game designers now more than ever. Not just top-level directors who manage entire games, but also those who design systems and individual elements.""

So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim disagrees. ""There is only one way: make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed independently if you are not making things. Game design is more than just a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, it must be practiced to be real.""

Another expert, John Field, offers different advice. ""While 'just doing it' is important, it is more complicated than that. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements today. Even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit needed to truly contribute to this evolving field.""

Can you succeed on your own? ""Maybe, but it is quite difficult,"" says John. ""A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide valuable support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and have a strong passion for the arts and contemporary culture. They may have spent some time working after graduation but have realized that games are their true passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in this medium. 

Finally, networking can be very helpful. This is often overlooked, but to advance in games, as in many other fields, you need to make connections.""

The stereotype of a young boy playing video games has changed. Now, video games are seen as a serious medium that captures the attention of many. Families often engage with interactive consoles, and smartphones offer a wide range of new games through apps and social media. John believes there is much room for growth. ""Games have become popular among larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this already significant area as full of new possibilities and opportunities."""
23,"Text: ""Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very demanding. He often said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I’m glad that didn’t happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score great goals by practicing. The best players in the world, who have natural talent, still need years of practice to succeed. Sometimes young players collide on the field, but I learned the right techniques. When I teach kids, I focus on helping them enjoy learning skills. At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, football was my main focus. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that his habit of kicking the books around doesn’t mean he will be like me in that way. 

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could join the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He didn’t gather us and say, ‘This is your chance to prove yourselves,’ but we all understood the importance. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a well-known TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his comments. I depend a lot on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes create issues. For instance, people often ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents financially; I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and I think they would be upset if they felt they should rely on me completely. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to help those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, and it doesn’t solve all my problems. After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I retire. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg while skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."""
24,"Text: 'We were living at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. Out of desperation, he offered to find us a cheap place to live. My father struggled to write while we were in Los Angeles, and Sam risked losing clients and money. 

During the summer, the beach was often empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point was not popular with day visitors. The road was uninviting, and the nearby resort of La Carmella attracted those with money. Only people who were broke or really loved surfing would come the last mile to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, the beach was full of people and activities. My father was busy trying to finish a script, and he was in a bad mood. 

Most days, I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to send him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but it was just a weak attempt to scare him off. Rusty knew this and got closer. I asked my father, ‘Who does he belong to?’ My father replied, ‘You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.’

Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He liked to swim too and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim faster. Surprisingly, he never got discouraged.

That day, after swimming, my father drove to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed to never get tired. One surfer stood out to me; she was very skilled. Eventually, she decided to come in on a final wave. 

“Hi,” she said, “why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, Tall as the Morning?” I nodded. 
“I read that book cover to cover.” 

She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that people were friendly but only showed real interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning.'"

""What have I done?"" Violet Hetherington wondered. She was in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line was spilling out of the cattle shed marked ‘Departures’, and no one was moving. Her friend Annie, who was experienced in travel, had told her, ""It's best to arrive late. If you get there too early, you’ll just be waiting around."" But this time, Annie's advice was wrong. 

After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a ""breakdown in the computer system."" This news made the atmosphere among the waiting passengers tense. Some tried to be patient, while others attempted to stay cheerful, but most people became frustrated. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and many felt it might be their last chance for a bit of luxury. The fact that they could not board efficiently did not bode well. 

Violet felt like leaving. She reached into her bag for her phone, only to find it was missing. This was more annoying than the long wait. It made her feel that the whole idea of going on a cruise was a mistake. Now, she couldn’t call the minicab company to check if she had left her phone in the taxi because all her important numbers were stored in it. This was the very mistake her older son, Harry, always warned her about. 

Behind her in the queue stood a friendly-looking couple. ""I'm sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make a quick call?"" Violet asked. She called Harry using their phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbor, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t there, she would be in trouble since she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, ""Thank goodness,"" but she didn’t share this with Harry. He believed he was more worldly wise than his mother, while her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes because he made them too. Dan might forget to pass on the message to Kristina.

Eventually, the line began to move, and Violet approached a window to hand over her travel documents and prepare to board. Her heart sank further when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a not-so-grand hotel trying too hard. There were shiny fake wood panels, extravagant chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets that looked like those found in airports. 

Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’, which were lined with mirrors and packed with tired passengers who might have preferred not to see their reflections. She was squeezed against the side of the lift as it moved up, stopping at each floor to let people out. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out into freedom. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to ensure she had a view of the sea."

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he discovered 30,000 photographs taken by Maier, a talented street photographer known for her striking images. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm films and audiotapes.

One morning, Maloof looked around at his collection, realizing he was on the brink of something significant, all due to luck. “When I bought this, I had no idea what it was,” he said. “I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together details of Maier’s life. They reached out to families who had employed her as a nanny and spoke with staff from the shop where she developed her film.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be a private person with a unique personality, always carrying a camera. She wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, the camera was always around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “I remember her as a private person but someone with strong opinions about movies and politics.”

Maier was knowledgeable about theater and film. Although she was not very social, she would walk the streets with her camera and engage with people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “She didn’t let anything stop her.” Maier’s work is pure art; she did not create it for commercial reasons. Her photographs often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects.

“What is fascinating about Vivian is the number of interesting pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style independently. “Was Vivian sophisticated enough to do this, or did she borrow ideas from those before her?” Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever sort through all the negatives, which he has stored in three tall, fireproof cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof began taking his own pictures.

“As I improved as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known and to get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often suggests that it has not fully succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK during a time when her book was very successful, and she was at the center of a lot of media attention. Despite being in her twenties, she appeared calm. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. 

She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass, and the official asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have occurred, leading a council of 12 men to come together to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past provided many opportunities for her characters to face complications and misunderstandings. 

At over 800 pages, the book is “big by necessity” because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair chance to shine. When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded thoughtfully. “It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. There’s a family-like feeling at home; I received a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.” She also mentioned that it annoys her when people assume her book is not a philosophical work.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part being half the length of the previous one. This structure makes the story speed up as it progresses. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said, “I wanted to create a book with structural patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could find them.” Despite its experimental structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Interestingly, she did not plan the story in advance. “I would write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be in getting out of that situation,” she said. 

One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers. We also discussed her love for television dramas, noting how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would consider screenwriting. “That could be pretty cool,” she replied, her enthusiasm evident. She became animated when discussing her writing and New Zealand. “I notice that when I come to Britain, the landscape of my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for more populated areas, to experience the energy of other people.” For now, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."

As a boy, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either building things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has made a living by handcrafting steel-string acoustic guitars. He expresses his fascination with the guitar, wondering how two pieces of wood can create such beautiful sounds and how different types of wood can change the sound. Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at the age of eleven and later wanted to learn the bass guitar when he was sixteen. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to build it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood affect sound and how to combine them.

The bass guitar was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he had been making model boats and planes with his brothers for a long time. His father taught them how to use tools, and Jonny had also customized and repaired instruments for his friends. Although his bass guitar turned out well, he hadn’t thought about a career in guitar-making at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture, so after finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. He liked design, and being an architect seemed like a good choice. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out because he felt too different from the others. 

Leaving university helped him realize that guitar-making was a form of sculpture that involved creating sound. He thought it might be a more practical career than pure art because he would be making things that people use. Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he worked part-time cleaning windows to support himself. His early guitars were sold for just the cost of materials, but as he gained a reputation as a skilled guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, after almost forty years, Jonny describes his work as “still scratching a living.” He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the beginning, it was important for him to get known. He attended music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and encourage them to spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, as he initially struggled with this aspect of the business. Jonny believes that it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, many people thought that only American-made acoustic guitars were valuable, even though the UK has always had good instrument-making courses. Now, UK-made guitars have gained the recognition they deserve.

Jonny thinks that valuable skills can be learned in classes, and he encourages new instrument-makers to take these courses. However, he also believes that there is no substitute for learning through experience. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and what doesn’t. For example, if the back of a guitar is too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. He believes that being self-taught allows you to learn in many different ways, while being taught by someone else may limit you to just one method."

When discussing English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a common tradition, and I will quote the famous 18th-century writer Dr. Johnson, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This statement is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many commentators stop here or struggle to explain why the English seem so focused on the weather. They often make a mistake by thinking that our discussions about the weather are genuinely about the weather itself. They believe that English people talk about the weather because they find it interesting.

For instance, the American writer Bill Bryson points out that English weather is not particularly exciting. He notes that in England, we do not experience extreme weather events like tornadoes or blizzards, which are common in other places. In response, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that English weather is indeed interesting. He believes that the English fascination with the weather is not about strong feelings; rather, it is about its unpredictability. He states that while we may not have tropical storms, living on the edge of an ocean means we can never be sure what the weather will be like.

From my research, I believe that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point: our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not genuine questions about the weather; they are common greetings or ways to start a conversation. In this sense, English weather talk is similar to ""social grooming"" among monkeys, who spend time grooming each other to bond socially.

There are specific situations where weather talk is used. Some writers claim that English people talk about the weather all the time, but this is not accurate. In reality, there are three main contexts for weather talk: as a simple greeting, as a way to break the ice before discussing other topics, or as a fallback topic when conversations stall and there is an awkward silence. This frequent use of weather talk can give outsiders the impression that English people are obsessed with it. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, include some ice-breaking weather talk, and then return to weather topics when the conversation slows down. This is why many people, including some English commentators, think that English people must be very interested in the weather."
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of the remains of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 meters high around 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip, choosing it over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they wanted to know why the Wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to provide context about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching for 31 years, Alice began her new career as an author in 2001. 

Having had a successful teaching career, Alice felt she was taking a big step into the unknown. She compared teaching to acting, saying it was physically demanding, while writing was exciting but less exhausting. Her former colleagues envied her because she still connected with children through her fiction. Alice’s main goal for her novels is to fill a gap in children’s literature. She noted that much of today’s adolescent fiction focuses on negative experiences, which, while well-written, often presents dark realities or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books aim to be different.

Alice always taught English and History together, using lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel ""Tale of Troy."" She is motivated by her love for children and is fascinated by the moment when a child goes from being bored to interested, and from not understanding to understanding. She enjoys the challenge of engaging bored children. 

Her decision to write her first novel was inspired by the realization that her two sons were leaving home, creating an ""empty nest,"" and a suggestion from her head teacher to attend a creative writing course. Initially, Alice was hesitant, thinking she didn’t need the course after 25 years of teaching. However, she had to submit her best piece of fiction to be accepted, and just days before the course, she quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their unborn child. After three hours and 30 pages, she submitted it and was accepted.

During the course, her classmates analyzed her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing ability, she asked her school’s head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help in editing her novel was crucial. Alice believes they complement each other; he focuses on improving her writing, while she tends to add more scenes. This difference highlights the roles of a fiction writer and an editor."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to participate in a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and rugged Yorkshire Dales in northern England. 

As they prepared to start, Jonny expressed his excitement, saying, “I’ve never done anything like this before! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I’ll be warm in the car.” Alistair, dressed in full winter cycling gear, was also eager. He joked about Jonny’s driving skills, saying, “I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.”

The race began at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would finish at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high. While the car could handle the distance easily, Alistair faced a tough start with a steep incline. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair quickly sped away on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and started driving. The question was, who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence was quickly challenged. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he encountered a large tractor blocking the road. He complained to the cameraman, “If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair struggled with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the slope, passing walls and fences, while sheep watched him curiously.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. With the sun shining and open land ahead, he began to pick up speed. Meanwhile, Jonny faced another challenge. The narrow roads in the villages of Yorkshire were not designed for fast driving. He had to slow down to navigate a tight corner and then drive through a stream that had formed on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he raced towards the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close they were to each other. As Jonny accelerated down the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard, and as he reached the finish line, he suddenly stopped and looked up, asking the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in celebration, shouting, “Yes!”

Moments later, Jonny arrived in his car and stepped out. “Well done,” he said, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your own shot. The well-kept grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a calm atmosphere that protects you from the outside world. This silence helps my game. What I struggle with most in a tennis match is to focus only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence of Centre Court is broken by loud applause and cheers when a point ends. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t realize that there are fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused that I don’t think about the millions watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing with my friends my dream of playing there one day and winning. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not too hard. I was just happy to have made it that far after turning twenty. Federer won easily, more easily than if I had believed in myself more. But my loss in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have done better; it was not my skill that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and let it slip away. Toni, who is usually tough on me, surprisingly told me there was no reason to cry and that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand; I felt this was my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment matters, but some moments matter more, and I had missed a big one in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to ease my pain. However, he turned out to be right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat; this time, my mindset would be strong. The best sign that I was ready was my belief that I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we avoided talking about the match. I didn’t tell them not to mention it, but they understood that I was already mentally preparing for the game. From that moment until the match started, that mental space was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always longed for.” This woman was Jane Goodall, and she would spend most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, the National Geographic Society in Britain helped make her famous by publishing articles and documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including popular children’s books and the 1971 bestseller *In the Shadow of Man*, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on sentimental aspects and do not fully capture her work. She has been portrayed in various ways: as an adventurous girl, a privileged woman who wanted to live with wild animals, and a determined feminist. These portrayals can diminish her true contributions. 

Based on the number of academic references to her research, the success of her students in biology, and the extensive data from her forty-year study, Jane Goodall should be recognized as a pioneering zoologist. More simply, she opened our eyes to the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or that they used tools, like humans. We also did not realize that chimpanzees share similar emotions with us or that their social structures are surprisingly similar to ours. Goodall discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have unique cultural traditions. Her book, *The Chimpanzees of Gombe* (1986), is the most important work in chimpanzee research and serves as the first encyclopedia on the subject. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and influenced how we view ourselves as humans.

Even as a child, there were signs of the person she would become. One clear example happened in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, Jane disappeared, and her family called the police to help find her. After a frantic search, she reappeared alone, with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had crawled into a henhouse, hidden in the straw, and stayed still for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."

In our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of a playful 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to fans of children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she explains, “so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.” 

Shirley shares what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even well-known ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there’s more to it. You need to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions because of their fame, but often they don’t get the roles because they are too used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a traditional acting career. During the course, she occasionally worked singing jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she recalls, “the studio manager suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors often provide the voices for young boys and girls because their voices are lighter than those of male actors. Hiring child performers involves complicated procedures and many forms, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds and to vary her voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for voiceover work is intense, and having a good showreel – a recording that showcases what an artist can do – is crucial. “It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley advises. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her field through determination as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also believes a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll speak like that for hours, maybe even days,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in completely different voices.”"
35,"Text: ""People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many dream about as children, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and choose more practical careers, such as tax lawyer or auto parts manufacturer. The idea of making a living by drawing simple doodles, like those in high school notebooks, seems unrealistic. Yet, some people do just that. 

Becoming a cartoonist is not the same for everyone, but most who succeed have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist, with a love for comic strips, contributions to school publications, and being known as ‘the kid who draws.’ I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to various companies. I was fortunate to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, and they bought them. Within a few months, I was earning enough to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even advanced drawing skills. You just need your mind, your hand, and something to make marks with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. While the technical requirements are low, it is still a challenging job. No one should try to become a cartoonist unless they feel they cannot do anything else. It is much easier to find a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living from your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I accept various jobs because you can learn a lot from work you may not enjoy. It also helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

Now, let’s talk about the business side of cartooning. There was a time when many cartoonists could find steady jobs with different newspapers and magazines. However, those days are fading. For most people today, cartooning is an entrepreneurial activity, meaning you must not only create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with this process, the more successful you will be. 

I have seen many cartoonists with average creativity but strong business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack other skills. It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ circle it, and write your name and the date next to it. But realistically, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If, by chance, someone steals a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it could actually be a lucky opportunity!"""

It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of even useless items, so why did I want to throw this one away? I took it to the dump and was about to leave it on a pile of trash when a young man approached me, looking confused. 'You’re not really going to throw that away, are you?' he asked. I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could take it, and I said 'Yes.' We parted ways, but in the following days and years, I felt a deep sadness about my decision.

Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it ten years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened this email from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer and restorer named Keith Rushton. He told me, 'I’ve got your electric guitar.' It had been sold and resold many times since the young man at the dump took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back of the guitar. He realized it was probably outdated but used my name to find me online. He eventually contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was overwhelmed with emotion. I would have given him anything he wanted, but his price was very reasonable. I had forgotten that my dad always put name-and-address stickers on my belongings, including my guitar. I could imagine how my dad would have laughed at this strange situation!

My parents had encouraged me to learn classical guitar when it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the calming sound of the instrument, which was forgiving to beginners. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound terrible when played by someone just starting out. However, I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar and played simpler music. This was also the time of punk music, where anyone could be a rock star, even if they weren’t great musicians.

When I opened the box that Keith sent me and took out my old guitar, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and familiar, though smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play but quickly stood up, putting a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are meant to be played standing. My fingers instinctively knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for the chords I wanted to play, but my hands remembered. My middle-aged fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to form a chord. The electric guitar is not really meant for solo playing. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or perhaps there are others my age who have had similar experiences. We could call ourselves 'The Regainers!'"""

Recently, there has been much discussion about sleep. When I wrote my book, Insomniac, which focuses on people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and emotions. Anyone who has trouble sleeping will tell you that sleep is essential for our mental, physical, and social health. Interestingly, those who find it hardest to sleep often understand its importance the most. It is encouraging that sleep is finally receiving the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. There hasn’t been much talk about them. We often lose our dreams. When you wake up early, missing the last hour or two of sleep, you mainly lose REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which is when we have the most vivid dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, meaning that someone who lives to be 90 years old will spend around six or seven years dreaming. When researchers prevent people from experiencing REM sleep, they find that the next night, the amount and intensity of REM sleep increases to make up for it. This suggests that dreams serve a purpose. 

When REM sleep was discovered in 1953, many agreed with the psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the focus shifted to the physical reasons behind dreams rather than the psychological ones. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are significant. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams much better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as film is one of the most dream-like forms of human expression. However, I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? 

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from our past and present to create new associations. Dreams may help us discover new patterns and combinations that challenge our usual ways of thinking. For instance, Stickgold found that when people are awakened from REM sleep and asked to respond to a specific word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They tend to ""ignore the obvious"" and combine ideas in unexpected ways, which is a form of creativity. Personally, I find that I write better after intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely recall, seems to inspire my thoughts. On those days, words and images flow so quickly that I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t fully understand how this happens, but it does seem to work. 

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and everyone needs their brains to function well. We must think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to move to a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, which has a stunning view of the sea, you see several empty frames on the walls, along with smiling photos of her two daughters. As a leading artist in the copyist art movement, who can recreate the beauty of early 20th-century impressionist paintings and 16th-century Caravaggio portraits, it seems unusual that she doesn’t keep any of her own work. “I don’t have any of my own lying around,” Susie says with a shrug. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” The reason is that Susie is in high demand. Over her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by many famous artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings could sell for millions at auctions, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal most of her clients, even when asked, but they include galleries and private collectors. While many collectors genuinely love art, some are motivated by status. One celebrity enjoys showing off his ‘Van Gogh’ painting, which is actually a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank safe and displaying Susie’s copy instead. 

Susie has always been transparent about her work. When she reproduces a classic masterpiece, she aims to make it look as authentic as possible, believing that doing it poorly would disrespect the original artist. However, she does sign her name on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as the real thing is illegal, and although she knows people who have profited from that, she has never been tempted. Those who create fakes often face serious consequences. Susie points out that she isn’t wealthy and has faced challenges, but her situation is more stable now, and it wouldn’t be wise to risk her reputation with collectors and artists. 

Susie didn’t always work as a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. Looking back, she sees that experience as valuable for her current work and it sparked her love for plants, even though it was hard to make ends meet. She explains that she had to be very precise and get things right on the first try. She has no regrets about that time, but she is happy to have found a more financially rewarding career. When younger artists ask her for advice, she emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to master her craft. Her training allows her to create everything from plant drawings to perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces and 20th-century abstract art, although she now focuses on French impressionists, particularly Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 

Susie mentions that many people think modern art is simple, almost like child’s play. However, she believes that impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very careful, and that combination is challenging to achieve. Given her skills, it seems strange that Susie doesn’t create her own original art. Isn’t art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She explains that her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own pieces, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—acceptable, but not better than that. Perhaps it’s like living on plain food after enjoying meals prepared by a top chef. The key thing about Susie is that she is a perfectionist."
39,"Text: 'During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest on it. This obsession began in her childhood. She felt a unique connection with the boats that took her around the world; they worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life felt unimportant. People would ask her about the race, but she longed to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had almost defeated her.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she showed me the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher. This was her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She explained how carefully she planned her supplies, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial for her. She proudly displayed her unappealing stock of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her attention to detail in keeping the boat was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her entire world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, she views the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, and fragile thing with limited resources. A significant moment for her was a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she assisted in a bird survey of albatrosses. This experience made her reflect and see things differently. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. She felt it showed how we take what we want and move on without thinking.

When I visited Ellen’s office, she was finishing a tense conference call. She explained why we must act now to protect the planet. “We no longer create coal, oil, or gas. They are valuable resources we have only once. We need to find ways to use them wisely.” Initially, her message was negative—encouraging people to use less—but she later realized there was a more positive approach. Now, she focuses on reusing materials, passionately discussing items like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, speaking with government and business leaders about our dependence on non-renewable resources. “I will never be an expert,” she admits. “But I am like a sponge, absorbing information. The current situation is something I cannot ignore. Compared to sailing, this feels less selfish. It’s about discovering how my voice can be most effective. It truly matters.”

She also founded the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that collaborates with businesses and educational institutions to inspire young people to rethink and create a sustainable future. “I do miss the adventure of being at sea,” she confesses. “It defines who I am. You feel connected to everything around you, and there’s no time to feel lonely. You focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message is more complex than just saying: ‘I want to be the fastest around the world.’ I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I’ve ever done.”'"
40,"Text: Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his time. He hopes to inspire other young people to explore the outdoors, especially since many spend a lot of time on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero,"" and climbing Everest is just part of their plan. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before turning thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might complete the challenge before he finishes his teenage years.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They agreed that while a young climber might be physically strong, they doubted whether a teenager would have the emotional strength needed. They also questioned how a young person could have enough experience to make the right decisions and react properly in dangerous situations.

The Romeros are aware of these concerns. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can't focus on it – we have so much to do. I think about the possible problems, of course. Karen and I constantly assess the risks, but we believe our experience as climbers will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming very strong and mature."" 

I also wonder about Jordan's motivation. Is this just an ambitious father pushing his son too far? Paul insists, ""This project is not about me wanting to be famous through my son's achievements. At first, Jordan thought it was something to do later in life, but we discussed it and decided, 'Why not now?' We talk to him regularly to ensure he still wants to do it.""

When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ""I just focus on achieving my goal."" In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting event. The more daring the record, the more interest it attracts. This creates a challenge for Jordan. While we may feel that achievements often overshadow enjoyment, if he wants to inspire others, he must engage with the media. This means blogging, posing for photos, and giving interviews. He needs to offer something impressive, like climbing Everest. Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop mountain climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I have just started a music degree, but my classmates know as little about classical music as most people our age. If someone doesn’t know who composed a piece, they probably don’t own any recordings of it. This situation must be disappointing for classical music lovers. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only about 300 copies. I find that hard to believe. 

So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games for this decline, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are not the majority. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music listening is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, can be challenging for us. We prefer fast conversations, quick actions, and rapid thoughts. Experts say we struggle to pay attention for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Additionally, pop music often deals with topics that interest teenagers, while classical music usually does not. 

The way we listen to music has also changed. In the past, families would gather to play music together, and playing an instrument was highly valued. Now, we can find any music we want online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that audiences at classical concerts have increased recently. Maybe, but I doubt many of those new attendees are teenagers. In my orchestra, we perform classical music in various places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more people are drawn to classical concerts as they age, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people blame schools for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many students are eager to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it’s not their preferred music outside of that. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you regret I came here,” she said to the school, with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie wouldn’t have minded if she had. Her mother understood how Bonnie felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings scattered among the trees on a hillside; it was quite confusing at first. Then she noticed the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved through the trees. “I wish you’d walk next to me instead of behind me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t seem to expect Bonnie to do so. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be kicked out soon anyway, so why not get it over with?” She left the building and went towards the riding centre, following the sign. 

There was a charming old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses with a sense of respect. The horses were well cared for, and she noticed that immediately. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, carefully observing each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best of the bunch!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. It can’t be far.” 

Bonnie was thrilled to find that the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. As she focused on putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she climbed onto the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in control of everything around her. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I’m serious, I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling exhilarated as a gentle breeze brushed against her cheek. She sensed that Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"Text: 'I have met Cody Simpson before and have always admired his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? “I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven,” Cody recalls, explaining how it all started. “But I was swimming and surfing every day. Those activities were more important to me back then; I had a full life and many things to do. When I was 13 and in high school, I posted a few videos online.” These videos changed everything. He began by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos. Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The response was overwhelming. Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with top coaches and focused on improving his skills. But then record labels showed interest, and he faced a difficult choice: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the leap. “It was very hard for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. “It surprised most people. I’m the quiet kid,” he says, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy industry.” So Cody packed his bags and traveled halfway around the world with his family, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and is not directly involved in his career, they support him from behind the scenes. Cody believes it’s important to have a close circle of good people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, everyone has moments of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old, and he’s traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how that affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.” Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big opportunity, even when it feels a bit scary. “It all happened so quickly and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m visiting countries I never thought I would see and performing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s something many people dream of achieving. But I know it won’t last forever.”"

I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I had worked long hours with most of the town’s adults, showing that I could handle the job. My grandfather, however, didn’t seem to notice. 

With one hand still on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of dark water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on either side, and solid ice further downstream. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. I didn’t recognize him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from an expedition in South America. This chain is more special to me than having a famous grandfather, and only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that journey, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen. 

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom smiled as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his bedroom. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious from my wetsuit, and he had seen me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa can be difficult, and it’s been harder for me to ignore his temper lately. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His harsh words hit me hard for a moment. But I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came in with a sympathetic smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I held back from saying he had always been like this. Like my mom, I try to be understanding. When I was a child, he was my hero, especially when he showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang framed on his bedroom wall, along with his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. 

My mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even on these cold days!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Text: Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her into the study, where she saw an unframed painting on the table. It was clearly one of Grandpa's works, but it looked different and was obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" 

Jess looked closely at the painting. A river took up most of the scene; it was not a river she recognized, perhaps just a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a haunting way. The riverbank was barely visible, just a hint of green that drew the eye into the pale waters, leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, she felt captivated, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that showed her excitement, even though she tried to sound casual. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings; he just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt strangely significant to her, but she couldn't explain why. 

There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. But he hasn't finished it yet, so maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess; she knew what Grandpa would say. ""He told you it's not the artist's job to explain a painting because each one has its own life and language, just like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to every idiot..."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""...every ignoramus what it means. If artists had to explain their work to everyone, they would never get anything done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" 

""Inspire?"" Jess asked. ""Someone who motivates an artist."" She knew the meaning. Grandpa often used the word when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse wasn't helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a tough part to work on. He never suggested that the muse was related to her. In fact, she thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""

This morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I’m not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the moment, as things often do. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me quite often. 

What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and old-fashioned ladies. Now, I keep my collection of shells and fossils there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was excited when she gave it to me! 

The problem is, it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to fit in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is for Mum and Dad; the back one is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. When Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I’ll be stuck in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. Then I thought, if I can’t cut anything off the cabinet, why not cut a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that’s exactly what I was doing!"
47,"Text: 'The novel ‘The Borrowers’ tells the story of a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" items from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of this novel, I knew it would be challenging to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how it should be portrayed. I used the original illustrations from the book as a guide because I wanted to avoid criticism for getting it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans', which made filming more complicated.

A key aspect was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on their borrowing adventures, we had to position the camera ten times further away than usual. To capture the Borrowers' perspective, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from a height of no more than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. 

One major challenge was creating realistic shadows when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized surroundings. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, the famous US director George Lucas called to ask how we achieved it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, filled with oversized objects to make the actors appear small. It was wonderfully surreal. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really embraced the idea. The coins we used were larger than dinner plates and hard to lift, which often made the crew laugh, causing us to stop filming.

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to be pushed down a tunnel with hoses, and they found it so scary that they didn’t need to act. It was also important to me to get the costumes right, which has been a struggle for other directors. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they would stick out like dolls' clothes. This made it very difficult for the lead actress to move; she couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail with the costumes!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of each scene to show how they should look, and by the end, I had created 2,000 drawings. They weren’t perfect, but they were helpful. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly; I once filmed an entire scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But in the end, everything came together, and I believe the series successfully captured the magic of the books.'"
48,"Text: 'Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there aren’t any. I wonder how long it will take for the chaos to start. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life of touring and tutors. While the rest of the band is renting here for recording, we are staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet regular kids. How about a kid whose mom works in an office or a dad who mows lawns? That would be so cool. 

I walk into the school’s main office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the school secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary seems confused. “Oh,” she says and types “McGraw” on her keyboard. That’s one good thing; few people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One moment, it’s printing,” the secretary says. Then she rips the sheet and hands it to me. English Literature, first period. Great, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look foolish searching for my classes. 

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my very normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses in the attendance. “Desert... McGraw?” she says carefully. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she actually lets us socialize! All teachers should understand how important this is. 

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few options. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Essence? I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a recording studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, lies work better. “What does he do?” she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care much. Excellent.'"

Today, American teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents, have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is the reality for teenagers now. Both boys and girls cannot just attend school and remain unnoticed; being average is no longer enough. Mediocrity is seen as unacceptable, and lacking ambition is viewed as laziness. Teenager Kristen Loose points out that many adults forget the pressure teenagers face today. They deal with heavy homework loads, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to maintain a social life.

Despite these pressures being common, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, many believe it is unfair to label an entire generation this way. Loose argues that people often think teenagers spend most of their time glued to screens. She acknowledges that she keeps her cellphone close, but not for trivial reasons. For her, it is a tool that helps make life easier for herself and those around her. 

Today, students are expected to have constant access to information and be reachable at all times, which can create the impression of cellphone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might be listening to language lessons. Schoolwork and other responsibilities now demand attention around the clock, adding to the stress of already busy teenagers. Many start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish after midnight, balancing school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of American teenagers get enough sleep, and 28 percent admitted to falling asleep in school at least once a week due to lack of sleep.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen believes that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, this is not much. Olsen rarely spends this time on social media or watching TV; instead, she dedicates it to volunteer work. She feels that many people think teenagers are self-centered and only care about their own interests. However, Olsen says her favorite part of the week is volunteering. She enjoys helping others and looks forward to making a positive impact in her school and community.

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these views and contribute positively to the world. There will always be new generations of students making a difference before they even finish school."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This ongoing science project is both an astronomy experiment and an outdoor adventure, which is likely why teenagers join. I visited them one weekend in late spring. They were preparing to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a bright trail of light.

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box were a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check temperature changes during the ascent. Two GPS trackers were placed on the outside to help them find it later. A gas tank, donated by a supporter from a nearby state, was used to inflate the balloon, which slowly grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour round trip to get the gas tank. “I didn’t really mind,” he said. For kids in this club, that’s just part of the experience.

Finally, it was time for lift-off. “Five, four, three, two, one,” they counted down, and the balloon began to rise. Some of the teenagers ran to track its path with powerful flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder as the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at a sky so clear that it was hard to believe they were only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with around 4 million people. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” said one girl quietly. “I know,” whispered another. Suddenly, a meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, causing it to expand until it was almost the size of a house. Then it popped with a loud bang. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Retrieving it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. “Recoveries are a big part of the program,” said the group’s leader, noting they had lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.”

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students are familiar with the Eastern Sierra,” their leader explained. “What seems wild and dangerous to some is just a normal part of life for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not capture any shooting stars. While this was a bit disappointing, it provided a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they might behave above mountains. It was also another adventure story to share with anyone who asked."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she turned fifteen. Her interest began by chance when her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a phase many children go through. Although she initially dismissed his interest, she helped him with a science project and discovered an article about recent findings in Palaeontology that amazed her. She realized that this was a field she wanted to pursue.

I asked Chloe what support she received, as Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people at that time. She recalled meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite his youth. Chloe felt nervous at first, worried that he might see her as just an annoying kid. However, she felt more comfortable when he showed patience and listened to her questions.

I brought up how palaeontologists are portrayed in movies and TV shows. Chloe expressed her frustration, noting that films like Jurassic Park, which feature dinosaurs created with special effects, have increased public interest in dinosaurs but not necessarily in Palaeontology itself. She feels that palaeontologists are often shown as either eccentric geniuses or socially awkward individuals, which does not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explained that her job is very diverse. She spends time digging for dinosaur bones, working in laboratories to analyze fossils, and writing scientific papers. Although not always required, she also believes in the importance of communicating scientific findings to the public. She wants to help young people understand science better, as discussing dinosaurs can inspire their interest in the natural world and other scientific fields.

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She noted that the producers were knowledgeable, and her role was mainly to ensure accuracy, such as confirming that the dinosaurs depicted lived during the same time period. The documentary attracted viewers of all ages because it presented dinosaurs in a way that was much more realistic than in movies like Jurassic Park.

When I asked Chloe why dinosaurs continue to captivate us and remain a focus of research, she suggested that they appeal to our natural curiosity and desire for exploration. Dinosaurs remind us that there is still much to discover in our world, and Palaeontology offers a unique way to explore the past."
52,"Text: ""I want to make one thing clear: when you are traveling by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not 'there yet,' even if you keep asking, 'Are we there yet?' The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not 'there' anymore; it’s 'here.' So if you think you might be 'there' already, you should be asking, 'Are we here yet?' I’m sure no one wishes to be 'there yet' more than the parents who hear that question repeatedly on long car trips. 

Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You could watch DVDs you’ve never seen, listen to music, or do puzzles you’ve had for a long time, while enjoying the beautiful views outside. Meanwhile, your parent in the front seat, with a map, is there to hand out juice boxes and cookies, change the radio station, and keep everything running smoothly. 

But then, someone in the car does something annoying—usually my younger brother, Tim. For example, he might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he’s leaning over into my space, and a fight starts. The driver and the other parent have to reach back to separate us while the car swerves. They tell Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a bit, and we continue to see the amazing scenery.

Later, when I try to read, I feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing his breath in my direction. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. I get angry, and Tim gets yelled at again. The chaos settles down for now.

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask, 'Are we there yet?' he often replies, 'Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.' But we are still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour. Then he says, 'Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.' This keeps us quiet for a while. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults jump out of the car and move as far away from us as possible after all those hours. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, the answer is: no, you are not there yet."""
53,"Text: John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. The owners hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: “There is so much technology today. Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve screens. It’s natural for people to connect and communicate with each other.”

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged until the end, so no one feels left out. This idea was improved in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players work together to win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, designed by North American Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players must work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the famous book. He recalls, “When I played that with friends, we felt scared and excited. In the end, everyone felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to create something similar.”

Leacock’s love for board games started when he was a child. He says, “Games were my favorite birthday gift, but I often felt disappointed after playing them.” With help from his uncle, he would redesign games to make them better. Pandemic became a huge success, and its follow-up game advanced game design even further. Leacock explains, “It has a lot of storytelling. It’s like a video game where you develop characters, learn new rules, and the story changes as you play.”

Interestingly, the growth of the video game industry has helped the popularity of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games. Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company, says, “Everyone plays mobile games now. Most people with smartphones have at least one game they enjoy.”

For a while, video games allowed some social interaction, like playing together at arcades or on the couch. However, as multiplayer games moved online, players became physically distant from each other. This led some people to seek out ways to play games with others in person again. As seen in John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our increasingly online world, games are now something to be shared directly and physically, and this trend is likely to continue."

Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many false starts. He mentions that his mother was an ""amazing singer"" who encouraged him to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was a local one for middle-aged people, which influenced his musical taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a contemporary song. Around the same time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the music room at school learning songs on the piano. He said, ""With tennis, I was at a high level, but it was not what I wanted to do for my life. It was just too much hard work."" At 17, he left school to pursue a career as a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not share his passion for performing. Jamie recalls, ""I went to my parents and broke down. I told them this is what I wanted to do, that I had been writing lyrics in economics lessons and playing the piano every day while others were outside."" His father gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After several near misses with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 based on one song. However, record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend. Eventually, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not come easily. He said, ""In my artist career, I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time. But as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time."" Writing for other artists is where he truly found success. He believes he is one of the main writers that UK labels turn to for new artists. He helps launch their careers and sometimes has to explain that aiming for chart success is not something to be ashamed of. He asks artists, ""Why don’t you want to? Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?"" He emphasizes that they should aim to create something amazing that will also sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he simply knows he wants to write number one songs and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goals. He says, ""When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for global success and write the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool; we want to create classic modern pop songs."""

Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him if they don’t watch online videos of bike stunts. He is known as a ‘street trials cyclist.’ This means he jumps from difficult places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other challenging spots. These stunts are recorded and shared online.

On the day I interview him, we meet at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids all know who he is, and several older people come to greet him, calling him ‘an absolute legend.’ After watching him perform, I agree with them. I came with some doubts, but I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him after his performance, he seems uninterested and a bit down.

Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not enjoy being a celebrity. He finds the social side of fame difficult. He understands the importance of connecting with fans, but he prefers to focus on doing stunts rather than talking about them. This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that capture his stunts. He says, “This technology allows people like me to earn a living.” However, he feels that many people are too focused on recording themselves or looking at screens, and he does not fully agree with that.

Tony makes a good living from his videos, which is different from how it used to be for people in similar sports. After many years of interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two key factors help a child become a top competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These traits can be more important than talent and help a person keep going despite failures. In risky sports, it is especially important to have mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he considered easy but new challenges. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, “Those who criticize me may be worried, but they don’t understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t realize that I get advice from experts to reduce risks.” In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some never feel scared, and they shouldn’t be doing these sports. It’s important to recognize the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those who can overcome fear and those who cannot. I belong to the group that feels fear but finds a way to move past it. I am not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes, I ride around for a while to get in the right mindset before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm just before I jump. If I fully commit, then I am fine.”"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she used a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!” On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterward. “I’m glad it’s over!” Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."

He had previously written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.” Jeff wanted a unique touring bike and decided to build one himself. He thought a penny farthing would be the most interesting choice, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, which ended due to a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted choosing the penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more people were amazed by his bike. His toughest experience was having to drink dirty water from a stream, which caused him a serious fever. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to return home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the United States, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have recently started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’, which helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about the black duck population because their numbers have decreased significantly, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. While we have plenty of information about their activities during the day, we lack knowledge about their nighttime behavior due to the absence of proper equipment. This new scope will provide clear images, even on nights without a moon, allowing us to learn more and make informed decisions about protecting their habitat.

Our work is challenging. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in various locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites to record every duck I observe. The weather has been a factor; some nights are mild, but many are rainy. It is so quiet that I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. Despite the difficulties, I enjoy the challenge, especially when I think about the summer ahead, which will involve long hours in a laboratory analyzing our findings together. Being indoors will be tough, but it is necessary. I wouldn’t change this experience for anything!"

60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a center that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching objects like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can attend some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a career in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing repeatedly – it’s essential to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great aspect is the friendships formed with other performers and the opportunity to learn from them. Staying fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is crucial, but the best performers are those who are determined to succeed, have creativity, and continuously work on improving their skills. 

People often think that circus performers are likely to get injured or that they only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also includes business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, though, that it’s not a profession for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also competitive – but a lot of fun!”'"

People like Mariam are the true stars of the music industry! 

“What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just get on with the job!”

“Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. I will never forget my first experience recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough.”

Fortunately, I found a new career.’ Vicky began working for a charity called CycleZone. ‘We help young people who have never enjoyed sports,’ she says. ‘Our first step is to teach them how to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does important work, bringing young people together to form a community.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their efforts. Vicky comments, ‘Some people doubt that celebrity support is always beneficial for a charity. They argue that celebrities may be more interested in their own image, which can distract from the charity's real work. However, if famous singers and actors can help, I believe they should.’"
64,"Text: 'Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, music was always present in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, and she was so nervous that her teacher had to take her off the stage. This teacher suggested that she join the school theatre club to help her gain confidence. After participating in the club for some time, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Although she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many of the others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, which inspired her to write the song Something to Say about her frustration. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in it each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her that this would not happen, and soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a fantastic evening. Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments, as she feels she has more to express then. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her music, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her.'"
65,"Text: 'Last year, I went on an incredible trip – a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and wanted to write articles about the journey. He loves boats, which is not something I share. However, I had always dreamed of visiting this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes! 

A few days before our departure, there were storms in the area we were visiting. Fortunately, the weather forecast for our trip was calm seas. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry assured me he would handle everything, so I stopped worrying. 

After arriving in Canada, we met the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people live along that coast, and indeed, the only other creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. 

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was wonderful to forget about how fast or slow the day was going. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all prepared together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each night, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life! 

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew if I stayed, I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to share our adventures with everyone at home!'"
66,"Text: ""My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a child, I watched many of his games. You might think that this would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often brought a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training sessions, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I found myself in a game against another school. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy being away from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t too different for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""
67,"Text: ""Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was quite expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed giving tours. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from the perspective of tourists, and it felt like a new experience each time! After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I researched what was required, I learned that to get a license as a full-time tour guide, I needed to know much more than I had learned so far. All Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. 

Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. There are many other important skills. You need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and most importantly, you must be able to adapt to changing situations. For example, if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes, you need to handle it well. Tourists do not want to hear about problems or feel like they are missing out; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour. I must ensure that visitors are happy with my tours, as negative reviews online can harm my business. Like most tour guides, I understand that good reviews are very important because they attract more customers. That is why making tours enjoyable and stress-free is essential. I believe that the enthusiasm and energy I bring to my job lead to positive reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."""
68,"Text: ""My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I traveled to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Although she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were all older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first experience doing something like this. However, we ended up having a great time. 

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of our day. Josie found it challenging, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meals made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with large brushes and soap. I found this very enjoyable, even though I ended up wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they would spend the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we were prepared for that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff would spend the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often mention Thailand. However, if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I am not sure if she is being completely honest. I think she might feel a bit frustrated with herself for not fully enjoying her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she reflects on the experience, she realizes how fortunate she was to go. Maybe she will return one day – I definitely will!"""
69,"Text: ""My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not only to individuals for gifts or home decoration but also to various businesses. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and we sometimes provide flowers for photo shoots for companies' advertisements. Once, I even decorated a castle for a wedding, which was a lot of work, but I felt very proud of the result.

My day begins at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be quite cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, filled with flowers from around the world. The beautiful sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were buying for myself, I would probably choose only pink flowers, as that is my favorite color. However, I have to remember that my preferences may not match what my customers want. Not all flowers are available throughout the year, which can make it difficult to meet their requests.

I don’t enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it is part of my job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price I can. Once I return to the shop, we review customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then, we create flower arrangements and calculate the costs of the orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes need to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some might think this is too much effort, but I enjoy finding the best combinations of flowers for the budget someone has. That’s what selling is about, and I wouldn’t want to do anything else!"""
70,"Text: ""My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many children's movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized I wanted something more – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which created a great atmosphere for the film, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs without trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can track ticket sales online, so we no longer worry about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us how much they enjoyed the experience at the end, it feels wonderful. Our website has been very helpful, and we are now connected with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to see how they operate, but it is always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local reviews. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as word of mouth – people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film; last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I decided to start a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show others my work. I was surprised to find that many people appreciated my unique perspective.

I enjoyed photographing a variety of subjects, but then someone suggested that my project would be even better if all my photos had a common theme. I agreed and started focusing on nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they preferred color. This made me doubt my project at times, and I almost gave up. However, I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices.

One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She informed me about a national photography competition for my age group, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges announced that I had won first prize. I was incredibly happy because my project meant so much to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good enough for a professional career. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice of career."
72,"Text: ""I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities that help you grow and learn. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you complete each level, you receive a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to accept the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I found myself wanting to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I completed the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had formed good relationships with the children. Now, I spend about four hours a week there, and I always look forward to it. 

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that after I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job or youth work before starting at the club. This experience has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, including one for camping!"""
73,"Text: ""I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The slope looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved the sport and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I did well. After that first experience, I quickly grew to love snowboarding and improved my skills. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my passion for participating and winning has only grown stronger over the years, which motivates me to work harder. I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 in a local competition. I didn’t think I would attempt the jumps that earned me that score until I actually started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. 

In the summer, I focus on training and my studies when there is no snow. I train every day, but I enjoy not having to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends during this time. It helps me cope with not being able to do what I love and what I’m good at. I need to think about my future carefully. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I believe it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I am considering whether becoming a doctor is a possibility, depending on whether my active lifestyle allows me to study for a college degree. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."""

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try that. I never thought I would find it so easy, as it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to be sure they were good enough for other people. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my items to take home. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but we were just two people at a market stall! That was when I realized it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far."""
75,"Text: 'When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, “Because of my father’s job, my family moved around a lot, so I learned how to make new friends. I know what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, adjusts to a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.” 

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to spend her time this way. The year before, she had entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. This is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was available in bookstores. 

One review of Being Amelia notes that, despite the cheerful pictures of teenagers on the cover, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer mentions that even though Janine is still very young and her novel isn’t very long, she has shown that she is a better writer than many bestselling authors. Janine is still adjusting to her fame: “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!”'"
76,"Text: ""My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for an organization that cares for historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was excited about this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should accept the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home across the water, and there was no school nearby. However, once we moved, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle is not particularly beautiful, but our apartment there is comfortable. 

In the summer, the island feels very lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, but there are not as many teenagers as I had hoped. The adults support each other and help with repairs, which often requires a lot of hard work. 

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to the stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I will miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my schoolmates visit, I always tell them to hurry! 

Despite these challenges, we often enjoy amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but within hours, it can be bright and sunny again. This still feels incredible, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do experience terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to withstand them. But then I remind myself that it has been here for centuries and is still standing!"""
77,"I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best spots to see them. It was incredible, and after returning home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am close to achieving that. During family holidays abroad, I have had the chance to see birds from other countries as well. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we traveled to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I have learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it interesting and commented positively. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year! I am fortunate to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not consider becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually many birds to see, especially in areas with lots of greenery. I also believe that birdwatching clubs should work to attract more young people to this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, regardless of their age, and it doesn’t have to be expensive."

However, my family knew that I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought I would do the same with football. But that never happened. In fact, I started dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one of the referees saw that I was a talented player, so he asked the manager of a professional women's club to watch me. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised at first – I didn’t know that young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I began regular training with a big club when I was just 13. After that, I improved a lot. Still, some people doubted I would ever become a star player, which made me a bit sad. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and to believe in my abilities – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let the other players down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with the large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my teammates carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to give them a chance to meet other players from my club. It will show them the professional environment and inspire them to believe they could play for a top team if they are willing to work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times, but also some challenges. I’ve had very few challenges, though – so I consider myself lucky!"""

In recent years, there has been an interesting trend in further and higher education in the UK and around the world. This trend encourages new students to get involved in research as early as possible in their studies. It acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries. Instead, research is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. 

Research skills are valuable not only for your studies but also for your future job. They help you think critically about the world and how to approach your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just memorize and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions rather than accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we encounter? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes in knowledge. However, research can also start from simple inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about various issues, practices, and events. Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done research for school projects or answered questions at work since you began your education. You have asked questions that led you to investigate topics, whether it was planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training a pet, or finding the right products online.

In college and higher education, it is expected that you will have a curious mind, identify problems and questions, critically evaluate information, and create your own responses and knowledge. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning often involves listening to teachers and texts without questioning them. It may feel disrespectful to challenge established knowledge or authority, and you might think you should be told what is important to learn. However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.

This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students, academics, and professionals, but we must not simply repeat what we read as if it is always true. We need to engage with the information, think critically about it, test it, and determine if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should avoid blindly accepting facts and information from our readings or conversations."
80,"Text: 'Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity, from the coffee houses of 18th-century London, where people discussed science and politics, to the cafés of modern Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso talked about art. However, living in a city is not easy. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera; Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While modern cities can be creative places, they can also feel unnatural and overwhelming. 

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. It has long been known that city life is tiring, but new research shows that living in cities can actually reduce our ability to think clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in urban environments. Studies have shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can improve brain function because they provide a break from the stress of city life.

This research comes at a significant time: for the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into concrete environments, surrounded by many strangers. It has become clear that these unnatural surroundings can greatly affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. 

Think about everything your brain has to manage while walking down a busy street: distracted people, dangerous crossings that require attention to traffic, and the confusing layout of the city. These seemingly simple tasks can drain our energy because they force our brains to constantly shift focus. A city is filled with so many stimuli that we must continually decide what to pay attention to. This process of managing our focus takes a lot of mental energy. In contrast, natural environments do not require as much cognitive effort. 

This idea is known as attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. It has been recognized that human attention is limited – focusing in the morning makes it harder to concentrate in the afternoon. Kaplan suggested that being in nature could help restore our attention. Natural settings have elements that naturally attract our focus but do not cause negative feelings, unlike loud noises like police sirens. This allows our mental focus to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban areas. Urban parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a much-needed escape from city life. A well-designed park can enhance brain function in just a few minutes. While people have tried many methods to boost cognitive performance, such as energy drinks or redesigning office spaces, it seems that simply taking a walk in nature is one of the most effective solutions.

Given the many mental challenges caused by city life, one might wonder: Why do cities keep growing? And why do they remain important centers of intellectual activity, even in the digital age? Recent research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that can lead to attention and memory problems – like crowded streets and close proximity to others – are also linked to innovation. Scientists believe that the ‘concentration of social interactions’ is a key factor in urban creativity. Just as the crowded environment of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy atmosphere of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, supports its role as a hub for technology and creativity. 

The challenge, then, is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its unique advantages. Because there will always be moments when someone feels, as the song says, ‘I’m tired of the trees, take me to the city!’'"

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe there is no strong reason to limit the study of the mind to just the brain or the body. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as our brain cells, play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that items like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have actively contributed to human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, I propose that what exists outside our heads may also be part of our minds. It is understandable that the mind and the brain are often seen as the same because most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their surroundings. This is practical for neuroscientists, especially when using brain-scanning machines. However, this often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. 

I do not want to deny the importance of the brain in thinking, but I want to emphasize that the mind is more than just the brain. It is more useful to consider the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects can become extensions of our thinking or be integrated into our actions, like when we create numbers from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also looks at how these interactions have changed since ancient times and what these changes mean for our thinking.

This approach provides new insights into what minds are and what they consist of by examining how objects assist our thinking. For example, think of a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick helps us understand that minds and objects can be seen as connected. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: by using the stick, the blind person transforms touch into a form of sight, and the stick itself plays an important role. The sensation felt through the stick is projected onto the environment, making the brain treat the stick as part of the body.

The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can adapt and change significantly by incorporating new technologies. I view the human mind as an ongoing project that is always evolving. It is important to remember that, regardless of what form the ‘stick’ has taken throughout our history—whether it is a simple stone tool or a modern smartphone—its main purpose is to connect us to the world rather than to limit us. 

Through the ‘stick’, humans explore, learn, and understand their environment, while also finding new paths forward. This is different from how monkeys use sticks to get food. For humans, ‘sticks’ are tools for satisfying our curiosity. This unique human ability to engage with material culture explains why we create things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as we interact with the material world. I want to emphasize the importance of material objects in understanding cognition. MET provides a new perspective on how various forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern devices, have influenced who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, it is important to realize that humans have been using such technology since our early evolution."
82,"Text: ""Few inventions have changed civilization as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of culture at all levels – practical, scientific, industrial, and aesthetic, as well as in entertainment. Historians argue that photography is the country’s greatest contribution to the visual arts. No other art form has had such a significant impact from the US. This claim reflects the idea that photography is central to US intellectual and aesthetic discussions, and to understand its impact, we must look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was this new art form so appealing? First, photography was a mechanical process that matched a growing interest in technology, part of a national mindset that accepted change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into homes in an immediate way. Second, the camera became the preferred tool for representing the self, allowing individuals to create public images in a society where identities were constantly being formed and reformed. Third, the camera has been important for creating and preserving family memories, even if those memories are somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs aligned with a trend towards realism in US art, focusing on everyday life.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. The fact that photographs are made by a machine gives them a unique quality: they are records of events, people, and things, representing what was in front of the camera and embodying a certain objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by an individual, it also carries a personal point of view. We might look at a photograph and think we understand its meaning, leading to the idea that photography is a ‘universal language.’ Yet, the meaning of a photograph is more complex. Few subjects convey their own meaning, and no image is presented without some context that shapes our understanding, such as a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery.

To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and function within its cultural context: Why did the photographer take the image? How was it first seen? Additionally, the same image can be viewed in different contexts, leading to different meanings. While the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized for a long time, it is now clear. In recent decades, starting with artist Andy Warhol’s use of photographs in his work, artists have been incorporating photography in various ways. In summary, photographic vision has become an essential part of painting and our understanding of representation before the invention of the camera."""
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, which gives us some understanding of what this means. Although we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains a complex concept. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way of knowing about these elements. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not align with scientific facts.

This personal understanding can lead us to make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We often act as amateur psychologists when we share opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing is effective or why people behave in certain ways. Problems can arise when two people interpret situations differently. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in specific situations. Psychologists help us differentiate between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

While psychology studies the mind and brain, psychologists do not yet fully understand how the brain works in relation to our emotions and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not directly observable like a machine's. Instead, we can only infer mental processes from behavior.

Studying psychology is similar to solving a crossword puzzle; it requires evaluating and interpreting clues. These clues must come from careful observation and accurate measurement, analyzed rigorously and interpreted logically. Psychology often involves complex interactions, and understanding these requires advanced techniques and theories. Like any science, psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. Achieving these goals can help us understand our experiences and apply findings to improve people's lives.

Psychological research has been beneficial in various areas, such as improving reading methods for children, designing safer machine controls, and helping emotionally distressed individuals communicate their feelings. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation has only occurred in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to answer psychological questions, focusing on identifying mental structures. While this remains important, introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only reveals a small part of the brain's automatic functions. William James compared introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than solely on personal reflection."
84,"In a storehouse located in a typical business park in Michigan, USA, there exists a unique collection known as the Museum of Failed Products. This collection, owned by a company called GfK, includes items that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product represents a story of disappointment for the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. 

What is most surprising about this museum is that it operates as a successful business. You might think that any serious manufacturer would keep a collection of their failed products, but many executives who visit the museum show that this is not common. They often avoid thinking about their failures and do not keep samples of their unsuccessful products. The museum itself was created by Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, who originally wanted to build a reference library of consumer products, not specifically failed ones. Starting in the 1960s, he began collecting samples of every new product he could find. He did not realize that most products fail, which led to his collection being mostly made up of unsuccessful items.

Today’s optimistic culture likely contributes to the products displayed in the museum. Each product probably went through many meetings where no one recognized its potential failure. Even if they did, marketers might feel pressured to invest more money into a failing product to save face. Little effort is usually made to understand why these products failed, and those involved often choose not to discuss it again.

This tendency to focus on positivity is especially strong in the self-help industry, where a common belief is that visualizing success can lead to better outcomes. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot has found evidence that our minds may be naturally inclined to see positive outcomes as more likely than they actually are. Her research suggests that well-adjusted individuals often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events compared to those who are depressed.

However, how effective are these positive thoughts about the future? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have researched this question. Their findings are surprising: spending time imagining successful outcomes can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For instance, groups of people who were encouraged to visualize a successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our experiences with failure are shaped by our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think that ability can develop through effort and challenges. Those with a fixed mindset often find failure very distressing, seeing it as proof that they are not as capable as they thought. For example, a talented athlete might believe they are naturally gifted but fail to practice enough to reach their potential. In contrast, people with a growth mindset view failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being challenged. Ultimately, having a growth mindset is a more positive way to approach life, regardless of whether it leads to success."
85,"Text: 'It is well-known that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is this the case? Many people think they understand it, but professional sports are changing rapidly, and what we once accepted as true is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the traditional view of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists are investigating what helps players perform at their best, leading to various theories about home advantage. At the same time, those in charge of finances want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are well-paid, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

This raises questions for fans. For example, would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. This belief may lead them to confuse cause and effect. When a team advances, home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal, creating a loud celebration. Fans often remember the cheering before a goal but forget the many times when the cheering did not lead to success.

However, there is one common belief among fans that scientific evidence supports. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct their energy towards the referee. In a well-known study, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another version without sound. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team compared to those who watched in silence. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. This suggests that referees try to avoid extra stress from the crowd's reactions.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change could be travel; in the past, travel was difficult, but now players travel in great comfort. Stadiums have also become more similar, losing their unique characteristics. Despite these changes, none of the explanations fully account for the data.

The mystery remains as to why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball shows the greatest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual matchups. Team sports require coordination among players, and in basketball, success depends on teamwork, which is strengthened by the familiarity of playing at home.

Another possibility relates to a more primal aspect of sports. Research indicates that players’ testosterone levels are normal before training and away games but can be 67% higher before home games. This increase may be linked to a natural instinct to protect their home ground, as seen in recent Rugby World Cup matches. In two notable games, underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing determination and aggression—characteristics of home advantage. As one referee put it, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’"""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying has become famous among dedicated athletes and their coaches. The reason for its popularity is clear. First, there is debate about who originally said it, with many other golfers from that time being suggested. Second, the meaning is not straightforward. Player was not talking about luck in a literal sense; he was being ironic. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ However, there is a limit to this improvement, and the question of where that limit is relates to the nature versus nurture debate – whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice.

It would be misleading to call this a balanced debate; it is more like a basketball game where one side is clearly winning. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent has gained support from psychologist Anders Ericsson, who proposed that anyone can achieve expertise in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. This idea has been popularized in books like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers and others with titles like Talent Is Overrated. These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor, suggesting that ‘10,000 hours is both necessary and sufficient to make anyone an expert in anything.’

However, as Epstein discusses in his engaging book, this idea is often too simplistic. He points out a major flaw in much research on excellence: it usually focuses only on successful individuals. He asks if there are better ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate innate talent from environmental factors, support, opportunity, and determination. Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden and beyond, to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the success of sled dogs in tough races may depend on their drive and desire, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary.

This raises the question: can commitment and determination be chosen, or are they influenced by genetics? Epstein highlights the complexity of this issue. He distinguishes between ‘hardware’ (nature) and ‘software’ (nurture), agreeing that both are essential for elite athletes. He does not deny the importance of training or environment, suggesting that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, he also examines cases where genetics play a significant role that cannot be overlooked. He addresses the important topics of race and gender, asking: ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""
87,"Text: A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main issue. This idea connects with other discussions about childhood today. A follow-up study interviewed children to understand their feelings better. It found that many children do not wish for the latest technology; instead, they would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults over 40 often talk fondly about their own childhoods, recalling how they spent long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They believe this was much better and healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they created this protective environment for their own kids, avoiding risks like building forts in old sheds. 

Griffiths’ book contains strong arguments. She discusses the fear parents have about dangers in the outside world and how this fear supports the toy and gadget industry, which sells entertainment to keep children occupied at home. She also criticizes trends like prescribing medication for restless children or requiring kids to wear goggles during traditional playground games. While I am unsure how common these strict rules are, Griffiths expresses her frustration with passion. She also inspires readers with her thoughts on childhood freedoms and limitations, from fairy tales to school rules. 

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas, ignoring important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares the modern treatment of children to a subtle form of racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths has a romantic view of children. Although she acknowledges that children can be mischievous, she mostly presents an idealized view of them that may not match reality. She argues that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks, believing they need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Additionally, not all children may want the adventurous lifestyle Griffiths admires. What about those who are naturally shy or prefer to stay at home? Perhaps the real issue is that society often forces all children into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too far outside their comfort zones."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and personal life, but this skill is not just about what I learned in school. Many life problems cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from real-life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those that have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is more difficult to learn than grazing. Primates, including humans, play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instinct. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they have the chance. 

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to educate themselves. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating effectively, and controlling their impulses and emotions. Creativity is essential for success in today’s economy. We no longer need people who simply follow instructions or perform routine calculations. Instead, we need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will build a strong workforce.

However, we cannot teach creativity directly; it can be stifled by a school system that focuses on fixed questions and answers. More importantly, children need to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they develop social skills and learn about fairness and morality, which are essential for their future.

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop at any time. If they cannot quit, it is not truly play. Players understand that to keep the game enjoyable, they must consider the happiness of others. This freedom makes play a very democratic activity. 

Unfortunately, school has become more demanding, with fewer breaks, more homework, and greater pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games, and adult-supervised playdates have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play. Adults often feel they must intervene rather than allow children to solve their own problems. 

These changes have happened slowly but have had a significant impact. They are caused by various social factors, including parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to follow their natural instincts to play and explore, so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is a modern way to get noticed compared to the old method of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher risk of making mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many influential contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. However, the executive was offended by the idea of sharing her contacts with a stranger who had not earned that opportunity. She rejected his request and sent a sarcastic message that quickly spread online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret her tone, if not her message. Yet, if this incident encourages young people to think more carefully about their professional use of social media, it could ultimately benefit them. 

This situation highlights a serious issue: social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Unfortunately, many are making mistakes. Ironically, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of young people for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress others and create a different identity. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. With the right pictures and songs on your Facebook page, you could seem like a more interesting person overnight. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different, and some young people do not see this difference. We learned to be bold and confident online, which might explain why some still think this is the right approach. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you are a good candidate. We need to understand that what we learned as teenagers does not apply anymore, and we must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too casual and come off as arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of our generation as entitled. In reality, many of us are struggling to find jobs, which is why we are using social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt the job prospects of young people who, despite their mistakes, have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, such as doing research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of receiving a helpful response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to prevent leaving a negative impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it requires careful use to avoid being ignored."
90,"Text: ""Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by one-third to one-half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of Americans, down from 45% in 2001. Many people confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will be gone within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were finished and that the daily newspaper would become the most important source of news. Yet, theatre survived not only the newspaper but also cinema and television. Radio has thrived in the age of TV, and cinema has continued to do well against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once considered new media, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This was not only because producing timely news for a large audience became possible in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railways, and telegraphs, but also because people began to understand that everything around them was constantly changing and needed regular updates. In medieval times, people did not think this way; they only recognized the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life, as writer Alain de Botton describes, was 'inevitably cyclical' and 'the most important truths were recurring.' Before the 19th century, journalism as a profession was not well established, and there was no clear need for people to receive news regularly. In some ways, the regular publication of newspapers and their fixed format can be limiting. Online news allows readers to choose when and how they want to engage with the news based on their interests. Advanced search engines and algorithms help us personalize the news. When significant events happen, online news sources can provide updates almost instantly. There are no space limits that restrict storytelling or analysis, and readers can often access full documents or events mentioned in news articles. This is very different from the limitations of newspaper publishing. However, many news providers do not seem to recognize the potential of the internet to enhance understanding. Instead, they focus on being the first to report news, increasing reader comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In medieval times, news was often shared in busy marketplaces or taverns, where truth competed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be returning to that environment. Newspapers have not always been effective at explaining how the world works. They may be facing extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a 'chaotic universe,' newspapers will find a way to help us gain wisdom and understanding."""
91,"Text: ""If humans truly belonged under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many night creatures do. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genetics, even if we don’t often think of ourselves as daytime beings, just like we don’t think of ourselves as primates or mammals. Yet, this is the only way to understand what we have done to the night. We have changed the night to suit us by filling it with light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits, there are also consequences, known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 

Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it downwards, where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and rhythms that many life forms, including us, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects various life aspects, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and there were no public gaslights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. 

We have illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. Among mammals, the number of night-active species is impressive. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. The effect is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by searchlights or gas flares, circling endlessly until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours because of artificial light.

It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Unlike astronomers, most of us may not need a perfect view of the night sky for our work, but we, like many other creatures, do need darkness. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is as crucial for our biological health as light is; changing our internal clock can lead to various health issues. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping in our lives reflects the natural light changes on Earth. These rhythms are so essential to our existence that disrupting them is like changing our center of gravity.

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. Living in our own created glare, we have disconnected ourselves from our evolutionary and cultural roots – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. In a real way, light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, losing sight of our scale, which is best understood against the backdrop of a deep night with the Milky Way – the edge of our galaxy – shining above us."""
92,"Text: 

The founder of a large multinational company recently announced that his business will no longer track employees' paid holiday time. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. However, this way of announcing the change feels like a superficial attempt to make the policy seem more friendly, even though it might not be very generous.

Is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services, including finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn't hurt the business"" seems more suitable for a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads better. In a large company, it is hard to know if taking time off will affect the business or their careers.

The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel completely sure that their team is up to date on all projects and that their absence will not harm the business. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works; you pause your work, but it keeps piling up. Employees who follow these guidelines might not take any leave at all or feel guilty about taking time off. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers do not take enough leave, it could reduce productivity over time.

Additionally, there may be pressure from colleagues and gossip about who is off work and for how long. This pressure can already influence when people start and finish their workday. In many companies, especially in the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If the security and rights that come with statutory leave are removed, workers may feel they cannot take the time off they need for fear of being seen as lazy. They would lose their legal right to rely on.

This policy might create a situation where employees feel unable to take their entitled leave, or they might continue to use their statutory rights as a guideline, making the new policy ineffective. Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which has blurred the line between work and personal time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees questioned how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the employer cannot track employees' working hours accurately, why should they apply a different standard for time off?

However, a potential problem with having no set working hours is that all hours could become working hours. Employees may never know if their working hours are being monitored, leading them to feel constantly watched and self-disciplined, which can be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid annual leave because rest and leisure are essential for their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can exist without considering worker well-being. Therefore, I am skeptical that allowing employees to ""take as much holiday as they want"" is truly the intention or likely outcome of this policy."
93,"Text: 

Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a specific field evaluate a scientific research paper. It is often seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. This process is believed to filter out flawed or nonsensical papers, and scientists often mention it positively when speaking to the media or the public. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to maintain trust in published research? The answer is both yes and no. Examining these issues reveals much about the current state of scientific publishing, which is changing.

I am not ready to completely abandon journal-based peer review. I still believe that all papers should go through some form of checking before they are published. However, I sense a shift happening. The increasing use of preprints—drafts of papers shared online without peer review—plays a significant role in this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new findings so that others can read, critique, and build upon them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which has affected both authors' motivations and reviewers' roles. The competition for publication in prestigious journals encourages scientists to produce high-quality work, and these journals do publish excellent research. However, the strong rewards for publishing in top journals can lead to shortcuts, as studies that omit inconvenient data are more likely to be accepted. Reviewers now often focus on whether a manuscript is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For leading journals, this can depend more on relevance or newsworthiness than on scientific merit.

These issues are well-known, but few are willing to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints might offer a solution without drastically changing the norm. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they have not been widely adopted. This slow acceptance reflects scientists' conservative nature and the common belief that journals will not accept manuscripts that have been posted as preprints. There is also concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to the spread of poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.

While preprints are not peer-reviewed, authors understand that they are open to critique and discussion from a global community of reviewers. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shares her experience: “My paper critiqued a published study, which traditional journals do not handle well. In their anonymous peer review system, the original authors might block a critical paper, or if they are not chosen as reviewers, they might complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their feedback. All comments are public, allowing readers to assess the quality of the arguments. The risk of rejection by journals is less concerning since we still have the preprint and public comments, ensuring our work is not wasted.”

Preprint archives facilitate informal scientific discussions that were once limited to private correspondence. They can also serve as a valuable platform for sharing negative results, which are often overlooked by journals focused on new discoveries. Additionally, being on preprint archives significantly increases the visibility and citation of papers, demonstrating the effectiveness of sharing research this way. By embracing the web's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the research itself, rather than where it is published."

When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say it is ""a painting in words."" However, these answers usually do not satisfy either me or them. One day, I asked a group of students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it: one as a scientist would, describing it objectively, and another from the object's perspective, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I am a device that helps people breathe. I am only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The object? An oxygen mask – an unusual choice that helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and meaningful discussion.

When I was in school, I found poetry confusing. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand and feel. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes, you come across a poem, and it stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we hope to find in poems? Aren’t they places for deep feelings, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp humor? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp criticism, we read online articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music – what can compare to that perfect mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody? 

However, one useful aspect of poetry is its ambiguity. Everyday life is full of uncertainty, unlike reading sentences one after another. But these thoughts still don’t explain what a poem truly is. If you search for ""poem"" in an online encyclopedia, it redirects you to ""poetry,"" defined as ""a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language."" This is fine for an English professor, but it overlooks the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who ""makes things."" So, if a poem is a created thing, what kind of thing is it?

Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untamed and unpredictable – or to machines – carefully designed and precise – depending on their perspective. But these comparisons often break down upon closer examination. The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it generates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both. It can help us rethink our usual ways of thinking and see ordinary things in a new way.

The idea of a poem as a mental object is not hard to grasp, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The combination of words and melody has a strong impact, similar to schoolyard rhymes like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, right in front of you: A poem can resonate deeply like nothing else, even though, on paper, it does the same as the prose around it. 

What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten just like an article, story, or novel, but it does not usually become a product for sale. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make back their printing costs. A poem stands out not as a product for the market, but as something valuable in itself. Because of its unique status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."

I bought my first metal detector shortly after getting married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and I could have used it for something practical for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered brought me joy. I have always enjoyed feeling connected to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a nearby spot known for old farming machinery. When my detector first beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t walk away without checking. I dug down half a meter and lay in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. Having found brass curtain rails before, I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, beautifully patterned loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before—the Great Torc, displayed in the British Museum. It is the most famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I was holding.

I took it to my car, and at every stoplight on the way home, I looked at the torc on the passenger seat. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the only cleaning it had received since ancient times. “Marion!” I called out, “I have something for you.” As I admired my find, I heard my wife enter the room and stop. “What is it?” she asked after a moment. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were worried about damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. Although we had never been robbed, I felt anxious and restless. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath.

The law requires that such finds be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I brought it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone with his back to me. When he turned around, he stopped mid-sentence. The torc was verified and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. However, the torc has meant much more to me than just a lucky find. I feel I have saved it for the nation. People often say to me, “Now that you’ve made such a great discovery, will you stop detecting?” But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing—there’s always the chance of catching an even bigger one tomorrow."
96,"Text: ""Sleeping is one of my greatest joys when I travel, but I don’t often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in beautiful Italian beds? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours—over 12—I spent sleeping each day. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could enjoy a deeper, more dream-filled sleep than I ever expected. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. However, I believe that the quality of sleep while traveling is not just about relaxing. I think sleep is actually part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we expose ourselves to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. We take in a lot of new things—cultures, music, landscapes, and even different ways of moving. It is during sleep that we process this flood of new experiences. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are traveling. Sleep also changes in rhythm from place to place. People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For instance, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up at dawn to start their day before it gets too hot, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is high, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to adjust to the island’s different sleep and wake patterns. When I finally adapt to the local sleep schedule, I feel like I have truly arrived. I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a large lunch with new Dominican friends in a big apartment overlooking the blue Caribbean Sea. After the heavy meal and heat, our conversation faded and eventually stopped. One by one, my friends left the table to lie down on nearby hammocks and sofas. I suddenly understood why my hosts had so many pillows on the floor. I took a couple for myself and followed their lead. I had always heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I truly experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life. Travel sleep has another wonderful quality: it is memorable. Away from my usual sleep routine, I find joy in the new scents, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep in a new place. If a commitment to ‘slow travel’—enjoying every moment instead of rushing to do everything—is what defines the modern traveler, then what could be slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my habits and be honest with my ambitious friends, explaining that travel sleep is, after all, an important part of the experience."""
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. “What do you think? Be honest.” Mia picked up a medium-sized hat, soft with a layer of gauze and decorated with a silk bow. “I still think this one suits you best,” she said diplomatically. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that looked unfortunate. “But it’s so boring,” she replied. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out.” She patted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” 

Mia knew she had lost this argument. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at her daughter’s wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. Today was Jen’s thirtieth birthday, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since they had all been together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie, whom they knew nothing about. Her husband, Jeff, had quickly pointed this out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. “Tattie?” Jeff had said. “What kind of name is that?” “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “More like something very pretentious,” Jeff responded. He did not like pretentiousness or anything showy. He also did not believe in “pussyfooting around,” as he called Mia’s hesitation to speak her mind. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and probably would have said that a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The trouble with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite for your own good.”

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door; her commute took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff had been doubtful. “Do you really think there’s a demand for hats?” he asked. Mia knew from her friends that finding the perfect hat for special occasions was difficult, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women traveled from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where she provided a relaxed environment for them to try on as many hats as they needed. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she had expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry as well."

It is a long journey from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident but seems surprised by how far he has come, from competing in an Olympic final in discus to possibly starting a new career. Although he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still figuring out the responsibilities of his new position.

The idea that a 21-year-old beginner from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports is surprising. However, Lawrence is known for proving doubters wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on training for discus after previously playing rugby. Within 20 months of starting, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower.

Lawrence originally came to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in American football, he confirms, “Yes, it was in the back of my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school in London, but it seemed unrealistic then. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played the game, he felt confident enough to apply for the trials. 

When asked if he was nervous about competing against experienced players, he replied, “No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.” Although he is not very talkative, he is sure of his abilities. His performance in various tests made him stand out as the most impressive player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he said, showing a rare moment of pride.

However, he is also cautious. He lacks basic experience, so how can he make it onto an NFL team? “Coaches have told me I have the right qualities. It’s all about how hard I work,” he said. Will he be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will definitely be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness may come from his disappointing Olympic final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that experience and is proud that he qualified for the final with an impressive last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he said. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. It’s something I can return to.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some speculated that he let the experience affect him. Lawrence chooses not to comment on that. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, which is a strong financial incentive. So, Lawrence has moved from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Given his many talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replied. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can always return to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"Text: 'We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to find it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, autumn had not yet arrived in Siberia. I saw no signs of human life, just a strange mix of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled sleepily at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow, traveling to the remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I managed to tell him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. “But, Robert,” he argued, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it anymore. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to convince him with hand gestures that I had plenty of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget for my trip. Most of my clothes and gear were bought at low prices. In reality, I wasn’t sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers that I had bought for £10. 

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. “OK,” it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I still struggled to control my classes fully, the job met many important needs for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and often fulfilling, plus there were long holidays to pursue adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since that first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger and bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was certainly his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, proving he could handle each new challenge, even when it seemed impossible. He was showing the skeptics who said he couldn’t do it that they were wrong. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive.'"
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots compete by flying through a series of pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They perform sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate. An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was healthy, and the second stated that I would empty my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay oriented throughout the experience. “The horizon is your best friend,” I was told, and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I was also asked to promise that when flying upside down, I would “completely relax and try to enjoy the view.”

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was instructed not to touch anything. As we began taxiing down the runway, I was nervous. My legs were up, my feet avoided the important steering pedals, and my hands stayed away from the many switches nearby. Despite the instructions, I found it hard to relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying: to survive without fainting, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right moments. Panicking is not an option.

As we accelerated down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and just two seconds later, we made a sharp right turn. It was a sudden, intense movement, and I felt the air rush out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a brief moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out, turned sharply left, and dove down, leaving my stomach behind at 2,000 meters.

Seconds later, we were just 10 meters off the ground, heading for a small gap between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, but my moment of excitement was interrupted by another sharp turn. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand shook so much that the plane shook too. Then Dario spoke, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he performed a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yup.” “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. 

I know many people would find this thrilling, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was overwhelming. At the top of the loop, while upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields below. The flight lasted 10 minutes and felt “soft” compared to what the pilots experience during races. To illustrate this, Dario pulled out sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about the loop over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan is a filmmaker who captures wild animals in cold environments. If you have ever been impressed by videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He believes that his ideal temperature is -18°C. Allan studied marine biology and worked as a commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold conditions. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up guiding the crew to various locations, and after 48 hours, I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, and underwater experiences,"" he explains. He is now a leading cameraman and has contributed to many important wildlife TV series.

""I started at a good time. When I began, very few people had been to Antarctica. There were experts for coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became known as the cold expert. It felt like there were incredible scenes just waiting to be filmed."" When he started 35 years ago, the camera and communication technology were very basic. ""Filming is definitely easier now. Back then, if you recorded something, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and review it immediately. You had to plan your shots carefully, and film was very costly. Now, it’s easy to end up with too much footage.""

""My strength is my experience in cold environments. I feel comfortable there. I have spent so much time on sea ice that it feels as easy as crossing the street. I do get cold toes, but the polar regions are healthy places. There are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes."" Allan notes that wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and awkward moments. Once, while in the Orkneys filming kittiwakes, he could not identify the birds.

Recently, Allan received permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would be a challenging task. This area is home to polar bears and is only accessible to the bravest or most reckless. In April, temperatures are usually around -32°C, the winds are harsh, and carrying cameras through deep snow is very difficult. After walking for five or more hours each day and observing polar bear dens for 23 days, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on the 24th day, he felt as if he was in the bears' world, moving at their pace and sensing their presence. 

""We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch, and run to keep warm. After five hours of watching, suddenly I catch a quick glimpse that I almost miss. But the camera is focused on the hole, and my eye is quickly on the viewfinder. After a few seconds, I see an unmistakable black nose. The nose becomes a muzzle, then a full head, and in less than a minute, she emerges from the hole, resting on the snow. She looks at me but seems unbothered. Just as I think it can't get any better, she slides down the slope, and I believe she is enjoying herself,"" he recalls, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ""Clearly, it’s their first look at the world. It’s showtime on the slopes, and we have front-row seats.""

Now, Allan wants to create his own film about climate change in the Arctic, speaking with the local people who experience its effects firsthand. He believes he could make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk alone to the North Pole without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole as well. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined individuals, which is essential for their work. This time, however, the stakes are much higher. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre trek to the North Pole, where they will take detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and Pen understands that the results will be crucial for scientists. This expedition will provide a clearer understanding of how global warming is affecting the polar ice.

Pen was prepared for this kind of work from a young age. He was raised by his father's old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She toughened him up by sending him out into harsh weather with minimal clothing. His father also inspired his love for adventure in cold places, and Pen developed remarkable physical endurance. He is married to Mary, a horsewoman who shares his passion for the outdoors. Mary helps run his polar guide business and often worries about him more when he is at home, saying, ""He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic."" For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event, finishing an hour ahead of him. 

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He admits that it is much harder to be away from them this time. When he last went on an expedition, his children were one and five years old. He made a mistake in how he said goodbye, telling his son to take care of his mother and sister. His son took this seriously and constantly checked on them, which became too much for him. Although Pen meant well, he feels it was unfair. For this trip, he plans to have very little contact with his family while in the Arctic, as he believes that calling them would remind them of how far away he is.

In the days leading up to his departure, Pen is meticulously preparing his equipment. He knows that once he is on the ice, it will be very difficult to fix anything or do anything complicated. He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support crew of six who will fly in supplies. Pen finds being part of a team more stressful, and he is also concerned about his upcoming 47th birthday. He feels he has not trained as much as he would like, as organizational tasks have taken priority. He is worried about what he will demand of himself during the expedition.

Pen believes that his mission connects exploration with the pursuit of knowledge that motivated earlier explorers. He admits that reaching the North Pole was mainly a personal goal and had limited value beyond the polar adventure community. This time, however, scientists will benefit from the data collected, and they aim to engage as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He emphasizes that this is important work, and they are uniquely qualified to do it. ""Our skills, which may seem strange and unnecessary in everyday life, have become extremely relevant. Suddenly, we are socially useful again,"" he says."
103,"Text: ""I took a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Although I enjoyed these activities, I felt there was nothing competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape so I could compete for an Olympic spot if that dream came back to me. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle’s invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very interested. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to enter the race anyway and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We believed we had a better chance than most, but it would still require effort to secure funding. Additionally, I had to consider the loss of income from being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It’s nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just be discussing my past; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My preparation for the Olympics was tough, with my life focused on getting in the best shape; but looking back, it was quite simple. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training program was set, and there were doctors and dieticians. I was worried about how people would react to me racing with a TV presenter. I feared it would seem like I just wanted to be on TV, otherwise I would have chosen a better partner to win the race. However, my concerns faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. However, he couldn’t row well. I was surprised by how little natural ability he had for rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of understanding. I could have been more patient, but I felt it was important to be honest with Ben about the significant improvements he needed to make. I should have realized that this would be his level when I agreed to race with him."""
104,"Text: 

Just over a year ago, I left my job in London to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, vast landscapes, perhaps because I was tired of the noise and crowds of the city. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a position as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow and ice, for trips ranging from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now have over 100. Recently, they acquired a second location called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but warned me that the hours would be long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical. I began packing right away.

November 6, London  
On my flight, I stared at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names before I arrived, but I felt distracted and anxious. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. I remembered that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. However, I felt like I was witnessing winter moving south, as rivers froze over.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta  
The bus ride north was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests of thin conifer trees weighed down by snow, stopping occasionally for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I entered, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. Anna asked, ""Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?"" It was a rhetorical question. I followed the sound of barking, which grew louder as I approached the dogsheds. Three people were running back and forth, pulling huskies out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs were excited, straining against their ropes. I could barely introduce myself, but the others were too busy to talk. I stood to the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestured for me to join in, and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and we took off into the dark, guided only by a headlamp.

November 15, Hetta  
I quickly learned the basics of being a husky guide, but first, I faced a challenging quiz about my skills. ""Are you useful?"" Anna asked. I was unsure. Further questions revealed that I was not very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. Finally, someone asked if I had a driving license, and I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. However, other tasks were complicated. Simple things like feeding and watering the dogs became difficult in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head was full of instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by eager huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw—in the snow!"""
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was fast enough to qualify for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a natural remedy, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had suggested to help heal injuries Radcliffe suffered when she accidentally collided with a bike during training. Radcliffe claims that the significance of her achievement didn’t fully hit her at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a major accomplishment, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day, so it didn’t feel overwhelming. She and her support team had decided not to set any limits, following their motto: no limits.

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent expressed concern about her pace, fearing it might cause her to drop out. Hartmann was frustrated by this worry, although he acknowledged that anyone unfamiliar with her fitness might see it as a risk to start so quickly.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe began to calculate her finish time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. After running 41 kilometers at a fast pace, she managed to sprint the final distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never expected to see anyone come close to that time for a long time, and she thought, ""I will come back and do it next year."" Unfortunately, that did not happen.

After the race, many were curious about how an athlete with such an unusual running style had outperformed the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had spent weeks with Radcliffe, providing daily training sessions to support her as she covered 250-300 kilometers each week. He stated, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one on the treatment table could handle that level of pain. She would push me to my limits; I had to ice my thumbs afterward because I was in so much pain.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no friendly greeting or offer of tea; as soon as he arrived, she was ready for a two-hour training session. ""Paula would push you to your limits. That's what made her so exceptional."" During this time, Hartmann dedicated so much of his energy to Radcliffe that his other athletes became frustrated.

Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner) might achieve it. Maybe it's because people are competing against each other rather than focusing on their own performance."" What does she mean by that? ""It's about that mental attitude of never easing up, even when you’re winning. That mindset probably helped me because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always about pushing myself as hard as I could."" Radcliffe did not realize at the time that this marathon would be the peak of her career; she would never run that fast again. However, she did inspire many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"Text: ""When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. There was a lot of discussion about a 'food revolution' happening in Britain, and I believed we had created a series that contributed something new to this movement. However, I worried whether people would appreciate a cooking approach that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science. I watched the first episode feeling both excited and anxious. Fortunately, the show was successful, leading to many other interesting projects, including a book based on my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques.

I later wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection,' each linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving passports, suitcases, and travel plans. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet remarkable artisans, like a man who dedicates his life to making golden pasta that tastes exceptional. These artisans have spent years pursuing their own ideas of perfection. 

Perfection is subjective. Even choosing which dishes to feature in the series was challenging, and I knew I would disappoint some people by not including their favorites. I could imagine them asking, 'Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?' However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we created a list that would satisfy many tastes. This experience reinforced my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, shaped by personal emotions, memories, and environments.

Despite the book's title, I never claimed the recipes were 'definitive.' I believed that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation—trying ideas and refining them until something unique emerges.

The TV series allowed me to explore various foods, people, and places I had never seen in restaurants. I was excited to delve into memory and nostalgia in food, as I began my career in a similar way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, such as visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which forced us to stop filming. While refining each recipe, I even hand-milked a cow and used dry ice to make ice cream, cooked chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burned my house down trying to heat the oven for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza."""
107,"Text: 'We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking like he knew what he was doing. “Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,” he finally admitted, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field went on for miles, filled with grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, as it was best to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I shared a story about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them everything the birds discussed: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind; they waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was a little away from the road, not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade of the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it started to get dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on solid ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home now that our van had to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.'"
108,"Text: Lucy was at a welcome party in the hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were older than her by about ten years. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city whose name Lucy didn’t quite catch. They spoke good English and discussed the music they were playing and their recent travels. Lucy mentioned, “I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer.” It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco.

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which selected only fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She had been chosen from thousands of applicants. Her dad celebrated by buying her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mother had filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought, “More like you didn’t want to give me the chance to say no.” Back then, she believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t think about refusing.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in, seeming surprised. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He exchanged a look with the girl, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag; it was hard to know when sharing was showing off. “It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying…” The girl then looked across the room, as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, shaggy hair, like many musicians, showing they were cool in their own way. “Once, when I was about eight.” He started to respond when Lucy's grandfather appeared beside her. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition.” “Everyone is the competition.” 

Her grandfather took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after leaving the party, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” She liked that part—being someone important—even if it meant some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she received. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov piece perfectly. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘Spending too much time online isn’t good for you. You should spend more time in the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I decided to look into what experts say about this topic – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have a large group of real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are developing important technical skills needed in today’s digital world. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, states that ‘social networking is now a key part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do; they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, describes it as ‘the modern version of hanging out at the youth club, where today’s parents used to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club.’ He explains that it helps teenagers form their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues while connecting with their peers. 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says, ‘Adolescence is a time for self-discovery. Social networking can help you find your identity: you can share your favorite music or sports, explore your interests, and see that others have different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can be helpful for shy people: ‘Communicating online can feel easier than face-to-face, and it allows you to practice social skills in a less stressful setting.’ 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can be beneficial for quiet individuals with specific interests because they connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of similar people, you can feel part of a community and still be popular in a different way,’ he explains. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘Young people who discover new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals, and create their own content are truly making the most of social networks.’ She believes social networking is becoming a creative outlet: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing how creativity is expressed. Enthusiastic photographers can connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their passion. ‘This enhances employability and will be valuable in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to promote and build brand awareness – understanding how it works is essential. For instance, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on various social networks, they could all be potential customers. Linking these networks creates your customer base.’ 

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, agrees Matthews. ‘One great aspect of many sites is the chance to collaborate with others to create and share content. Collaboration is a vital skill in the 21st century and is important for being employable in a digital world.’"""

When people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet getaway when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he thought was the ultimate family bonding experience. “Not enough people do this anymore,” he and my mother said repeatedly before our trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, “There must be good reasons for that!”

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a variety of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. Still, I had some strategies to cope. With barely enough space left for us, we began “The Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our spacious home for smaller places over the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we had gotten ourselves into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. I noticed a pattern: the desert changed to mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we experienced the strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next destination, we realized that the roads marked for Jeeps were best for actual Jeep drivers.

Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. Disappointment turned to laughter when we took pictures next to the large “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. “Bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross, were common, and our close encounter with a bear (and a worried park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories.

As we drove, life back home faded away. Even the hotel we stayed in, which was an old building with no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t dampen our excitement. In exchange for these inconveniences, I experienced some of the most beautiful views I’ve ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, my family and I headed back south. My parents were right: you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something amazing. 

Returning home together was a mix of emotions, but at least I hadn’t argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our journey to look through and remember. I knew that the moments I would cherish most were the unplanned and spontaneous ones."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy needed to finish her last year of school, so it was better for her to remain at the college where she had the best room, complete with a kitchen and study area. She also had free access to the Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. 

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had vague memories of Daisy from past holidays and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was eager to reconnect with Rose. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents had issues with her grandmother, but there had been a disagreement in the past, leading to summers spent away from Daisy. Rose remembered her last goodbye at age ten, and those memories were happy. Dahlia had said that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and had a talent for bringing people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not a typical frail old lady; she seemed to attend more social events than anyone else.

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She understood healthy eating, fitness, and the importance of sleep. However, she wanted one thing: her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission every time. She believed she could be trusted with these small things. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or curfews, and she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood.

Dahlia had given Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, which made Rose very happy. They all agreed that it would be about trust from now on. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it again.

Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her a lot. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years of school. For Rose, it was a new chapter in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first person to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed challenging, and she wasn’t aware of what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to give it a try. Now, the novel she started at that age is about to be published. Recently, she told her former teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. She had thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte found this surprising because she didn’t see why she should wait to pursue something she might be good at.

It’s a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a significant achievement: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except for the age of its main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support, but she doesn’t. She is independent, lively, and intelligent, but also calm, which keeps her from being overly confident.

Charlotte recognizes the limits of her youth. When I ask her about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She laughs and adds, “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t consider myself particularly wise. I was just interested in the theme of taking responsibility.”

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often misrepresented in fiction. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the socially awkward teenager. Reading about these character types frustrated her. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who aren’t inadequate in some way. Some writers unintentionally give the impression that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience, and that can hurt their self-confidence.”

Charlotte has always enjoyed reading famous fantasy authors, but their work almost discouraged her from writing. “My favorite fantasy books explore deep psychological themes. I wondered if I needed to write like that to create a good book and if I was capable of it.” However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which advises that if readers start to guess what will happen next, the suspense is likely gone.

Some might argue that Charlotte’s parents, both journalists, played a key role in getting her novel published. Her father’s connection in publishing helped her book get read initially. She acknowledges her good luck, as it is difficult for anyone to get a first novel read, regardless of their age. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you’re on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."

“Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,” said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. “Now, who wants to go first?” The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show he knew what he was doing, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp quickly and flew into the air, arms flailing. Even to our inexperienced eyes, something seemed off. We held our breath. He landed hard, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. “Remember,” Gareth kindly reminded us, “speed can be unpredictable.” 

Maybe freestyle skiing wasn’t for me. On previous skiing trips, I had enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I felt that if I tried to join the skateboarders, with their baggy pants and special language, I would be laughed at. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. It had a large indoor facility with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, where students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits – not exactly a realistic start for what awaited us on the slopes. 

After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their moves for real. “Progression is inevitable!” the centre’s slogan cheerfully promised. “Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,” said Gareth. “But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.” The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope steepens again for landing. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which reduces impact. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important. 

At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore what my brain was telling me and to race towards the jump. My legs seemed to go into reverse as I neared the launch point, and I landed hard on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt exhausted. “You need to control the jump, not let it control you,” said Gareth. 

Day two began on the trampolines. I thought I would dislike being indoors, looking at the snowy mountains outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some drills mimicked ski-jumping moves, while others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – understanding what your body is doing while spinning in the air. Gareth provided a running commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – every time I tried, I was aware of the moment before take-off, and then nothing until I found myself lying in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. 

We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more challenges before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I forced myself to keep my speed up as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly in the landing zone. Then I noticed both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."
114,"Text: 'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your palms are sweaty with fear, and your nails dig into the harness as the ride comes to a stop. You take a deep breath before the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There is a pause, then a sudden drop that makes your stomach feel weightless. With your teeth clenched, you speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you let out a scream of fear. But you have only yourself to blame: like millions of others each year, you chose to pay to enter the theme park. 

What is interesting to me is that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides designed to attract crowds, are a massive industry. To create the excitement and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers, designers, and marketing experts working behind the scenes. The idea of being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a childhood dream, but it is actually a significant challenge. Designers must find the right balance between fun and fear while ensuring the safety of passengers. They also need to introduce new features to keep visitors interested. 

While many people think that rollercoasters have become more intense over time, most of the techniques used today, like the wheels that allow rides to go upside down, were developed by US designer John Miller in the early 20th century. During his 'golden age' of rollercoasters, many extreme designs were tested, often to the discomfort of riders. Now, designers must work within the limits set by specialized ride manufacturers. 

I spoke to three experts in rollercoaster design. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer' with a background in aeronautics, explained that the skill lies in putting all the elements together. Dr. John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, added that it involves quickly alternating between feelings of excitement and safety, so riders feel thrilled but not unsafe. 

To create an exceptional ride, the teams behind rollercoasters must develop a strong story, whether it’s a space adventure or a fast-paced jungle chase, that complements any new features like the tallest drops or most twists. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, intuition, experience, and trial-and-error are crucial. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that it helps to be passionate about thrills to understand what riders want and to test the rides before they open to the public. 

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would need to adopt new technologies, like virtual reality. Walker responded that while virtual reality can enhance the experience, it is not a replacement for the physical thrill of a rollercoaster. He believes that the traditional rollercoaster experience will continue to be the main attraction for many years.'"
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both activities in her busy life. She explains, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the instructions of demanding choreographers, and how stressful that can be. Choreographers can forget what it feels like to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, she takes on a teaching role and enjoys working with young students. “A beginner dancer is often open to trying new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They are eager for success but don’t yet fully understand their strengths and weaknesses. Their unclear view of their skills helps them accept even tough criticism. However, they might still question what I say, and I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, letting the music guide her. “There might be music I don’t like, but I still aim to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I won’t go back and choose a new piece. Ideally, I’d like to experiment more and have the option to switch music – it would definitely help improve the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I often work on large productions where the music is already decided by the composer.”

Miranda does not want to be tied to one institution. “I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. However, I must remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. So, I need to adapt my approach each time I go somewhere new, rather than just repeat what I’ve done before. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

The conversation shifts to a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,” Miranda says. “This one tries to show an accurate picture of life in a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer receives many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that moment. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch but very real. The public often underestimates the amount of work and dedication required in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great ballet or dance production. “It’s when everything the company has put in – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to expect, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can allow for a few artistic mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps are excellent, but something about the costumes or props is distracting, and that’s disappointing.”

Given her wide range of work, I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? “People often want to label you, and I don’t quite understand that. There’s also a modern trend to encourage expertise in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, but maybe one day I’ll be happy to be known for one thing. For now, I just want to expand my horizons.”"
116,"Text: ""A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that there are amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. A friend was giving away his old sofa, which became the main focus of the film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and attached old seatbelts over my shoulders. I placed my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to keep going. I have done many walking trips in recent years, but this was completely different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads, which allowed me to stop at roadside cafés and enjoy a cappuccino on the sofa instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."""
117,"Text: 'When I read about guided swimming trips around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still seemed confused, he smiled and showed me on board. 

Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would follow us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first proper swim of 1.5 km, which made me nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. However, I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The following days had a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the scenery. As the swims became longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. I felt less need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come back again next year.'"

I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting, which makes it a great job for someone young like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family, so I often flew alone at the beginning and end of each term. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed in my mind when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for a new path. 

At the interview, there were many young people, and many were hired. They were often well-qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say, focusing on my strengths and past work experience, rather than just saying I loved to travel, which everyone else would say. This approach helped me get the job! 

I would recommend this job to anyone because there are many rewarding aspects, although the free flights are not the main reason. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: 'no one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family; even if we don’t see each other often, we are still close. When I am not working, I don’t have to take work home with me. If I do encounter difficult passengers, which is rare, I remind myself that the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"""
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I enjoy watching the children achieve things they never thought they could. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before arriving, but rock climbing is a new challenge for many. Some feel nervous at first, but with encouragement, they try and eventually reach the top, which makes them feel proud. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home, especially those aged ten to thirteen. We limit their mobile phone use; they can call home after lunch, but when they ask again after dinner, we tell them it’s too late and suggest they call the next day. Most children adjust within a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they thank us for a great experience.

Interestingly, it’s not just the children who feel lonely. Some parents frequently call to check on their child, which is often unnecessary. Their child is usually busy playing games or engaging in activities, so we ask the parents to call back later. We also notice a certain type of child who comes dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into more appropriate attire, but they soon understand the reason behind our request."

It opened in London last year after five successful years in the USA, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting together an all-British cast was challenging. The UK has stricter rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. As a result, the production needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors based in the UK, and they recently won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The London theatre is larger than the venue in the USA, and it has been full every night, with audiences eager to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are, mentioning, ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

I asked Jamie what his classmates thought of the show. He replied, ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them.’ When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to join him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was relieved that the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes!

Although the young actors were already musicians, some playing multiple instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
