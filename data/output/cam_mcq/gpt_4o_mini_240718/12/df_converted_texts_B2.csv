Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling many people about your location, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, which can seem exciting: wealth and fame are possible! However, we often realize too late that sharing too much can be dangerous and confusing.

But don’t lose hope. There is guidance from early internet users who explored these challenges before us. In the beginning of the web, they faced many difficulties, lost jobs, and dealt with the temptations of fame long before social media existed. These early users, known as bloggers, have valuable experiences to share. It’s important to learn from their stories.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web, which was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a chance to share his own life. He created a personal website filled with his stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, and many people were interested in his adventures as he explored this new medium. Hall was open about everything; he would post about anyone who crossed his path. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the art in his work.

One day, visitors to Hall’s site found it changed. His homepage was replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the problem remains: sharing online can be great, but if you think it will make people want to be with you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they wouldn’t say in person. However, the internet is not a separate world where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong’s story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she later got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is successful as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once known for her online mistakes, she has learned to share her life carefully. What Armstrong teaches us is important: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."

Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This film mixes documentary and drama to suggest that there is much about our universe that we do not understand. How can any scientist disagree with that? Scientists can sometimes be arrogant, but even the most enthusiastic physicist would not claim to know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt it was important to warn the public about the film, calling it everything from ‘atrocious’ to ‘very dangerous.’ This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I didn’t understand why there was so much concern. Various scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries show that the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film discussed some of these discoveries, I began to understand the concern. One claim was that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. I had heard about a Japanese researcher who suggested that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the film only showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to by happy people and ugly after being exposed to angry people. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is clear and easy to understand. But scientists often respond with skepticism, saying, “Give me a break.” 

I understand their point. The idea that water can be affected by thoughts is fascinating and could mean there are new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Beautiful pictures of crystals are not enough. 

The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that is causing the universe to expand. This idea is supported by decades of research from scientists around the world. In fact, discoveries are being made that show the universe is indeed stranger than we ever thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy.’ 

On a more practical level, scientists are making amazing discoveries. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they actually occur, but we don’t notice this delay because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are connections between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Despite what some people might think, science is not close to being complete. In fact, we seem to know less than we once believed. Many natural phenomena may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the world’s top physicists are trying to create a Theory of Everything, which would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. 

In summary, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"Text: ""In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, while writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden. Both processes work together to create a beautiful landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a group of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I don’t write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing may use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my beginning as a short-story writer.

One of the joys of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can take longer). It’s not the same level of commitment as writing a novel, which can take a year or two. For me, writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. So, writing short stories is a nice change of pace.

Another great thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas – a thought, a word, an image, or anything. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, where the story leads me. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This gives me comfort. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I have in writing short stories. In this way, short stories are like a testing ground for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment the way I want to within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, faint traces of my thoughts. I remember exactly where I placed each one and how I felt when I did. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."""

Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, but it is also very practical, helping to cure diseases. It has made our lives easier but can also pose threats to our existence. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often struggles to do so. It has influenced poets, politicians, and thinkers, and while its beauty is clear to some, its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and the mistakes made by scientists are often ignored or exaggerated.

The history of science is full of conflict. Old theories are constantly being changed or replaced, similar to how new music styles are sometimes mocked before becoming popular. Scientists can be jealous and angry, and the history of science shows that conflict is common. This book will focus on the ideas in science that have changed not just science itself but also how we think about many things. While science has practical uses, we will mainly explore its ideas and their beauty, while also being aware of the limitations of human understanding.

Science is always changing. There is always a scientist challenging the ideas of another. Most of the time, these changes do not disrupt society, but sometimes they can shake our established beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Now, physics has questioned many basic ideas, leading us to understand that observing the universe can change it, and we often do not fully understand our own concepts.

Some people think that the changing nature of scientific theories shows that science cannot explain the universe. However, these changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. For instance, Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. Science may make mistakes, but it continues to progress. 

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists believed there was nothing important left to discover. Then came major breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, and the discovery of the electron. Biology has also made significant advances. Today, some people claim that a complete theory explaining everything about the universe is close. 

Science is not just a harmless activity. In the last two centuries, we have moved from being observers of nature to having some control over it. This has sometimes upset the balance of nature in ways we do not fully understand. It is important for everyone, not just scientists, to understand scientific advances because they will shape the future for our children and the world they will live in. The way we manipulate the future is not just a philosophical question; it can have real effects on budgets, health, and the future of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased in some cases. This raised new doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can exist together, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books still comes up. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this idea, it is important to note that the potential loss of printed books continues to spark our imagination and create strong discussions. 

Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding change and innovation. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium replacing another often appears with new technologies. Even before digital technology, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many believed that radio would disappear. However, radio survived by finding new ways to be used, such as listening in cars or during commutes.

The idea of books disappearing is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been thought to threaten print books as sources of culture and entertainment. Some believed that the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks in a hopeful digital future. 

The idea that books might disappear often arises during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our mixed feelings about technology. To understand why we react this way, we must consider that we form emotional connections with different media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show that we develop strong bonds with objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. Therefore, when new technology, like e-readers, appears, it not only signals economic and social change but also forces us to rethink our relationship with something that has become a part of our daily lives. As technology evolves, we often miss what we used to know but no longer have. This is why entire industries grow around older products and technologies.

For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek out original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older format. The same happened when photography changed from analog to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a new appreciation for the physical qualities of printed books, even their unique smell. This should reassure those who worry about the decline of print books. However, the idea of disappearing media will continue to be an interesting story about the power of technology and our fear of change. 

One way we try to understand change is by using familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings. These stories are easy to remember and share, and the narrative of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, ourselves."

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday morning at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time. I wanted to explore how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By writing about the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to show a different side of their personalities and careers. 

The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I believe, “Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.” This book is not just about the results of creative work; it focuses on the process of how that work is done. It is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a simple business letter reveals something about the writer. 

I face similar questions in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work on it a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not claim to answer these questions, as some may only be resolved individually. However, I provide examples of how many successful people have dealt with these challenges. 

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary and thoughtless, but it can also be a useful tool for managing limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine helps direct our mental energy and can prevent us from being controlled by our moods. The psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule.

This book was inspired by my own procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, while working at a small architecture magazine, I was supposed to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself cleaning my workspace and making coffee. I am a “morning person,” able to concentrate well in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was simple; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I have gathered a much larger and better-researched collection while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I have let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was not interested in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period; instead, he was fascinated by the very beginnings of life and the ancient creatures found in grey rocks.

After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard worried about finding a job. He was confident in his abilities, but he knew that hard work does not always lead to success. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied, but did not expect much. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife, drove his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview happened without him, and a colleague who did not like Howard’s former professor took his place on the panel. This colleague helped Howard get the job, even though Howard was surprised by this unexpected support.

At first, Howard was grateful, but later he learned the truth about how he got the job. He felt a little disappointed because he wanted to believe he was chosen for his skills. However, what mattered most was that he had the job and could do the work he loved. He often thought about how organized his professional life was, where he could plan and achieve goals, compared to the chaos of personal life. 

One day, Howard's briefcase, which contained notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he returned to the college, called to explain, and postponed the lecture. After reporting the theft, he went for a coffee and met a colleague who was with a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This conversation led Howard to learn about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied, which would be a great opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University who enjoys trying unusual foods. He mentions that he has ice cream made from bee larvae at home, which may look strange but supposedly tastes a bit nutty and floral. Spence and his team are working on making bug-eating more acceptable. His research focuses on how our senses work together to shape our experience of taste. This research influences what we eat and drink, from large food companies to high-end restaurant menus.

Spence studies many factors that affect how we taste food, such as who we eat with, how food is presented, and even the color and weight of plates and cutlery. His book, The Perfect Meal, co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, shares interesting facts about food. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal more, and we tend to eat 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab is simple and not high-tech. It has soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with chefs who cannot afford to fund research. Much of his work is supported by a large food company. In the past, research funded by the food industry was often looked down upon in universities. However, now it is seen as valuable because universities need to show their work has an impact.

Spence helps food brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Interestingly, many companies make these changes slowly so that customers do not notice. Spence explains that when people know about these changes, they tend to focus on the taste and may not like it as much.

Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was strange, but Spence believed it was important. Their collaboration led to the creation of a dish called ""Sound of the Sea,"" which uses sound to enhance the dining experience. Spence notes that even in the early 1900s, artists were experimenting with sounds and food, but it did not become popular then.

Now, the food industry is using Spence's research in many ways. For example, he found that higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. An airline is planning to match music with the food served to passengers, and a well-known brand recently released an app that plays music while ice cream melts, although they did not match the music to the taste.

At home, Spence has had some unique dinner parties. One time, they ate rabbit with the fur still on the cutlery, and another time, they used remote-controlled colored lights. He has even hosted dinners with sound generators and different drinks to see how they affect taste. For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and gastronomy conferences are all part of his research."

Our brains are working harder than ever. We are overwhelmed with facts, false information, and rumors that we must sort through to find what is important. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we handle most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage many responsibilities, including our families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. These devices have become part of our busy lives, filling every free moment with activities.

However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking—doing several things at once—this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks. Each time we switch, it costs us mental energy. Instead of being like expert jugglers, we are more like amateur plate spinners, moving from one task to another and worrying about what we might forget.

Even though we feel productive, multitasking can make us less efficient. It increases stress hormones in our bodies, which can lead to confusion and difficulty thinking clearly. Multitasking also creates a desire for constant stimulation, making it hard to focus. The part of our brain that helps us concentrate can easily be distracted by new things, like shiny objects that attract attention.

Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a psychologist, found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. He discovered that the mental losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking can send information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information may not be stored properly, making it harder to remember later.

Additionally, multitasking often involves making decisions, like whether to reply to a text message. Making decisions can be tiring for our brains, and small decisions can use as much mental energy as big ones. After making many small choices, we may struggle to make good decisions about important matters.

In discussions about information overload, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not that email itself is bad, but the huge amount of messages we receive can be overwhelming. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does, he said, ""He answers emails."" His father agreed that this was quite accurate. We feel we must respond to emails, but it can be hard to do that and accomplish other tasks."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not considered important. Animals had behaviors that led to measurable results, and science focused on those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral systems was seen as sentimental. However, this view has started to change. Research on the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions, which was once a taboo subject. This change has influenced popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has sparked a debate that may never be fully answered: do animals have consciousness? This debate leads to another question about conscience, which is a person’s sense of right and wrong that guides their actions. 

In a recent experiment with cows, it was found that cows that opened a locked gate to get food showed more happiness—by jumping and kicking—than those that had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we produce and eat beef? While the observations are not disputed, their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes that the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is close to a major change in ethics, similar to the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should reconsider how we view animal thinking. He argues that animals likely have a simpler understanding of the mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail suggests we should avoid attributing human feelings to animals. These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks?

Balcombe describes an important experiment he conducted that seems to show that starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups were initially fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and they learned to only take from the tasty box. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, “We look back with horror on a time of racism. Our view of animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar beliefs. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He says, “What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. At the start of the 20th century, some people thought animals thought just like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are moving back in that direction. But this is a very controversial topic, and we should be careful of academics with strong personal opinions.”"

Critical thinking is a way to engage with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., believes that arguing can help us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it is changing how we solve complex problems and making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but attractive ideas, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. He notes that having more information does not always lead to better knowledge or decision-making. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading literature, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, thinks that focusing more on visual media, like videos, may be hurting our critical thinking skills. She says that people are multitasking and not concentrating on one thing. However, we still do not have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology has changed how we think, and it can have both positive and negative effects. For example, a computer game might help improve critical thinking or make it worse. Reading online can enhance our analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links can prevent deeper thinking. Greenfield has studied how learning and technology interact and found that reading helps develop imagination and critical thinking, while visual media like video games and TV do not engage the imagination in the same way. 

However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media do not give us time to reflect or analyze. This can lead to many young people not reaching their full potential. How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. 

James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, points out that video games are often seen as harmful to children. However, he argues that they can be a good learning tool. Evidence shows that playing video games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in ways that feel real. These games also allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life. 

In today's digital age, as reading and math scores go down, it is important to examine how technology affects our thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the benefits of manual work, while his latest book discusses how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on a credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford realized that these distractions are hard to avoid. What we want to think about at any moment is personal, but we often cannot decide this for ourselves because of things we do not notice. It is becoming harder to think or remember conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, we often stop talking to strangers. Crawford says, “We increasingly encounter the world through representations that are often manipulative, like video games and apps.” These representations reflect our desires and can take over our lives.

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many office workers complain about emails but still spend their free time checking them. Studies show that our attention can wander if a phone is just visible on the table. Although there is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Some people think this problem is caused by technology, but Crawford believes technology has made it easier for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control our attention, which affects our social lives. We often prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. By only interacting with representations of people, we risk losing important connections in society.

Crawford gives an example from his gym. In the past, there was one music player for everyone, which could create tension because people had different tastes. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds, and the gym has lost its social atmosphere. Real connections often happen through conflict, like discussing different music preferences.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to manage noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world in a more meaningful way. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people who deal with real materials. No representation can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under motorcycle tires. These roles require good judgment and the ability to interact with others.

Crawford argues that when we engage with the world this way, we see that manufactured experiences are not as fulfilling as real ones. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment. There are many benefits to this approach, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, paying attention to one thing helps us pay attention to others."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. It feels more acceptable to say you study or teach philosophy, but claiming to be a philosopher might suggest you think you know some special truth. This idea is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. Still, this stereotype makes me think twice before answering.

One reason for this stereotype is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical thinking, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers agree with him, philosophy is still often linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting what society says can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to reflect on the world helps us take control of our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not mean you have to read many philosophical books or dedicate your life to deep thinking. It just means paying more attention to the everyday experiences that shape our lives. You don’t have to be a wise person living away from society to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is important for a good life.

Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more distant from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are often linked to expensive academic journals. Because of this, philosophers have fewer chances to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. For many people, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. While some philosophers used to challenge this view, many have accepted it. The academic environment has created a sense of isolation, and as philosophy has become more focused on specific debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully describe my work, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. There is a new trend in philosophy where ethics is seen as applied ethics, which examines the fairness of specific social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ethical or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading movies is unethical (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people think more deeply about the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we may confirm what we already believe; other times, we might find that our beliefs are hard to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we can benefit everyone."

People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, throughout history, discussions about food in philosophy have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers talk about eating, they often use it as a way to discuss something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, conversations that seem to be about food actually explore different but related ideas.

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Although he talked about many activities, his name has become closely linked to enjoying food and drink. You can see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites. These businesses likely hope to attract customers by connecting their products to a famous philosopher.

Food is also a social and cultural experience. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities help us find dining partners and provide the systems for growing and distributing food. We interact with food more often and in more important ways than with other products, making it a clear topic for philosophical discussion.

Once food is prepared, critics begin to talk and write about it. But why do these critics have such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, good food critics are just better at describing flavors. This area has not been studied much in philosophy, as most research on perception has focused on sight. This should change.

Another important aspect of food is its beauty. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, with the growth of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed in terms of beauty, just like art or poetry. However, food is eaten and disappears, unlike paintings or music, which can be enjoyed over time. Because of this, it is not correct to think of food as a true object of beauty.

There are also many ethical questions related to food. For example, we can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? The answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will always question why we choose what we do. This kind of academic discussion about food is important.

Another topic is how cooking in restaurants differs from cooking at home. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone shares food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more like colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we can learn to appreciate others by enjoying their food, and second, we can build personal connections with people from other cultures by sharing meals. This practice has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not exciting or challenging enough, so he began to think about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect future games? He modified a classic game called Risk to create a new version called Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and long-lasting rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau was then invited to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy received a lot of praise, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not come from an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to make sure the story stays strong. To do this, they use testers to see how the games will play out. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. He said, ‘It takes a lot of time. The first few games might go well, but then after a few more games, it can start to fall apart, and you have to go back and fix everything.’

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was developing the idea, he thought it would appeal to only a small group of people. He said, ‘I thought it was different and pretty good, but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I expected it to be successful with just a few people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest improvements in game design in recent years. He said, ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement. There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than to learn a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of an unfolding story outweighed any worries about the game lasting a long time. He mentioned, ‘At first, I was worried about making changes and possibly ruining my board, but that concern was eased by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice in the cinema, right? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling aspect similar to video games.’ The legacy format is influenced not only by video games but also by the popularity of episodic entertainment from TV series. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and then game design. Still, he loved telling stories.

Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, ‘You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but it’s not enough to just have a general plan.’ While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is curious to see how others will use the idea. He also tries to downplay its importance, thinking that gamers will soon ask, ‘What’s next?’ Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is not so sure. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."

Not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared a lot online. People enjoy these escape stories about animals, like rats and llamas, because they like to think of animals as being similar to humans. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very intelligent and look very different from us. They can do things like open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in clever ways.

Some people think that comparing animals to humans is not scientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually wrong to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this idea ""anthropodenial."" He has studied many years of research on animal intelligence and found that, except for having a fully developed language, animals show many behaviors that we thought only humans could do. These behaviors include remembering the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding what others might want.

In the past, people believed that animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the 1800s, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world, said that the difference between humans and higher animals is one of degree, not kind. 

In the 20th century, a new way of thinking called behaviorism became popular. This view saw animals as machines that respond to rewards and punishments. Many people who thought animals had feelings were seen as unrealistic. This change in thinking happened at the same time that humans were destroying animal habitats and polluting the environment.

Dr. de Waal believes we are starting to understand animal intelligence better now. He says that we are learning to see animal thinking as similar to human thinking, even if they are not the same. He notes that there is a lot of new information about animal intelligence available online.

To test animal intelligence, it is important to consider what each species is good at. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might look at how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, the octopus might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is not completely convinced that Inky’s escape had a happy ending. He thinks it is too hopeful to believe that Inky knew how to find the drain to the ocean. However, he understands that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (which they like) and others received grapes (which they like even more), the monkeys with cucumbers got very upset when they saw the others getting grapes. This study was published in a well-known scientific journal, but what really made people believe it was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our understanding of animal minds can be surprising."

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to what happened during industrialisation. Robots have been used in car manufacturing and other industries for many years, but experts believe we are about to see a big increase in the use of robots in many areas. Many people think that robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people also believe their current jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not. Every industry will be affected by robots in the coming years.

For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This task would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is Tally, a robot from a San Francisco startup, which moves around supermarkets to check that products are in stock and correctly priced, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot yet fix or program themselves, which could lead to new jobs for technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not forget the importance of human skills in the workplace. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come from reducing human interaction.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His recent report predicts that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work safely with humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled because there aren’t enough skilled workers.

Zhang says that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes that these workers should not wait for the government to protect their jobs but should find ways to retrain themselves. People can no longer expect to do the same job for their entire lives.

At the same time, advances in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, such as robots that can walk and live in our homes and interact with us in new ways. Zhang sees this as a great opportunity for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy.

With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce that will include robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is reported to have answered a question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response reflects a common curiosity: why do people take part in such dangerous activities? Some may find inspiration in his answer, as it encourages individuals to pursue their dreams and face challenges. However, the main point is that climbing can simply be about adventure and enjoyment.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different climbing activities, from playing on small rocks to climbing high mountains, each with its own rules. He argued that the way climbers approach a climb depends on the rules of the specific activity. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and casual conversations.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing brings. However, climbing can also feel restrictive. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing. Yet, some argue that having limited choices can simplify a climber's life, which can also feel like a form of freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of our nature; humans are built to take on challenges and test their limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing is more about our biology than logical reasoning.

US academic Brian Treanor also contributed to this discussion. He believes that climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While he acknowledges that not all climbers show these traits, he thinks they are especially important in today's world, which often avoids risks. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits by helping people grow and thrive outside of climbing.

Another interesting idea is that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be fully dedicated to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that climbs done independently are more impressive than those completed with large teams or with the help of tools like bottled oxygen. This claim raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also explore climbing from a different perspective. Many climbers report experiences like being fully present in the moment or going with the flow. The physical effort of climbing, the focused meditation during a climb, and the intuitive problem-solving involved are all key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of peace. This offers another idea to consider when thinking about why people are attracted to climbing."

For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known for being serious and intellectual, focusing on important European piano works. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he taught very few students. Those who knew him saw a playful side, but this was rarely shown in his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was around 14 years old at the time. Brendel listened to him play and said, “He played remarkably well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a recital he had performed, and I thought, ‘I have to make time for him.’ It was a performance that connected beautifully from start to finish. It’s rare to find a musician with such understanding and subtlety.”

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to make his own way in the music world. Kit, now 19, is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps a close watch on him. He also composes music. Brendel says, “This is very important. Learning to read music is easier when you try to write your own. I noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and is a great sight reader. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and understands what I explain to him. When I tell him something about a piece, he applies it throughout the entire piece.”

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, saying, “That’s the worst thing to say. It can cause a lot of harm. Like many talented young musicians, he can play some pieces incredibly well, while others need more time and practice. It would be unfair for a critic to expect perfection.”

Now at 80 years old, Brendel shows a softer side in his retirement. He explains, “When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I hoped to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I turned 50, I felt I had accomplished most of those goals, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Although I don’t have the physical strength I once had, my mind is always active with many pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform now, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.”"
20,"Text: ""When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My Grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic covering broken glass.

At home, my father was often quiet. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed silly things. He liked to say, ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ instead of just saying ‘I don’t mind.’ Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was good at fixing things around the house, whether it was bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing the furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it felt intimidating. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it. My mother thought they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn’t get the chance, she simply said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or river – I always chose the river. I could imagine another world there. With a fishing net over my shoulder and old sandals on my feet, I would walk along the riverbank looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and have a picnic. I would carefully look through the water for fish to catch, but after failing to keep them alive in the backyard, I returned them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until one day my father said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, he went against his usual thoughts. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think that deep down, he hoped things would turn out well for me if I worked hard. Maybe I’m wrong, but I believe that even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw my enthusiasm for it and appreciated my passion for plants and flowers."""
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is crouching down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am doing the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic threatens to blow us off the steep cliff at our feet and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and his owner gently strokes him. Despite the howling wind, MacEwen feels comfortable on his island, where he belongs. 

MacEwen shows me around his neighborhood. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s tall mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, MacEwen says, “I have sheep to move,” as rain starts to come our way. We walk down the slopes, and he shares some facts about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3,000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie is not doing a good job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” means the dog should go to the right, but he goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says with disappointment. The dog looks ashamed. 

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm; their son Colin manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry.” 

However, life on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “There is reception on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone away.” So I do the same. 

Everything on Muck feels wonderfully surprising. A boat arrives today with groceries and three musicians who come off carrying instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with the islanders tapping their feet to the music. 

That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay in a newspaper and bought it without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know how to run a farm? “She had good typing skills.” 

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and give it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is delicious. 

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months because of rough seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I would not mind at all."

The game design industry was once mostly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals. It used to be seen as just a hobby for young people, but now it is taken seriously. This change may surprise some, but experts in the industry are not surprised. However, getting into this field is not easy. Creating video games based on new movies requires many team members and a lot of skill and hard work. Like many industries, it can be hard to enter, but it is growing.

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, ""It is very difficult to make progress in big companies or to influence major games. But the industry needs game designers now more than ever. They need not just top-level directors but also those who design systems and individual parts of the game.""

So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim has a different opinion. He believes, ""The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed on your own if you are not making things. Game design is more than just a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real.""

Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it is more complicated. ""There are many people who want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements today. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense needed to contribute to this changing field."" 

Can you succeed on your own? John says, ""Maybe, but it is quite difficult. A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and have a strong interest in the arts and modern culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but have realized that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in this field. 

Connections can also help. This is often ignored, but to succeed in games, as in many other areas, you need to network."" The old image of a young boy playing video games has changed. Now, games attract a wider audience, including families who play on interactive consoles. Smartphones also offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of potential for growth. ""Games have become popular among larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this area as full of new possibilities and opportunities."""
23,"Text: ""Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very strict about football. He always told him what he could and couldn’t do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing. I’m glad that didn’t happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score a great goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score amazing goals by practicing. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players collide on the field, but I learned the right techniques. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills. 

At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, football was my main focus. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope he doesn’t just want to kick the books around like I did. 

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players like us could join the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He didn’t gather us and say, ‘This is your big chance,’ but we all knew it was. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids,’ which made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his words. 

I rely a lot on my close friends and family. However, having money can sometimes create problems. For example, people often ask me why I let my mother keep working. I have helped my parents financially; I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and I think they would be upset if they felt they should depend on me. My mom doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to help those around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think, and it doesn’t solve all my problems. 

After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can’t do that now because if I break a leg while skiing and can’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."""
24,"Text: 'Sam Carter was the reason we lived at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. My father was having a hard time writing there, so Sam offered to help us find a cheap place to live. The beach was usually empty because the sun was often covered by sea fogs. Reef Point did not attract many visitors. The road was not very inviting, and a nicer resort called La Carmella was nearby, so most people chose to go there instead. Only those who were broke or really loved surfing would come to Reef Point. 

But now, with the hot weather, many people were at the beach. After being alone for months, we were surrounded by activity. My father was busy trying to finish a script, and he was very stressed. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty started hanging around. I tried to send him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he didn’t really mean it. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, ‘Who does he belong to?’ My father replied, ‘He thinks we belong to him.’

Rusty loved the beach and liked to dig things up and bring them to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, and I had to return them. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim faster. We had been swimming that day. My father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, so Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. One surfer caught my attention. She was very skilled and made the others look clumsy. When she decided to stop, she rode in on a final wave.

“Hi,” she said, “why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“Do you mean ‘Tall as the Morning’?” I nodded. 
“I read that book from start to finish.” 

She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that people were friendly but only showed real interest when I mentioned my father’s book, 'Tall as the Morning.'”"

""What have I done?"" Violet Hetherington thought to herself. She was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line was spilling out of the area marked ‘Departures’, and no one was moving. Her friend Annie had told her, ""It's best to get to the docks late. If you arrive too early, you’ll just be waiting around."" Annie, who was married to a diplomat and had traveled a lot, usually gave good advice. But this time, she was wrong.

After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. The mood among the waiting passengers became tense. Some tried to stay patient, while others attempted to make jokes, but most people were unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and it was supposed to be a special experience. The fact that they couldn’t board the ship quickly made things worse. Violet felt like leaving. 

She reached into her bag for her phone but realized it was missing. This was more frustrating than the long wait. It made her feel like taking this cruise was a mistake. Now, without her phone, she couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it in the cab, because all the important numbers were saved in her phone. This was the kind of mistake her older son, Harry, always warned her about.

Behind her in the line was a friendly-looking couple. ""I’m sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make a quick call?"" Violet asked. She called Harry using their phone and left a message asking him to check with her neighbor, Kristina, to see if the phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, ""Thank goodness,"" but she didn’t tell Harry that. Harry believed he was more experienced than his mother, while her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes because he made them too. Dan might forget to pass the message to Kristina.

Eventually, the line started to move, and Violet reached a window where she handed over her travel documents and prepared to board. Her heart sank when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a cheap hotel trying too hard to impress. There were shiny fake wood panels, fancy chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets that looked like those in airports. 

Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’, which were covered in mirrors and filled with tired passengers. They might have preferred not to see their reflections after a long morning of travel. Violet was squeezed against the side of the lift as it moved up, stopping at each floor to let people out. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out and felt free. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to ensure she had a good view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures to include in a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer known for her amazing ability to capture interesting moments. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. 

One morning, Maloof looked around at all this and realized he was on the edge of something special, which happened by chance. “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,” Maloof said. “I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They reached out to families who had hired her as a nanny and spoke with people from the shop where she developed her film. 

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be a private person but had a unique personality. She always carried a camera with her and wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “I remember her as a private person but one who had strong opinions about movies and politics.” 

Maier was knowledgeable about theater and films. Although she was not very social, she would walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.” 

Maier’s work is a pure form of art; she did not create it for money. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. “What is interesting about Vivian is that she has so many captivating pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style or borrowed ideas from others. 

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. The funny thing is that he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I improved as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known and to get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it has not completely succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she seemed calm, especially for someone in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass. The official looked at it and asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men has come together to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded thoughtfully. “It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. There’s a family-like feeling at home; I received a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.” She also mentioned that it bothers her when people think her book is not a serious project.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in a spiral shape, where each part is half the length of the one before it. The story speeds up as it goes along. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she wanted to create a book with structural patterns that readers could notice if they wanted to, but that it wouldn’t matter if they didn’t.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Surprisingly, Catton said she did not know how the story would end when she started writing. “I would write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be to get out of that situation.” One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also discussed her love for television dramas, which often have cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would be interested in writing for TV. “That could be pretty cool,” she replied. She spoke with enthusiasm and laughed softly. She becomes animated when discussing her writing and New Zealand. “I notice that when I come to Britain, the landscape of my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for more populated areas to be around more people.” For now, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."

As a boy, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either making things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has been building steel-string acoustic guitars by hand. He says, “I am still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood create such a beautiful sound? Different types of wood make different sounds, and that still surprises me.”

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of getting a job to save money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood affect sound and how to put them together. The bass guitar was the first instrument he built from scratch, but he had been making model boats and planes with his brothers for a long time. His father taught them how to use tools like saws and chisels. Jonny had also been fixing instruments for his friends.

Although Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, he didn’t think about a career in guitar-making at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university because it involved design. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out because he felt it didn’t suit him. He realized that guitar-building is a form of sculpture that creates sound, and he thought it might be a better career than pure art since people actually use the guitars.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he worked part-time cleaning windows to earn extra money. He sold his first guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a skilled guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, he says he is “still scratching a living.” He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the early years, Jonny focused on getting known. He attended music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which was difficult for him. Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good. However, UK-made guitars are now recognized for their quality.

Jonny thinks that new instrument-makers should take courses to learn valuable techniques. However, he also believes that learning through trial and error is important. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and what doesn’t. He says, “If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you learn from someone else, you may only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, you learn everything.”"

When we talk about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a common tradition, and I will mention the famous saying by the 18th-century writer Dr. Johnson: ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This saying is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many people stop here or try to explain why the English are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They think that when we talk about the weather, we are really interested in it. 

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not interesting at all. He points out that in England, we do not have extreme weather events like tornadoes or blizzards, which are common in other places. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that while we may not have tropical storms, living near the ocean means we can never be sure what the weather will be like.

I believe that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather itself. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, when someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just polite greetings or ways to start a conversation.

In fact, talking about the weather is similar to how monkeys groom each other. They spend time grooming, even when they are clean, to bond socially. There are specific situations where we use weather talk. Some people think that English people talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. There are three main situations for weather talk: as a greeting, as a way to start a conversation, or as a topic to fill awkward silences. 

This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather a lot. A conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to more weather talk, and return to it when there is a pause. This can lead others to think that we are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall that is 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip, choosing it over more exciting tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt she did not have good answers. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to help her explain life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching for 31 years, Alice started her new career as an author in 2001. 

Alice felt that moving from teaching to writing was a big change. She said, “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very demanding. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not as tiring. My former colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my stories.” Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. She believes that much of the young adult fiction focuses on negative experiences, which, while well-written, can be very dark. On the other hand, there is also a lot of fantasy, like Harry Potter. Alice’s books are different from both.

In her teaching, Alice always linked English and History, often teaching about ancient Greece alongside the novel ""Tale of Troy."" She loves the moment when a child goes from being bored to being interested and then from not understanding to understanding. “I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to make them engaged,” she said. She sees her writing as a continuation of her teaching. 

Alice was inspired to write her first novel partly because she saw a gap in the market and partly because her two sons were leaving home, creating an ‘empty nest’ for her. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. “I had been teaching for 25 years, and I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I thought I didn’t need.” Before she could join the course, she had to send in her best piece of fiction, which she only learned a few days before the course started. “I sat down at the computer and quickly created a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.” After three hours and 30 pages, she submitted it and was accepted.

During the course, her classmates reviewed her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was very important in editing her novel. Alice said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I believe we work well together. He helps improve what I write – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if something isn’t working, he suggests different words. My instinct is to keep adding more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor.”"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to take part in a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. 

“I’m looking forward to it,” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I’ll be warm in the car.” Alistair, dressed in winter cycling gear, was also excited. “To be honest,” he said, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway up.”

The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would finish at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high. This would be easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill right from the beginning. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair quickly rode away on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and started driving. The big question was: who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence was shaken when, just 15 seconds into his drive, he encountered a giant tractor blocking the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he complained to the cameraman in his car. “If Alistair beats me, it’s all because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair struggled with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, passing walls and fences. Sheep watched curiously as he kept moving forward.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. With the sun shining and open land ahead, he began to pick up speed. Meanwhile, Jonny faced another challenge. The narrow roads in the villages of Yorkshire were not made for fast driving. He had to slow down to get around a very tight corner and then drove through a stream that had formed on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he raced straight towards the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard, and then suddenly had to brake as he reached the finish line. Looking around, he asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in celebration and shouted, “Yes!”

A few moments later, Jonny arrived in his car and stepped out. “Well done,” he said, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"
32,"Text: ""The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your own shot. The well-kept grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a calm atmosphere that helps you focus. The quiet of Centre Court is good for my game. What I struggle with the most during a match is to block out everything except the game itself and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by loud applause and cheers when a point ends. I hear the crowd, but it feels distant. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me closely or the millions watching around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not too hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer won easily, but my defeat in 2007 was much worse. I knew I could have played better; it was not my skill that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, who is usually tough on me, surprisingly told me there was no reason to cry and that there would be more chances at Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand; I felt this was my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment matters, but some moments are more important than others, and I had let a big one slip away in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to make me feel better. But he was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat; this time, my mindset would be strong. The best sign that I was ready was my belief that I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them to avoid the topic, but they understood that I was already focused on the match in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that focus was mine alone."""
33,"Text: In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for."" Her name was Jane Goodall, and she would spend most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, the National Geographic Society in Britain helped make her famous by publishing articles and making documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including popular children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her personal life rather than her work. 

Despite this, Jane Goodall is recognized for her important contributions to science. She has greatly advanced our understanding of chimpanzees, showing that they have complex social and emotional lives. Before her research, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools, and we did not realize that they share emotions similar to humans. Goodall's book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is considered the most important work in chimpanzee research. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is seen as one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans.

Even as a child, there were signs of the scientist she would become. In the autumn of 1939, when she was just five years old, Jane disappeared one day. The police and her family searched for her. After a long search, she returned, covered in straw. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had hidden in a henhouse and waited for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."

In our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voice of a playful 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to viewers of children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says, “so I had to learn how to say many medical terms quickly.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there is more to it. You need to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many well-known actors want to do voiceover work. Because of their fame, producers invite them to auditions, but often they don’t get the roles because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a standard acting career. During the course, she occasionally worked singing jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.”

Adult female actors often provide the voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter than those of male actors. There are complicated procedures and many forms to fill out when hiring child performers, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create different sounds and to avoid always sounding like the same child. She collects new voices by watching children’s TV. 

Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; working with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for work is strong, and a good showreel – a recording that shows what the artist can do – is very important. “It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her profession through hard work as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also thinks a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she performs. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll speak like that for hours, maybe even days,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in completely different voices.”"
35,"Text: ""People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many children dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these dreams and choose more practical careers, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can earn a living by drawing simple pictures, like those in high school notebooks, seems silly at first. Yet, some people do just that. 

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ‘the kid who draws.’ I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, and they bought them. In a few months, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. The barriers to becoming a cartoonist are low, but it is still a challenging job. You should only try to become a cartoonist if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have of making a living with your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I don’t refuse any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you may not want to do. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But those days are fading. For most people today, cartooning is like running a small business. This means you not only have to create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with this, the more successful you will be. 

I have seen cartoonists with average creativity and great business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack other skills. It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ circle it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it could actually be a lucky break!"""

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of old things, so why did I want to throw this one away? I took it to the dump and was about to leave it there when a young man came up to me, looking confused. “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” he asked. I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. After that day, I felt sad about my decision.

A few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I opened the email from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since the young man took it from me. Keith found my name on a label on the back of the guitar and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy I could have cried. I would have paid anything for it, but his price was very fair. I had forgotten that my dad always put name labels on my things, including my guitar. I could imagine how my dad would have laughed at this strange situation!

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar when I was young because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound bad when a beginner played it. But I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar, playing easier songs. This was also the time of punk music, when people who couldn’t play well could still be rock stars.

When I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are played that way. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands just knew what to do. My fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really meant for solo playing. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"

Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about sleep. When I wrote the book *Insomniac*, which is about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was one of the few warning others about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Many people who struggle with sleep understand how important it is. It is good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. There hasn’t been much talk about them. We often lose our dreams. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss out on the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. This is the stage of sleep where we have the most vivid and emotional dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. If a person lives to be 90 years old, they will spend around six or seven years in REM sleep. When researchers prevent people from having REM sleep, they find that the next night, people experience more REM sleep to make up for it. This suggests that dreams are important.

In 1953, researchers discovered REM sleep, and many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research showed that it was not that simple. The focus of dream studies changed from psychological reasons to physical ones. Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are significant. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as film is very dream-like. However, I wonder if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively?

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to create new associations. Dreams may help us discover new patterns and combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They come up with unexpected ideas that make sense in a unique way. This is what creativity is, according to Stickgold. 

I find that I write better after having intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely remember, seems to help me think more clearly. On those days, my thoughts and ideas come out quickly, and I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t know exactly how it works, but it does seem to help. Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and everyone needs their brains to work well. We all need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, which has a beautiful view of the sea, you see many empty frames on the walls, along with smiling photos of her two daughters. As a leading artist in the copyist art movement, Susie can easily recreate the beauty of early 20th-century impressionist paintings and 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. However, she doesn’t keep any of her own work. “As soon as I finish them, they go,” she says with a shrug. 

Susie is in high demand. Over her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted many famous artists' works, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions of pounds, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but for others, having a famous painting is about status. One celebrity likes to show off his “Van Gogh” painting, which is actually a “Susie Ray Van Gogh.” “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s up to them.” Some collectors keep the original in a bank safe and display Susie’s copy to save on insurance.

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she tries to make it look as real as possible because she believes it is important to respect the original artist. However, she always signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as the real thing is illegal, and even though she knows people who have done this for money, she has never been tempted. Those who make fakes often get into trouble. Susie admits she isn’t rich and has faced challenges, but her situation is better now, and she doesn’t want to risk her reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after earning her art degree. She worked for very little money for several years. Looking back, she sees that this experience helped her develop her skills and gave her a love for plants, even though it was hard to make a living. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets about that time but is happy to have found a more financially rewarding career.

When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to reach her level of skill. Her training allows her to create everything from drawings of plants to perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces and 20th-century abstract art, although she now focuses on French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas being her favorites. 

Susie mentions that many people think modern art is easy, almost like child’s play. However, she explains that impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very careful and detailed, which makes it challenging to get right. Given her skills, it seems surprising that Susie doesn’t create her own original art. Isn’t art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She believes her work is the result of years of training and hard work, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—fine, but not better than that. It’s like living on simple food after enjoying meals from a top chef. Susie is a perfectionist."

During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest on it. This passion started in her childhood. She had a special connection with the boats that took her around the world; they felt like one with her. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant. People would ask her about the race, but she quickly wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had almost defeated her.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher. This was her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial for her. She proudly displayed her unappealing stock of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical supplies. She took great care of her boat because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, and fragile thing with limited resources. A turning point for her was a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. This experience made her reflect and see things differently. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. She felt that humans often take what they want and move on without thinking.

When I arrived at Ellen’s office, she was finishing a busy conference call. She explained why we need to act now to save the planet. “Coal, oil, and gas are limited resources. We must find ways to use them wisely,” she said. Initially, her message was negative—telling people to use less—but she later found a more positive approach. Now, she talks about reusing materials, like industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, discussing our dependence on non-renewable resources with government and business leaders. “I may not be an expert,” she said, “but I love learning. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Compared to sailing, this feels more important. It’s about finding how my voice can help.”

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people rethink and design a sustainable future through business and education. “I miss the adventure of being at sea,” she admitted. “It’s part of who I am. At sea, you feel connected to everything. You don’t have time to feel lonely; you focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message is more complex than just saying, ‘I want to be the fastest around the world.’ I may have been the fastest, but this work is more meaningful than anything I’ve done before.”"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. He hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and explore, instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he becomes a teenager.

I spoke to several experienced climbers who have climbed Everest, and none of them thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the mountain. They believe that while a young climber might be strong, they might not be emotionally ready. They also doubt that a young person has enough experience to make good decisions while climbing safely. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can’t focus on it – we have a lot to do. I think about the risks, but I believe our experience as climbers will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""

I also wonder about Jordan’s reasons for wanting to climb. Is this just his father's dream? Paul says, ""This project isn’t about me wanting to be famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, ‘Why not do it now?’ We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it."" When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal.""

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is seen as a chance to break records. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This creates a problem for Jordan. Some people think that focusing too much on achievements can take away the fun of the challenge. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something impressive, like climbing Everest. Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I have just started a music degree, but my classmates know as little about classical music as most people our age. If you don’t know who created the music, you probably don’t own any of their recordings. This is sad for fans of classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only about 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. 

So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I like many styles, but my classical music listening is probably close to that 3% figure.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, can be hard for us. We prefer fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Also, pop music often talks about issues that matter to teenagers, while classical music does not.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that audiences at classical concerts have grown in recent years. Maybe, but I doubt many of those new audience members are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. 

I don’t know why more people enjoy classical concerts as they get older, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it. Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are excited to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it’s not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the other side of the car and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it looked confusing at first. Then she saw the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do that. 

A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not get it over with?” She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a large area for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, looking closely at each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. 

Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best of the lot!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” The horse’s name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. It can’t be far.” She was happy to find that the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. 

As she put the saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she finally sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in control of everything she could see. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I really mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling the rhythm of the movement and the breeze on her cheek. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"Text: ""I have met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up on stage in front of thousands of fans? ‘I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven,’ Cody says, remembering how it all began. ‘But I was swimming and surfing every day. Those activities were more important to me back then; I had a busy life. When I was 13 and in high school, I posted a few videos online.’ These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos. So Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The responses were amazing. 

Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on improving his sport. But then record labels contacted him, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the chance. ‘It was very hard for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 years old and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?’ He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. ‘It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,’ he says, remembering their shocked faces. ‘I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy world.’ 

So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family across the world, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and is not directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody believes it’s important to have a close group of good people around you to stay grounded. Of course, everyone has doubts. ‘Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, “How does my decision affect my little brother and sister?” My little brother is eight years old, and he travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,’ Cody admits. ‘I worry about how that affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.’ 

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big opportunity, even when it’s a little scary. ‘Everything happened so fast and unexpectedly,’ Cody says. ‘Now, I’m going to countries I never thought I’d visit and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s something many people dream of. But I know it won’t last forever.’"""

I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I had worked with most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing that I could handle the job. My grandfather didn’t seem to notice much. 

With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of dark water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and the dark water was followed by solid ice downstream. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t recognize him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from an expedition in South America. This chain is more special to me than having a famous grandfather, and only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have the diary he kept during that trip, which I read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen.

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom smiled as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his bedroom. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious from my wetsuit, and he had seen me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa can be difficult, and it’s been harder for me to ignore his temper lately. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hit me hard, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came in with a sympathetic smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I didn’t say that he had always been like this. But like my mom, I try to be understanding. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, along with his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own collection of trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, even though he is often grumpy. 

My mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even on these cold days!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Text: 'Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her into the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously unfinished. “Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” 

Jess looked closely at the painting. There was a river that took up most of the picture; it didn’t look like any river she knew, maybe it was just imaginary. The painting was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was very small, with just a hint of green that was easy to miss, drawing the eye into the pale water and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant scene. Still, she felt drawn to it, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed her excitement, even though she tried to sound casual. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: “River Boy.” The words felt strangely important to her, but she didn’t know why. 

Then she noticed something else. She looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” 

“Exactly. It’s strange, isn’t it? For him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later since he hasn’t finished it yet. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” 

“Mum! You should have known better.” 

“I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.” 

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa’s answer. “He told you it’s not the artist’s job to explain a painting because each picture has its own meaning, just like a poem, and we either understand it or we don’t. He said painting is hard work without having to explain it to everyone…” 

“Mum, he said ‘ignoramus.’” 

“… every ignoramus what it means. If artists had to explain their paintings to everyone who asked, they would never get any work done. And he said…” Mum interrupted her, laughing. “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.” 

“Inspire?” 

“Someone who gives an artist ideas.” Jess knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually said it to explain that the muse wasn’t helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a hard part to work on. He never said the muse was about her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. “He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He’s been painting all his life.”'"

This morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I’m not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn’t wake up thinking, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the moment, as things often do. Later, I wonder why I thought that, but by then it’s too late. This happens to me quite often. 

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. Now, I keep my collection of shells and fossils there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was excited when she gave it to me! 

The problem is, it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to fit in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it is the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is for Mum and Dad, the back one is my sister Angela’s, the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s, and my room is the size of a broom cupboard. Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. When Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be stuck in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. Then I thought, if I can’t cut anything off the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this “lateral thinking.” I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that’s exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel ‘The Borrowers’ tells the story of a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ‘borrow’ things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be difficult to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I wanted to avoid criticism from fans. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, which made filming more complicated.

One of the most important things was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be ten times further away than usual. To show the Borrowers' perspective, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. A big challenge was getting the shadows right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we did it.

The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with large objects to make the actors look small. It was very surreal. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really got into it. The coins were huge, bigger than dinner plates, and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much. In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t need to act.

Getting the costumes right was very important to me, and other directors have struggled with this in past TV versions. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they looked like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail with the costumes!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I made 2,000 drawings by the end. They weren’t perfect, but they worked. We didn’t have enough budget for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."

My mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there are none. I know that soon things will get crazy. There will be fake smiles, people pretending to be my friends, and requests for free concert tickets from my dad. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of touring and private tutors behind. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet real kids. I think it would be cool to meet someone whose mom works in an office or whose dad mows lawns. 

I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, looking unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary seems confused. “Oh,” she says and types my last name on her computer. That’s good because not many people recognize my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she replies. Then she hands me my schedule. English Literature is my first class. Great! I like English. But I will be late because it’s in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look lost. 

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the back of the class. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with flowers on them. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses and calls my name. “Desert... McGraw?” she says. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After explaining the books we will read this year, she lets us socialize! 

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few options. Should I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or should I tell the real reason my dad gave? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. It has energy, color, and culture.” Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a studio right by the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. Yes, it’s easier to lie. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out eventually, but I want to pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” She doesn’t seem to care much. That’s great."

Today, American teenage girls are expected to do a lot. They should be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in school. Being an average teenager is not enough anymore. Many people think that if teenagers do not have big ambitions, they are being lazy. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, says that adults often forget how much pressure teenagers face. They have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life. Even with these challenges, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist. Some people in the media describe teenagers as lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some of these traits may be true for a few, many believe it is unfair to label all teenagers this way.

Kristen Loose thinks that many people wrongly assume teenagers spend all their time on their phones and watching TV. She admits to having her phone nearby most of the time, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. For teenagers today, phones are tools that help them manage their lives. They need to be reachable and have access to information at all times, which can make it seem like they are addicted to their phones. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere, and schoolwork never really stops. 

Many teenagers wake up around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often stay up past midnight. Their days are filled with school, activities, family duties, and homework, leaving them with little time to sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of American teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. Additionally, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are too tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen believes that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, this is not a lot. She does not spend much of this time on social media or TV; instead, she focuses on volunteering. Lindamarie thinks that many people believe teenagers only care about themselves, but she enjoys helping others. She looks forward to making a positive impact in her school and community.

In the future, the stereotypes about teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these ideas and make a difference in the world. There will always be new generations of students who are ready to take on the world before they even finish school."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this small group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project that combines astronomy and adventure, which is likely why teenagers want to join. I joined them one weekend in late spring as they prepared to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and creates a bright trail of light.

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box were a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check temperature changes as the balloon rose. Two GPS trackers were placed on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank, donated by a supporter from another state, to inflate the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get the gas tank. “I didn’t really mind,” he said. For kids in this club, that’s normal.

Finally, it was time for lift-off. “Five, four, three, two, one,” they counted down, and the balloon began to rise. Some of them ran and followed its path with powerful flashlights until they could no longer see it in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder as the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at a sky so clear that it was hard to believe they were only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with around 4 million people. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” said one girl quietly. “I know,” whispered another. Suddenly, a meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, causing the balloon to expand until it was almost the size of a house. Then it popped with a loud bang. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recoveries are a big part of the program,” said the group’s leader, noting they had only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.”

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to reach it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students are familiar with the Eastern Sierra,” their leader said. “What seems wild and dangerous to some is just a normal part of life for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not capture any shooting stars. While this was a bit disappointing, it also gave them a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountains. It was just one more adventure to share with anyone who asked."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. Her interest began by chance when her younger brother was excited about dinosaurs, a phase many children go through. Although she initially dismissed it, she helped him with a science project and found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology that amazed her. She realized she wanted to pursue this field.

Chloe recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite being young. She felt nervous at first, worried he might think she was just an annoying kid. However, she felt more comfortable when he showed patience and listened to her questions.

When discussing how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows, Chloe expresses her frustration. She believes films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs but often misrepresent palaeontologists. They are usually portrayed as either eccentric geniuses or socially awkward people, which does not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explains that her job is very varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in laboratories to analyze fossils, and writing scientific papers. Although it is not her main job, she also believes it is important to communicate scientific findings to the public, especially young people. She wants to inspire children to learn about science, using dinosaurs as a way to spark their interest in the natural world.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, where she provided advice to ensure the dinosaurs were accurately portrayed. She found it easy to help because there were not many mistakes to correct. The documentary attracted viewers of all ages, showing that our understanding of dinosaurs has improved significantly compared to older films like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they represent the explorer in all of us. They capture our imagination and remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. She sees Palaeontology as a way to travel back in time."
52,"Text: ""I want to say this clearly: when you are traveling by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not ‘there yet,’ even if you keep asking, ‘Are we there yet?’ The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not ‘there’ anymore; it’s ‘here.’ So if you think you might be ‘there’ already, you should be asking, ‘Are we here yet?’ I’m sure no one wants to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear that question over and over on long car trips. 

Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You could watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the beautiful views outside the window. In the front seat, there’s a parent with juice boxes and cookies, adjusting the radio and temperature to keep everything running smoothly. 

But then, someone in the car does something annoying—usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he’s all over my space, and a fight starts. The driver and the other parent have to reach back to separate us while the car swerves. They tell Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a bit, and we can enjoy the beautiful scenery again.

Later, when I’m trying to read, I feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing his breath in my direction. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. This makes me angry. Tim gets yelled at again, and the car swerves more. Eventually, things calm down again.

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask, ‘Are we there yet?’ he often says, ‘Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.’ But we are still on the highway, going fast. Then he says, ‘Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.’ This keeps us quiet for a while. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults jump out of the car and move as far away from the kids as possible. So remember: if your parents are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you’re not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: “There is so much technology today. Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve screens. It’s natural for people to connect and communicate.”

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged until the end. This idea was improved in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players work together to win or lose as a team, which encourages more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, designed by North American Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the famous book. He remembers, “When I played that with friends, we felt scared and excited. In the end, everyone felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to create something like that.”

Leacock’s love for board games started when he was a child. He enjoyed receiving games as birthday gifts but often felt disappointed when they didn’t meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he began to redesign games to make them better. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up version improved game design even more. Leacock explains, “It has a lot of storytelling. It’s like a video game where you develop characters, get new rules, and the story changes.”

Interestingly, the growth of the video game industry has helped the success of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says, “Everyone plays mobile games now. Most people with smartphones have at least one game they enjoy.”

For a while, video games allowed some social interaction, like playing together at arcades or on the couch. However, as multiplayer games moved online, players became more distant from each other. This led some people to seek out ways to play games with others in person again. In John and Zuzi's busy café, it is clear that tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our online world, games are now something to be shared directly and physically, and this trend is likely to continue."

Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are very important in the music business, even if your career starts with many failures. He says his mother was an amazing singer who helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced his music taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the music room at school learning songs on the piano. He said, “I was doing well in tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for my whole life. It was just too much hard work.”

At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not want to pursue a music career. Jamie remembers going to his parents and telling them he wanted to be a musician. He had been writing lyrics during economics lessons and playing the piano every day while others were outside playing. His father gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Eventually, he became more successful as a songwriter than as a performer. After a tough time with a record label in the UK, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. However, he did not become famous right away. He said, “I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of my artist career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he found success. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists. He helps launch their careers.

Sometimes, he has to explain to the artists he works with that wanting to write popular songs is not something to be ashamed of. He asks them, “Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?” He believes they should aim to create songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he knows he has a talent for writing number one songs. Instead of trying to please others, he focuses on his goal. He says, “When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool; we want to write classic modern pop songs.”"

Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him if they don’t watch videos of people doing tricks on bikes. He is known as a ‘street trials cyclist.’ This means he jumps from difficult places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other tricky spots. These stunts are recorded and shared online.

On the day I interview him, we meet at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids all know who he is, and some older people come to greet him, calling him ‘an absolute legend.’ After watching him perform, I agree with them. At first, I was a bit doubtful, but I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him after his stunts, he seems uninterested and a bit sad. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not enjoy being a celebrity. He finds it hard to connect with fans. He understands the importance of talking to them, but he prefers to focus on doing his stunts.

This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that help create this content. He says, “This technology allows people like me to earn money.” Sometimes he feels that everyone is filming themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t fully agree with that. However, he is not complaining. Through his videos, he makes a good living from what used to be just a hobby for others.

After many years of interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two important things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent and help someone keep going even after failures. In risky sports, it is especially important to have mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy but new challenges. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He responds, “Those who criticize me may care, but they don’t understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t realize that I get advice from experts to reduce risks.” In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some never feel scared, and they shouldn’t be doing these sports. It’s important to know the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into two groups: those who can’t overcome fear and those who can. I belong to the group that feels fear but finds a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes I ride around for a while to get ready before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm just before I jump. If I fully commit, then I’m okay.”"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist that was attached to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 

Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. “The training was a shock,” Helen said. “I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!”

On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took her 15 minutes. “That was the scariest thing I’ve done,” she said afterwards. “I’m glad it’s over!” Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. He had already written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He says, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.” Jeff wanted a unique touring bike and decided to build one himself. He thought the most interesting bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made.

After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more amazed people were by his bike.

His worst experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to return home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using a new tool called a ‘night-vision scope’ that helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have decreased a lot, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but we don’t have information about their nighttime activities because we didn’t have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat.

Our work is challenging. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been difficult – some nights are warm, but most of the time it is rainy. It is also very quiet, so I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. I enjoy this challenge, especially when I think about the summer, when we will spend hours in a laboratory analyzing our results together. It will be hard to be indoors, but it is necessary. I wouldn’t change this experience for anything!"
59,"Text: ""When I tell people what my job is, they often can't believe it exists. But I’m serious! I spend my days at work tasting chocolate! Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure that customers receive high-quality chocolate from my company. Every week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate, from our factory. I need to check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for the chocolate. 

Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues! My kitchen is filled with machines and ingredients to experiment with. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel to buy raw materials, which can be hard because I have a young family. However, I enjoy the variety and lack of routine in my job, although I still love the chocolate the most!

People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"""
60,"Text: ""Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a center that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching balls, and even fire. It also teaches trapeze, where performers fly through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

In the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a career in the circus, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time. It’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Staying fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is essential, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always work on improving their skills. 

People often think that circus performers are likely to get injured or that they only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, though, that it’s not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also competitive, but it’s a lot of fun!”"

This means she sings in the background to support the main singer. Many people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers, but that is not true – they often have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry!

Mariam says, 'What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might even be a funny song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just do my job!'

'To do my work well, I need excellent musical skills and the ability to learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was very nervous because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough!'

'One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers sometimes do not know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.'"""

These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before deciding to sell satchels, Julie considered different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to make the right choice. When she chose satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie recalls, “Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never worked before but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. 

Although Julie didn’t know much about fashion blogs, they became important for her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew, along with the speed at which her company produced them. Now, Julie enjoys waiting to see which celebrity will be seen with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online ads, she uses the internet community for ideas on new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. 

There was a difficult time when another company copied Julie’s design to sell similar bags. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices – people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place.'"

She was a good swimmer, and her coach at the swimming club believed she could become a champion. However, the club was far from her home, making it hard for her to balance training with her schoolwork. 

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky thought this looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She later said it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so it was easy for her to attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. When she turned 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky explained, “For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement goes away, there’s no reason to continue. Fortunately, I found a new career.”

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. “We work with young people who have never enjoyed sports,” she said. “The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job of bringing young people together so they can be part of a larger group.” The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky mentioned, “Some people think celebrity support is not always good for a charity. They believe celebrities do it for their own benefit, which can distract from the charity's real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, there was always music in their home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, and she was so nervous that her teacher had to take her off the stage. This teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her gain confidence. After being in the club for a while, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term.

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many of the others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened.

Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join the company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a fantastic evening.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments because she feels she has more to express. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her music, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an incredible trip – a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. Luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was good, with calm seas. I was busy with work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry promised he would take care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After we arrived in Canada, we met the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast, and on our first morning, the only other creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t know. It was nice to forget about time and just enjoy the moment. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, when we fell asleep on the boats, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to share our adventures with everyone at home!"
66,"Text: ""My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to many of his games. You might think that watching so many matches would make me love basketball, but it did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was already two meters tall, even though I was not yet a teenager. My sports teacher noticed my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. The teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I found myself in a game against another school. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t too different for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""

After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see the city I had lived in my whole life from the perspective of tourists, and it felt like a new experience every time!

After I finished my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I researched what I needed to do, I found out that to get a license as a full-time tour guide, I had to learn a lot more than I had so far. All tour guides in Chicago must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules.

After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. There are many other important skills. You need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you must be able to handle unexpected situations, like if a place you planned to visit is closed or if the route changes. Tourists do not want to hear about problems; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour.

I need to ensure that visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know that these reviews are very important because good reviews attract more customers. That’s why it is essential to make tours fun and stress-free. For me, the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job mean that my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."""
68,"Text: ""My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would get along with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we had nothing to worry about. 

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of our day. Josie found it very hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their food made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, which was a bit small, but we chose to do that because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I think she might be a little annoyed with herself for not enjoying her time fully because she missed her friends too much. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I definitely will!"""
69,"Text: ""My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to people for their homes or gifts, but to many different customers. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and we sometimes provide flowers for businesses' advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle for a wedding, which was a lot of work, but I felt very proud of what we accomplished.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were buying for myself, I would choose only pink flowers because it’s my favorite color. However, I have to remember that my preferences are not always what customers want. Not all flowers are available all year, so I can’t always find what customers ask for.

I don’t enjoy arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price I can. When I return to the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then, we create flower arrangements and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and sometimes I have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much work, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the budget someone has. That’s what selling is about, and I wouldn’t want to do anything else!"""
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films, including many for kids on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized I wanted something more – the chance to talk about a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs and not make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can also see how many tickets we’ve sold online, so we don’t worry about empty seats anymore! There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us at the end how much they enjoyed the experience, it feels great. Our website has been very helpful, and we are now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local paper reviews. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as word of mouth – when people tell their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."
71,"Text: ""Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to improve my hobby, so I decided to start a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my way of seeing and photographing things. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they were taking color photos. Because of this, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up. However, I learned to trust my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for my age group, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and that I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my career choice."""
72,"Text: ""I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can take part in different activities that help you learn and challenge yourself. There are levels from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ run the programs. When you finish each level, you receive a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I started to enjoy spending time at the children’s club much more than just getting the certificate. After I finished the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had made good friendships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, which means working with children. I had never thought about this job before joining the club. This experience has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!"""
73,"Text: ""I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly fell in love with the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for competing and winning has grown as I’ve gotten older, which helps me push myself more. I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I actually started. That achievement made me trust my abilities more. 

In the summer, I focus on training and my studies when there’s no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends during this time. It helps me cope with not being able to do what I love and what I’m good at. I need to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I also think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is possible if my active life allows time for college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."""
74,"Text: ""When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only get it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am grateful to my parents for making me do that because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try that. I never thought it would be so easy, as it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to know if they would be popular with other people. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my items to take home. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but we were just two people at a market stall! That was when I realized it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far."""
75,"Text: 'When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, “Because my father’s job made us move around the country a lot, I learned how to make new friends easily. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, adjusts to a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I am an only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.” 

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to spend her time this way. The year before, she had entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. This is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was available in bookstores. 

One review of Being Amelia notes that, even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer mentions that, although Janine is still very young and her novel is not very long, she has shown that she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors. Janine is still adjusting to being a famous writer: “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I will soon have something interesting to write about!”'"
76,"Text: ""My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy to get this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school nearby.

After we moved, we quickly adjusted to life on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment in it is nice. In the summer, the island is lively with many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live here, but there are not many teenagers, which I had hoped for. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which can be hard work.

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I will miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! However, we often see amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then it can become sunny again within hours, which still surprises me even after living here for a while. We do have terrible storms sometimes, and I wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But then I remember it has been here for hundreds of years and is still standing!"""
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After returning home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am close to achieving that. During family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries as well. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! 

I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I walked onto the stage, but I knew what to say and had some notes to help me. I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year!

I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in areas with lots of green spaces. I believe that birdwatching clubs should try to attract more young people to this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."

My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they thought I would do the same with football. But that never happened. I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked my skills, and I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13 years old. I improved a lot after that. Still, some people were not sure I would become a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in my abilities. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I thought I would! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with a large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to meet other players from my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and encourage them to believe they can play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times, but also some bad times. I’ve had very few bad times, though, so I feel lucky!"""

In recent years, there has been an interesting change in further and higher education in the UK and around the world. More and more, students are being encouraged to get involved in research early in their studies. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists, but is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are important not only for your studies but also for your future job, as they help you think about the world and how to do your work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge starts with asking questions instead of just accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, views, or beliefs we are given? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex and groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes in knowledge. However, research can also start from simple questions and everyday inquiries. This type of research involves careful work, asking thoughtful questions about issues, and making practical suggestions.

Most students have always done some form of research. You have likely conducted research for school projects or answered questions at work since you started. You have asked questions that led you to investigate topics, whether it was about where to go on holiday, how to grow plants, or how to fix things at home. In college and higher education, it is expected that you will have an enquiring mind, identify problems, critically explore information, and create your own knowledge to contribute to discussions.

Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. In these places, students learn by listening to teachers and texts without questioning them. It may feel disrespectful to challenge established knowledge or authority. However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.

This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students and professionals, but we must not just repeat what we read as if it is always true. We need to engage with the information, think critically about it, and check if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should avoid blindly accepting facts and information from our readings or conversations."

Cities have always been important places for ideas and creativity. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were popular spots where people discussed science and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artists like Pablo Picasso talked about art. However, living in a city can be challenging. The same cafés that encouraged discussions also helped spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 

Today, cities are known for their creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming and unnatural. Recent studies show that city life can actually make it harder for us to think clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in cities. Research has shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains relax and improve our thinking.

For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in rural areas. Instead of being in open spaces, we are often surrounded by many strangers in crowded places. This unnatural environment can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. For example, when walking down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and confusing street layouts. These small tasks can tire us out because cities are full of distractions that require us to constantly focus.

This idea is explained by attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our attention. Natural environments have things that naturally attract our focus without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. When we are in nature, our minds can relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to bring nature into urban areas. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a break from city life. A well-designed park can help our brains function better in just a few minutes. While people have tried many methods to improve mental performance, such as energy drinks or office redesigns, nothing seems to work as well as simply taking a walk in nature.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same crowded features of cities that can hurt our attention and memory also encourage innovation. The close social interactions in cities are key to their creativity. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, helps it thrive as a center for technology. On the other hand, less crowded areas may produce fewer new ideas over time.

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city living while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, there comes a time when someone might say, ""I'm tired of nature; take me to the city!"""

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe that studying the mind should not be limited to just what is inside our bodies. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as our brain cells, play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, items like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, what is outside our heads might also be part of our minds. It is easy to connect the mind with the brain because most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually use. This makes sense for neuroscientists who need to use brain-scanning machines. However, this often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. 

I do not want to deny that our brain is important for thinking, but I want to highlight that the mind is more than just the brain. It is better to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects can become extensions of our thinking or be used by our bodies, like when we make symbols from clay or use a stone to create a tool. It also examines how these interactions have changed over time and what these changes mean for our thinking.

This approach gives us new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of the role of objects in our thinking. For example, think of a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be linked, and it illustrates the flexibility of the human mind. By using the stick, the blind person can turn touch into a form of sight, and the stick itself plays an important role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body.

The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can change significantly by using new technologies. I see the human mind as a work in progress, always evolving. It is important to remember that whatever form the “stick” has taken throughout history—whether it is a simple stone tool or a modern smartphone—its main purpose is to connect us to the world, not to separate us from it. 

For humans, “sticks” are tools we use to satisfy our curiosity. This special ability to engage with objects explains why humans create things more than any other species, and how these creations shape our minds. I call this idea metaplasticity, meaning our minds can change and develop as they interact with the material world. I want to emphasize the importance of material objects in understanding the mind. MET provides a new way to see how different types of objects, from ancient tools to modern devices, have helped define and change who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, it is important to realize that humans have been using such technology since the beginning of our existence."
82,"Text: ""Few inventions have changed our way of understanding the world as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of culture at all levels – from practical and scientific uses to industrial and artistic ones, as well as entertainment. Historians argue that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. No other art form has had such a significant impact from the US. This claim shows that photography has become central to American culture, and to understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so appealing? First, photography was a mechanical process that matched the growing interest in technology, reflecting a national attitude that accepted change. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes in an exciting way. Second, the camera became a popular tool for representing oneself, allowing people to create images for public viewing in a society where personal and national identities were constantly being formed and reformed. Third, the camera has been important for families, providing a way to keep a record of their lives, even if that record is somewhat idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the trend towards realism in the work of US artists.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they are records of events, people, or things, which gives them a sense of objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by a person, it also carries a personal point of view. We might look at a photograph and think we understand its meaning, leading to the idea that photography is a 'universal language.' But the meaning of a photograph is more complicated than that. Few subjects – whether a person, object, or event – have their own clear meaning, and every image comes with some context that shapes our understanding of it, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery.

To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and function in its cultural context: Why did the photographer take the picture? How did people first see it? Additionally, the same image can be viewed in different places and times, changing its meaning each time. While the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized for a long time, it is now clear. In recent decades, starting with artist Andy Warhol's use of photographs in his work, many artists have included photographs in various ways. In summary, photography has become an essential part of art, complementing painting and shaping our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."""
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, which gives us some understanding of what this means. Although we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it is still a complex idea. James focused mainly on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and a way to understand these elements. Our knowledge about these things is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not be influenced by scientific facts.

Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in different situations. Psychologists help us separate subjective thoughts, which can be biased, from objective facts.

Psychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind and brain. While psychologists study the brain, they do not yet fully understand how it works in relation to our hopes, fears, and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not easily observable. We can only understand them indirectly through behavior.

Studying psychology is similar to solving a crossword puzzle. It requires evaluating and interpreting clues, which must come from careful observation and accurate measurement. These observations need to be analyzed rigorously and interpreted logically. Psychology often involves complex interactions, and understanding them requires advanced techniques and theories. Like any other science, psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to influence the processes it studies. Achieving these goals can help us understand our experiences and apply this knowledge to improve people's lives.

Psychological findings have been useful in many areas, such as improving teaching methods, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been studied scientifically for the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to answer psychological questions. They aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today. However, introspection has limitations, as noted by Sir Francis Galton, who said it only allows us to see a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than on their own experiences."
84,"In a storehouse in a regular business park in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays products that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own story of disappointment for the designers and marketers involved. 

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a successful business. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products, showing how uncomfortable they are with failure. The museum was started by Robert McMath, who originally wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. He began collecting every new item he could find in the 1960s. He soon realized a key truth: most products fail. By collecting all kinds of products, he ended up with mostly unsuccessful ones.

Today’s positive culture may contribute to the products in the museum. Many products likely went through meetings where no one recognized their potential failure. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into a failing product to save face. There is often little effort to understand why these products failed, and people involved may choose to forget about it.

This focus on optimism is also common in the self-help industry. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which suggests that imagining good outcomes can help make them happen. Research by neuroscientist Tali Sharot shows that a healthy mind may be inclined to see positive outcomes as more likely than they actually are. Her studies suggest that well-adjusted people often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events compared to those who are depressed.

However, how effective are these positive thoughts about the future? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied this question. Their findings are surprising: thinking too much about how well things could go can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For example, people who were encouraged to imagine having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our experiences with failure depend on our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think that ability can develop through effort and challenges. Fixed-mindset individuals find failure very frightening because it shows they did not meet expectations. For instance, a talented athlete who believes they are naturally gifted may not practice enough to reach their full potential. In contrast, growth-mindset individuals see failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being challenged. Overall, having a growth mindset is a healthier way to approach life, regardless of whether it leads to success."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they understand it, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are making us rethink home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to discover what helps players perform their best, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

This raises a question for fans. Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games in the Far East to reach more fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often think that the order of events explains what happens. For example, when a team attacks, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the many times when their cheering did not lead to success.

However, there is one common belief among fans that is supported by scientific evidence. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a well-known experiment, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another group watched the same match in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team than those who watched in silence. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers concluded that referees try to avoid extra stress from making calls against the home team.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change could be travel. In the past, traveling was difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and if their hotel is not good enough, the club will find them a better one. Stadiums used to be very different from each other, but now many top stadiums look similar and lack character.

Despite these explanations, none fully explains the data. Home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual matchups between the batter and pitcher. In team sports like basketball, winning depends on teamwork, which builds confidence when playing at home.

Another possibility relates to the players' emotions. Researchers found that players’ testosterone levels were normal before away games but increased by up to 67% before home games. This feeling of defending their home may connect to a basic instinct to protect their territory. In recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams playing at home won against stronger opponents, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is popular among many dedicated athletes and their coaches. The reason for its popularity is clear. First, there is some debate about who originally said it, as many golfers from that time have been suggested. Second, the meaning of the quote is not straightforward. Player did not mean luck in a literal sense; he was being ironic. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ 

However, there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, relates to the nature-nurture debate. This debate discusses whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice. It is not really a balanced debate; nurture (the influence of environment and practice) has clearly won. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent in sports, music, business, and other areas comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in any field. This theory has been popularized in books like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers and others with titles like Talent Is Overrated and Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice. These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor, suggesting that ‘10,000 hours is both necessary and enough to make anyone an expert in anything.’

However, as Epstein discusses in his interesting book, this idea is often not true. He points out a major problem in much of the research on excellence: it usually focuses only on successful people. He asks if there are better ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate natural talent from what is learned through environment, support, and hard work. Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden and the Caribbean to the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the success of sled dogs in tough races may depend on their drive and desire, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary.

This raises the question: can determination and commitment be chosen, or are they influenced by genetics? Epstein believes that the topic is complex. He makes a distinction between ‘hardware’ (nature) and ‘software’ (nurture), and he agrees that both are important for elite athletes. He does not ignore the role of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, Epstein also looks at cases where genetics play a significant role that cannot be overlooked. He also discusses important issues like race and gender. He asks: ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""

A recent international report shows that many children living in rich, industrialized countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, *Kith*, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens like televisions and computers, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main problem.

A follow-up study interviewed some children to understand their feelings better. The study found that many children do not wish for the latest technology; instead, they said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, saying they enjoyed long summer days exploring, swimming, and building forts. They think this was much better and healthier than the lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they are the ones who created a safer environment for their kids, which means no building forts in old sheds because of safety concerns.

Griffiths’ book has many strong arguments. She discusses how the fear of dangers outside makes parents keep their children at home, which benefits the toy and gadget industry that sells entertainment for kids stuck indoors. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or requiring kids to wear goggles during playground games. While it’s unclear how common these rules are, Griffiths expresses her anger about them in a powerful way. She also talks about other important topics related to childhood, like fairy tales and school rules.

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas and ignores important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares how children are treated today to a form of racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths has a romantic view of children, believing they are naturally good and creative. While she acknowledges that children can be mischievous, she mostly presents an idealized view of them that may not match reality.

One of the main ideas in the book is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Additionally, not all children want to explore the wild as Griffiths suggests. What about the shy, quiet children who prefer to stay at home? Perhaps the real issue is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too hard to explore."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill does not come only from my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences often happen through play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those that have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores, like lions, play more than herbivores, like cows, because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates, like monkeys, play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are allowed to.

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling emotions. Creativity is essential for success in today’s world. We no longer need people who just follow instructions or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce.

However, we cannot teach creativity directly. Schooling can sometimes take away creativity by focusing on fixed questions and answers. More importantly, children need to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children naturally want to play with each other, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which are important for their future.

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop at any time. If they cannot quit, it is not play. Players understand that to keep the game fun, they must make sure everyone is happy. This freedom makes play a very democratic activity.

Unfortunately, school has become more difficult. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. Supervised playdates have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults often feel they need to step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact over time. They are caused by various social factors, including parents' fears, warnings from experts about dangers, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend that has developed over the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore freely so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is much easier than the old way of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher chance of making mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. But the executive was upset by the request. She felt it was wrong to share her contacts with someone she didn’t know. Instead of just rejecting his request, she sent a harsh and sarcastic message that became very popular online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret how she handled the situation. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could actually help them.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. Ironically, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and create a different image of themselves. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. With the right pictures and songs on Facebook, you could seem like a more interesting person overnight. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. Some young people do not see this difference clearly. They may still think that being bold and confident online is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual in their messages and come across as arrogant. This reinforces the idea that young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing some research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of getting a helpful response. Avoid sending generic emails, and keep your tone respectful to leave a good impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it needs to be used carefully to avoid closing doors."
90,"Text: ""Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by one-third to one-half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of Americans, down from 45% in 2001. Many people confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were finished and that newspapers would become the most important source of news. Yet, theatre survived not only newspapers but also cinema and television. Radio has continued to thrive even in the age of TV, and cinema has remained popular despite the rise of videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008. 

Newspapers were once considered new media, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This change happened because producing timely news for a large audience became possible and affordable in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railways, and the telegraph. It was also important that people began to understand that everything around them was constantly changing, and they needed regular updates. This idea was not common in medieval times, when people mainly noticed the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life was seen as a cycle, with repeating events. 

Before the 19th century, journalism as a profession was not well established, and there was no clear need for people to receive news regularly. In some ways, the regular publication of newspapers can be a limitation. Online news allows readers to choose when to read based on the urgency of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms help us customize the news to fit our interests. When important news happens, online news providers can give updates almost instantly. There are no space limits that restrict storytelling or analysis, and readers can often access full documents or events mentioned in news stories. This is very different from the limitations of newspapers. 

However, many news providers do not seem to recognize the potential of the internet to improve understanding. Instead, they focus on being the first to report news, increasing reader comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In medieval times, news was often shared in busy marketplaces or taverns, where truth competed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be returning to that situation. Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works. They may be facing extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic world, newspapers will find a way to help us gain wisdom and understanding."""

If humans were truly comfortable under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, just like many animals that thrive at night. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genes, even if we don’t often think about being daytime beings, just like we don’t think about being primates or mammals. But this is the only way to understand what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also leads to problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 

Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and patterns that many living things, including us, have adapted to. Wherever human-made light spreads into nature, it affects important life activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lights, and there were no public gas lights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. 

We have brightened the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. There are many nocturnal species among mammals. Light is a strong biological force that attracts many species. The effect is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by searchlights or gas flares, circling until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours because of artificial light. 

It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. While most of us may not need a perfect view of the night sky for our work, we still need darkness like other creatures do. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is just as important for our health as light is; changing our internal clock can lead to health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological reflection of the light changes on Earth. These patterns are so important to our existence that disrupting them is like changing our center of gravity. 

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own bright world, we have disconnected ourselves from our natural and cultural history – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the scale of our existence, which is best understood against the backdrop of a dark night with the Milky Way shining above us."

The founder of a large international company recently said that his business will no longer track how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from a smaller internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change seems like an attempt to make the policy seem friendlier, even though it might not be very generous.

Is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, such as finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads and can judge if their absence would hurt the business. The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel sure that their team is up to date on projects and that their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more waiting when you return. 

If employees follow these guidelines, they might not take any leave at all, or they could feel guilty about taking time off. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers do not take enough leave, it could lower productivity over time. There may also be pressure from colleagues and gossip about who is off work and for how long. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a place with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. 

If the security and rights that come with statutory leave are removed, workers might feel they cannot take the time off they need for fear of being seen as lazy. They would lose their legal rights to rely on. This policy could create a situation where employees do not feel they can take their entitled leave, or they might still use their legal rights as a guide, making the new policy useless. 

Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which makes it hard to separate work from personal time. The internet company started its unlimited leave policy when employees asked how this new way of working could fit with the old time-off policy. If the company cannot track how much time employees work, why should it have a different standard for time off? 

However, a problem with having no set working hours is that all hours could become working hours. Employees might never know if their working hours are being watched by their employer, which could lead them to self-discipline in unhealthy ways. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid annual leave because rest and leisure are important for their mental and physical health. The benefits of increased morale, creativity, and productivity that the unlimited leave policy aims for can happen without sacrificing worker well-being. Therefore, I am not sure if allowing employees to ""take as much holiday as they want"" is truly the goal or likely result of this policy."

Peer review is the process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. Many scientists believe it is important because it helps prevent the publication of poor-quality papers. However, this process can delay publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure the quality of published research? The answer is both yes and no. 

I still believe in peer review, but I see changes happening in scientific publishing. One important change is the use of preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they have been peer-reviewed. This allows researchers to share new findings quickly so that others can read and discuss them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which can affect the motivations of authors and reviewers. The competition to publish in top journals can lead scientists to produce excellent work, but it can also encourage them to cut corners. Reviewers may focus more on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, the decision can depend on how interesting or newsworthy the research is, rather than just its scientific merit.

Many people know about these problems, but few are willing to change the current system. However, some experts, like biologist Ron Vale, believe that preprints could help solve these issues without completely changing the way things are done. Although preprints have been around for twenty years, they are not widely accepted yet. This is partly because many scientists believe that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.

Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors know that their work will be open to feedback and discussion from a global community of researchers. For example, psychology professor Tanya Elks shared her experience with a preprint. She wrote a critique of another published paper, which is often difficult to do in traditional journals. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond to her critique, and all comments were available for everyone to see. This way, readers can judge the quality of the arguments themselves. 

Preprint archives allow for informal scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also provide a place to share negative results, which are often ignored by journals that focus only on new discoveries. Additionally, papers on preprint archives are read and cited more often, showing that sharing research this way is effective. By using the internet's openness and encouraging collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the research itself, rather than where it is published."

When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" Their answers usually do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. The first paragraph was a scientific description, and the second was from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The object? An oxygen mask – an unusual choice that helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and helpful discussions.

When I was in school, poetry often confused me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand and feel. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we hope to find in poems? Isn’t a poem a place for deep feelings, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp humor? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp criticism, we read online articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, nothing can compare to the beauty of lyrics, instruments, and melody.

However, one useful thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life is full of uncertainty, unlike reading sentence by sentence. But these thoughts still don’t explain what a poem really is. If you search online for ""poem,"" it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as ""a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language."" This sounds nice, but it doesn’t explain the word’s origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who ""makes things."" So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it?

Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – carefully designed and exact – depending on their views. But these comparisons often break down when examined closely. The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both. It can help us rethink our usual ways of thinking and see ordinary things in a new way.

A poem as a mental object is easy to understand, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody has a strong effect, going back to schoolyard rhymes like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, right in front of you: A poem can touch you like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. 

What about all the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten just like an article, story, or novel, but it is not usually made to be sold. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not just a product for the market; it exists for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."

I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and I could have spent it on something useful for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered brought me joy. I have always enjoyed feeling connected to the past. 

After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again. It was a dull February afternoon, and I had a couple of hours to spare. I had a place in mind, but it was raining, so I decided to go to a nearby spot that I knew had old farming machinery. 

When my detector first beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then, it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t walk away without checking. I dug down about half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned it, I realized it was a beautiful, patterned loop. I stopped and stared, remembering the Great Torc I had seen in the British Museum. It is a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a twisted necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I was holding.

I took it to my car and kept looking at it on the way home. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first time it had been cleaned in centuries. “Marion!” I shouted, “I have something for you.” When she came into the room, she stopped and asked, “What is it?” I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were afraid of damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. Even though we had never been robbed, I felt anxious. Later, I got up and hid it under a floorboard in my office.

The law says that I must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, stopped talking, and looked at it. The torc was confirmed as authentic and was eventually sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

But the torc means more to me than just money. I feel like I have saved it for the nation. People often ask me, “Now that you found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?” But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I won’t stop looking for more treasures."

When my friends share stories about their carefully planned trips, where every moment is filled with activities like visiting museums or hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans often include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in comfortable beds? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours – more than 12 – I spent sleeping each day. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and enjoyably. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I think there is more to travel sleep than just relaxing. I believe that sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. All this new information fills us up – different cultures, music, landscapes, and ways of moving. When we sleep, we process this flood of new experiences. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are traveling. Sleep also changes in different places. People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to the island’s different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived. I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new Dominican friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and the conversation faded away. One by one, my friends left the table to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why they had so many pillows on the floor. I took some for myself and followed their lead. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life. Travel sleep has another great quality: I remember it. Away from my usual sleep routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep in a new place. If the idea of ‘slow travel’ – enjoying every moment instead of rushing around – is what makes a modern traveler aware, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is, in fact, an important part of the experience."""
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. “What do you think? Be honest.” Mia picked up a medium-sized hat that was soft and had a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said to her customer, trying to be diplomatic. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that made her look like a bulldog. “But it’s so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will make me stand out.” She sighed and touched the red and black miniature top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” 

Mia knew she couldn’t change the woman’s mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at her daughter’s wedding. Mia then thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since they had all been together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie, whom they didn’t know much about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia’s husband, Jeff, had quickly reacted. “Tattie? What kind of name is that?” he had said. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “More like something very pretentious,” Jeff had responded. 

Jeff didn’t like anything that seemed showy. He also didn’t understand Mia’s way of being polite and not saying exactly what she thought. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The problem with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite for your own good.” 

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered through the back door of Medlar House. Her commute from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to turn the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. But Mia knew from her friends that many women struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where she created a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. She let customers try on as many hats as they needed to find the right one. She encouraged them to bring their outfits to make sure everything matched. Recently, she had also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."

It is a long journey from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident but seems surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly starting a new career. Even though he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still figuring out what his new position involves.

The idea that a 21-year-old beginner from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports is surprising. However, Lawrence is known for proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on training for the discus instead, after previously playing rugby. Within 20 months of starting, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower.

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in American football, he says, “It was in the back of my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school in London, but it seemed like a crazy idea at the time. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played before, he felt confident enough to apply for the trials. 

When asked if he was nervous about competing against experienced players, he replied, “Not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.” Although he is not very talkative, he is sure of his abilities. His performance in various tests showed that he was the most impressive player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he said, showing a rare moment of pride.

However, he is also cautious. He has no experience in American football, so how can he make it onto an NFL team? He says, “Coaches have told me I have the right skills. It’s all about how hard I work.” When asked if he will be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected, he said, “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will definitely be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness may come from his disappointing experience in the Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that moment and is proud that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he said. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought that he had let the experience affect him negatively. Lawrence does not want to comment on that. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, which is a strong motivation. So, Lawrence has moved from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talent, wouldn’t it be better for him to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replied. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"Text: 'We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty land below, the dark shades of brown and green made me feel better. Even though it was mid-September, it had not yet started to change in Siberia. I could see no signs of people, just a strange view of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow flying to the far reaches of civilization to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I managed to tell him that I was going to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. “But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I explained that I believed there was a road, even if not many people used it these days. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend called Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to convince him by using hand gestures to show that I had a lot of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. In reality, I was not sure they would be good enough. This was especially true for my large postman’s over-trousers that I had bought for £10. 

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was speaking on and on. I was thinking hard about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. “OK,” it said. 

It was six years later that I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and sometimes fulfilling, plus there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was certainly his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an amazing adventure, proving that he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was showing the doubters that he could do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive.'"

In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate in this race. 

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form confirmed that I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. “The horizon is your best friend,” the pilot told me, “and I will guide you on where to look.” I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was told not to touch anything. As we were getting ready to take off, I was nervous. I had to keep my legs up, my feet away from the important steering pedals, and my hands away from the many switches nearby. I decided that I would not relax and enjoy the flight, even though I knew I needed to stay calm and focused to survive the experience.

When we started speeding down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and just two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out and made another sharp left turn, diving down. 

We were now just 10 meters above the ground, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, and I felt a rush of excitement, but then we made a quick right turn. I hadn’t even done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, but my hand was shaking so much that the plane shook too. 

Then Dario said something, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, turning the plane completely upside down. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. 

I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy roller coasters. However, I thought it was too much for me. At the top of the loop, while we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields below us. The flight lasted 10 minutes, and it felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during the race. 

As soon as we landed, Dario took out some sandwiches and happily started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about doing loops in the air."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been impressed by videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He says his ideal temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to make a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up taking the crew to different locations, and after 48 hours, I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater,"" he explains. He is now a well-known cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series. 

""I started at a good time. When I began, very few people had been to Antarctica. There were people who focused on coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became known as the cold man. It felt like there were so many amazing moments waiting to be filmed."" The camera and communication technology were very basic when he started 35 years ago. ""It is much easier to film today. Back then, if you shot something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much footage.""

""My experience in cold conditions is valuable. I know how to handle it. I have spent so much time on sea ice that it feels as easy as crossing the street. I do get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes."" Allan says that wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify the birds.

Recently, Allan got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would not be easy. It is a place for polar bears and is only for the bravest or most foolish. In April, it is usually -32°C, the wind is strong, and carrying cameras through deep snow is very difficult. After walking for five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on day 24, he felt like he was in the world of bears, moving at their speed and sensing like them. 

""We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch, and run to stay warm. After five hours of watching, suddenly I see something so quick that I almost miss it. But the camera is focused on the hole, and my eye is on the viewfinder. Nothing happens for a couple of seconds, and then I see a black nose. The nose becomes a muzzle, then a full head, and in less than a minute, she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She looks at me but is not scared. I pull back from a close-up, thinking it can't get better, when she slides down the slope. I believe she is enjoying it,"" he recalls, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ""Clearly, it’s their first view of the world. It’s showtime on the slopes, and we have front-row seats.""

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and see its effects firsthand. He believes he could create an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold water and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even bigger adventure. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. This time, however, there is much more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole to measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important for scientists. This research will show how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar regions.

Pen was prepared for this work from a young age. His father’s old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, helped toughen him up. She would send him out into the Scottish mountains during storms with very few clothes. His father also inspired his love for adventure, and Pen developed great physical strength. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and shares his passion for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home. She once raced against him in a mountain event and finished an hour ahead of him. 

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He finds it harder to be away from them this time. When he last left, his son was only one year old, and he made a mistake in saying goodbye. He told his son to take care of his mother and sister, which put too much pressure on the boy. This time, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while he is in the Arctic because he believes that calling them will remind them of how far away he is. 

In the days before he leaves, he is carefully preparing his equipment. He knows that once he is on the ice, it will be very difficult to fix anything. He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support team of six people who will fly in supplies. Pen feels that being part of a team can be stressful for him, and he is also worried about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He admits that he has been busy with planning and is concerned about what he will be able to do.

Pen believes that his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge, just like explorers in the past. He says that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, the data they collect will help scientists and engage more people in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He feels that their unique skills are now very important and useful to society again."
103,"Text: ""I took a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Although I enjoyed these activities, I felt there was nothing competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape so I could compete for an Olympic spot if I felt inspired again. So, I signed up for marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle’s invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000, which is a lot of money. We thought we had a better chance than most, but it would still require effort to secure it. Besides the race costs, I also had to think about the money I would lose by being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It feels good that people are interested. However, I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without having a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just talk about what I did before; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My preparation for the Olympics was tough, and my life was focused on getting in the best shape; but looking back, it was quite simple. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training program was organized, and there were doctors and dieticians. I was worried about how people would react to me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, and I could have chosen a better partner to win the race. However, my worries faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and lived on a deserted island for a year. But he couldn’t row well. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more understanding, but I felt it was important to tell Ben how much he needed to improve. I should have realized that this was his level when I agreed to race with him."""

Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, maybe because I was tired of the busy life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They offered me a job as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the snow and ice, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic location with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but I needed to know what I was getting into. ""The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical,"" they said. I started packing right away.

November 6, London

On my flight, I stared at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. I remembered that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. But now, I saw winter moving south, and the rivers were freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta

The bus ride north was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. ""Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?"" Anna asked. It was a rhetorical question. I followed the sound of barking, which grew louder as I reached the dogsheds. Three people were running back and forth, pulling the huskies out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs were very excited, straining against their ropes. I could barely introduce myself, but the others were too busy to talk. I stood to the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone waved at me impatiently, saying, ""Get in!"" I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and suddenly we were off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

November 15, Hetta

It didn’t take long for me to become part of the husky guides, but first, I faced a tough questioning about what I could do for the group. ""Are you useful?"" Anna asked. I was confused. I didn’t know. Further questions showed that I was not very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. ""You do have a driving license?"" someone asked finally. I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, no matter what, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seemed complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing conditions. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head was full of instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,"" I emailed my friends. ""In the snow."""
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. They noted that her time was fast enough to qualify for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special natural treatment called emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had suggested to help Radcliffe recover from an injury caused by an accident when she ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe said that the achievement didn’t fully hit her at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a significant moment, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. She and her team had decided not to set any limits on their goals, following the motto: no limits.

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could maintain her fast pace, fearing she might have to drop out. Hartmann was upset by this concern, although he understood that someone who didn’t know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so quickly. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to calculate her finish time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. After running 41 kilometers at a fast speed, she managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, “I can run faster than that.” She remembered the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a long time, and she thought, “I will come back and do it next year.” Unfortunately, that did not happen.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked closely with Radcliffe for weeks, providing daily training sessions to help her manage the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, “I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle the level of pain she could. She would push me to my limits.” Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, “Gerard, you’re 15 minutes late, Paula’s waiting.” There was no time for small talk; Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour training session. “Paula would get everything out of you. That’s what made her so good.” 

During this time, Hartmann dedicated so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became unhappy. When asked if she knew why no one has come close to her record, Radcliffe said, “Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany (a two-time London marathon winner) would do it.” She explained that maybe people are more focused on competing against each other than on improving themselves. “That mental attitude of never slowing down, even when you’re winning, probably helped me because I never thought, ‘I can relax now.’ It was always about pushing myself as hard as I could.” Radcliffe did not realize it at the time, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run that fast again, but she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"Text: ""When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a 'food revolution' happening in Britain. I believed we had created a series that truly contributed to this movement, but I still worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, memories, and science? I watched the first episode with mixed feelings of joy and fear. I didn’t need to worry. The success of the show led to many exciting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving travel and exploration. 

The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who creates golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent years pursuing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew I would disappoint some people by leaving out their favorites. I could imagine people asking, ‘Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that included something for everyone. This experience reinforced my belief that each person has their own idea of perfection, shaped by their emotions, memories, and surroundings. 

Despite the book’s title, I knew I wouldn’t claim that the recipes were the ‘best’. I believed that by using my cooking skills and scientific knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. This means trying out ideas and changing them until you create something unique. The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before, and I was excited to connect food with memories because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which made us stop filming there! While refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza."""

We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the engine cover. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking serious. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he finally said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big and empty, just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, because it was better to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything they talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. 

John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind; they waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it got dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. 

Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."

Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke good English. They discussed the music they were playing and their recent travels. 

“I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 

Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She had been chosen from thousands of applicants. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mother had filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to let her say no. Back then, she believed that making waves was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t think about trying to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in, surprised. “Tanglewood?” 

“Yeah.” 

“How old are you?” 

“Fifteen.” 

He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag. It was hard to know when she was just sharing her experiences or showing off. 

“It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying...” 

“Excuse me,” Liesel/Louisa said, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed. “Have you ever been to Japan?” 

He had long, shaggy hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool but still loved music. 

“Once. When I was about eight.” He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared beside her. 

“Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” 

“They're not the competition.” 

“Everyone is the competition.” 

Her grandfather took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what was said. 

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” 

Lucy liked that. Being someone important. Even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a difficult Rachmaninov piece. But in places like this, she felt she mattered."

“It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,” said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I decided to look into what experts say about this topic – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital world.

Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says, “Social networking is now a big part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do; they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.” 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where parents used to share jokes and gossip. He believes it helps teenagers build their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues with their friends.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson explains, “Adolescence is a time when you ask, ‘Who am I?’ Social networking can help you find your identity. You can share your favorite music or sports, discover what you like, and see that others have different opinions.” He adds that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media. He believes that using social media can be easier for shy people: “Talking online can feel more comfortable than face-to-face, and it helps you practice social skills in a less stressful way.”

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help quiet people with special interests connect with others who share those interests. “If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people like you, you can feel popular in a different way,” he says.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: “It’s young people who find new interests online, join groups of similar individuals, and create their own content who are really using social networks well.” She believes social networking is becoming a creative tool: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity, allowing photographers to connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interests. “This all helps with job opportunities and will be useful in the workplace,” she says. “Every business uses social media to sell and build brand awareness – and you need to know how it works to attract customers. For example, if you create a product and have 1,000 friends on different social networks, they could all be potential customers. If you connect all those networks, you have your customer base.”

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, agrees Matthews. “One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is an important skill in the 21st century and is essential for being employable in a digital world.”"

When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet time when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he thought would be the perfect family bonding experience. “Not enough people do this anymore,” he and my mother said repeatedly before our trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, “There are probably good reasons for that!”

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. Still, I had some ideas to cope. With barely enough space left for us in the car, we began “The Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our big home for smaller places for the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we were getting into.

We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. I noticed a pattern: deserts turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers.

Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. We laughed when we took pictures next to the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. “Bear jams,” where traffic stops to let bears cross, were common, and our close encounter with a bear (and a worried park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories.

As we drove, life back home faded away. Even the hotel we stayed in, which was old and had no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t dampen our excitement. In return for these inconveniences, I got to see the most beautiful views I’ve ever experienced. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, my family and I headed back south. My parents were right: you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something amazing. 

It was a bit sad to be home again, but at least I hadn’t fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our crazy journey to look through. I knew that the memories I would cherish most would be the unexpected and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would spend the next year finishing her last school courses, living under the care of the college Head. It was her final year at school, so it would not be fair for her to move. Amy was happy because she got the best room at the college, which had its own kitchen and study area. She also had free access to the Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. 

Rose only had vague memories of her grandmother from holidays, and she had never known her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was happy to get to know Rose again. Rose was not sure why her parents did not get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past, which meant Rose spent summers away from her only other family member. Rose was only ten years old when she last said goodbye, but she remembered those times as happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and had a talent for bringing people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon, which made her smile. Daisy was not a typical frail old lady; she seemed to go to more social events than anyone else.

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time, Rose insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission every time. She believed she could be trusted to do these things. She didn’t want to be reminded about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be taken around by her grandmother. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, which made Rose very happy. They all agreed it would be about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it again.

Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her a lot. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new moment in her life, a new piece in the puzzle that was her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first person to think she might write a novel. She says, “I believed that writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed very challenging. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’” The novel she started at that age is now about to be published. She recently told her former teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. The teacher had thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40, but Charlotte never considered waiting that long. 

It is a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a significant achievement: it has a strong and exciting story. The only thing that shows it was written by a teenager is the age of the main character. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn’t. She is confident, smart, and steady, which keeps her from being overly confident.

Charlotte understands that she is still young. When I ask her about the complex moral questions in her book, she says, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers.” She laughs and adds, “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I’m very wise. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.”

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often misrepresented in books aimed at them. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the socially awkward teenager. She finds it frustrating to read about these types. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who are not inadequate in some way. Some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience, and that can hurt their self-confidence.”

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy authors, but their books almost discouraged her from writing. “My favorite fantasy writers explore deep topics about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to write like that to create a good book and if I was capable of doing it.” However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which teaches that if readers can guess what will happen next, the suspense is likely gone.

Some might say that Charlotte’s parents, both journalists, played a key role in getting her novel published. Her father’s connection in publishing helped her book get read initially. She recognizes her good luck because it is hard for anyone to get a first novel read, regardless of their age. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."

“Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,” said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. “Now, who wants to go first?” The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew into the air, but something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, losing both skis, and fell into the snow. “Remember,” Gareth said kindly, “speed can be unpredictable.” 

I started to think that maybe freestyle skiing wasn’t for me. On previous skiing holidays, I had enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t like those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid of looking silly if I tried to join them. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a training center for freestyle skiing in the US. The center had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits, which was not a realistic way to prepare for the real slopes. 

After practicing indoors, we went outside to try our skills. “Progression is inevitable!” the center’s slogan said. “Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,” Gareth explained. “But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.” The “knuckle” is the flat area behind the jump before the slope goes down to the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which is safer. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which can hurt. So, speed is important.

At first, it was hard for me to ignore my fear and go fast towards the jump. My legs seemed to slow down as I got closer, and I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday, I felt exhausted. “You need to control the jump, not let it control you,” Gareth said. 

On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied the moves we would make while ski-jumping, and others helped us learn “aerial awareness” – understanding what our bodies were doing while in the air. Gareth gave us tips. My “aerial awareness” needed improvement – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off and then found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. 

We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes, but eventually, I landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of my achievement. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I made myself keep my speed up as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead of me, no longer attached to my feet."
114,"Text: 'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Your palms are sweaty with fear, and your nails are digging into the safety harness. The ride suddenly stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly moves upwards. There is a pause, then a sharp drop that makes your stomach feel like it is in the air. You quickly move forward, turn sharply to the left, and then go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you let out a scream of fear. But you chose to be here, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks each year. 

What is interesting to me is that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are a big business. To create the excitement and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers, designers, and marketing experts working behind the scenes. The idea of being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a childhood dream, but it is actually a difficult job. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe. They also need to introduce new ideas to keep visitors coming back. 

While many people think that rollercoasters have become more intense over time, most of the techniques used today, like the wheels that allow rides to go upside down, were invented by a US designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. During his time, rollercoasters were very extreme, which made some passengers uncomfortable. Now, designers have to follow the track designs provided by special ride manufacturers.

I spoke to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer' with a background in aeronautics, said, 'The skill is in putting the pieces together.' Dr. John Roberts, a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that this means quickly switching between feelings of excitement and safety, so people feel thrilled but not scared. 

To create an amazing ride, the teams behind rollercoasters must develop a strong story, like a space adventure or a fast jungle chase, that works with new features like the tallest rides or steepest drops to create a smooth experience. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, intuition, experience, and trial-and-error are very important. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed, saying that it helps to be passionate about thrills to understand what passengers want and to test rides before they open to the public.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would need to use new technology, like virtual reality. Walker said we should not expect too much from it. 'Virtual reality can add some excitement, but it is like painting an old rollercoaster beautifully,' he said. 'New technology appears all the time, and parks quickly adopt it because it is exciting and can enhance the ride experience. But the real physical experience of the coaster will remain the most important part for many years to come.'"
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating performances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both activities in her busy life. She explains, “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the orders of strict choreographers, and how stressful that can be. Choreographers can forget what it feels like to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, she teaches and enjoys working with young dancers. “A beginner dancer is often open to trying new ideas. In some ways, it’s easier to work with students than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they don’t yet know their strengths and weaknesses. This lack of understanding helps them accept even tough criticism. Sometimes they challenge what I say, but I appreciate their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. “There might be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain piece of music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece of music. I wish I could be more experimental and switch to different pieces, as it would help improve the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I often work on large productions where the music is already decided and cannot be changed.”

Miranda believes in making connections with new people. “It’s important to meet new people, but I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I need to adapt my way of working each time I go somewhere new, instead of just doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

We discuss a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,” Miranda says. “This one tries to show the real life inside a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer is getting many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized that feeling. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch, but it’s real. People often underestimate the work and dedication needed in ballet.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. “It’s when everything the company has worked on – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to expect, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help cover up a few mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props is distracting, and that’s disappointing.”

Miranda has done many different types of work, so I ask how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? “People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s a trend to focus on becoming an expert in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, but maybe one day I will be happy to be known for one thing. For now, I just want to explore more.”"
116,"Text: ""A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that there are amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main focus of the film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to carry it. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to keep going. I have done many walking trips in recent years, but this was very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads, which allowed me to stop at cafés and enjoy a cappuccino on the sofa instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. I often had to tell people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."""
117,"Text: ""When I read about guided swimming trips around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually travel with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn’t be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked confused, he smiled and showed me on board.

Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to talk before our first swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would follow us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first proper swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. However, I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own.

The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the scenery. As the swims got longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. I felt like I didn’t need the support boat much anymore. I can hardly wait to come back again next year."""
118,"Text: ""Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it has many rewards. Since I started this job, I have traveled to many places, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting, which makes it a great job for someone young like me! 

As a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family, so I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed in my mind when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new path.

At the interview for the flight attendant position, there were many young people, and many of us were hired. Most of us had good qualifications and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I didn’t just say I loved to travel, like everyone else. Instead, I talked about my skills and past work experience, and that helped me get the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because there are many benefits, but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: 'no one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take my job home with me. If I do have to deal with difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"""
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some children feel nervous at first, but with encouragement, they agree to try, and in the end, they all reach the top. This makes them feel great.

At the beginning of the week, some children miss home. It is not the youngest ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not allow them to use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and by the end of their week, they all come to us and thank us because they have had a great time.

It is not only the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call often to ask how their child is doing, which is not really necessary. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to tell the parents to call back later. We sometimes get children who come dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it is important."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was not easy. The UK has more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night, with many people wanting to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

What do his friends think of the show? ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 

Although the young actors were already musicians, some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said that the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
