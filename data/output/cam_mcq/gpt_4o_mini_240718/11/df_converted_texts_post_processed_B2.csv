Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also letting many people know where you are, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience, which can seem exciting: wealth, fame, and more. However, we often realize too late that sharing too much can be risky.
In the early days of the internet, a group of online pioneers explored these risks. They faced many challenges, like losing jobs and friends, long before social media existed. These pioneers, known as bloggers, have valuable experiences that we can learn from. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web, which was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a chance to share his own life. He created a personal website filled with stories, photos, and art.
In January 1996, he began a daily blog, and many people were interested in his adventures. Hall was open about everything; he would write about any topic. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the art in his work. However, one day, visitors found his homepage replaced by a video called ""Dark Night."" Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the problem of sharing online remains.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they wouldn’t say in person. However, the internet is not a separate world where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she later got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once a symbol of the risks of sharing online, she has learned to manage her self-revelation. What Armstrong teaches us is important: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."

Some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we do not understand. How can any scientist argue with that? Scientists can sometimes be a bit arrogant, but even the most confident physicist would not say they know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt it was important to warn the public about the film, calling it everything from ‘atrocious’ to ‘very dangerous’. This made me curious to see the movie. 
At first, I did not understand why there was so much excitement. Various scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It was only when the film talked about some of these discoveries that I began to understand the excitement – discoveries like how water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the movie only provided pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to by happy people and ugly after being exposed to angry people. 
Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is clear and easy to understand. However, scientists often respond with skepticism. I understand their point. The idea that water can be influenced by thoughts is amazing and could mean there are new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Pretty pictures of crystals, while nice, are not enough. 
The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a type of energy that comes from nowhere, which could be connected to a force that is making the universe expand. The evidence for this comes from many years of research in labs and observatories around the world. 
In fact, discoveries are being made that show the universe is indeed stranger than we ever thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy’. Besides the movie, there are also amazing discoveries happening on Earth. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they actually occur, a delay we do not notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are connections between life on Earth and the design of the universe. 
Despite what some people might think, science is not close to being complete. In fact, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever. Many natural phenomena cannot be understood as we once thought. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the world’s top physicists are trying to create a Theory of Everything, which would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Overall, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"""In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes work together to create a beautiful landscape that I cherish. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.
Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My pattern is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a group of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I never write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing may use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.
I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was challenging, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my beginning as a short-story writer.
One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can take longer). It’s not the same level of commitment as writing a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. For me, writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. So, writing short stories is a refreshing change.
Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas – a thought, a word, an image, or anything. It’s often like jazz improvisation, where the story takes me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This gives me comfort. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.
When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I have in writing short stories. In this way, short stories are like a testing ground for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment the way I want to within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows I have placed in the world, faint traces I have left behind. I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."""

Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, but it also has practical uses, such as curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but can also pose threats to our existence. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often struggles to do so. It has influenced poets, politicians, and thinkers, and while its beauty is clear to some, its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and the mistakes made by scientists are often ignored or exaggerated.
The history of science is filled with conflict. Old theories are often changed or completely replaced, similar to how new music styles are sometimes mocked before becoming popular. Scientists can be jealous and angry, and conflict is a big part of scientific history. This book will show how scientific ideas have changed not just science, but also many areas of human thought. While science has practical benefits, we will focus on the ideas themselves, appreciating their beauty while also being ready to question them. We must recognize both the creativity and the limitations of the human mind.
Science is always changing. There is always a scientist who is proving another scientist wrong. Most of the time, these changes do not disturb society, but sometimes they challenge our established beliefs. For example, in the seventeenth century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Now, physics has questioned many basic ideas, leading us to understand that observing the universe can change it, and we often do not fully understand our own concepts.
Some people think that the changing nature of scientific theories shows that science cannot explain the universe. However, these changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. For instance, Isaac Newton explained more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. Science may make mistakes, but it continues to progress. 
At the end of the nineteenth century, many physicists believed there was not much left to discover in physics. Then, new discoveries like radioactivity, X-rays, and quantum mechanics changed everything. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people claim that a complete theory explaining everything about the universe is coming soon. 
Science is not just a harmless activity. In the last two hundred years, we have moved from being observers of nature to having some control over it. This has sometimes upset the balance of nature in ways we do not fully understand. It is important for everyone, not just scientists, to understand scientific advances because they will shape the future for our children. Science is now a key part of how humanity thinks about and shapes its future. The decisions made in science can impact budgets, health, and even the future of life on Earth."
5,C2,"'Since around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased in some cases. This raised new questions about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in “the power of the word on the page.” Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can exist together in the market, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books still comes up. It does not matter if people are trying to predict or dismiss this idea; what is important is that the thought of books disappearing continues to spark our imagination and create strong discussions. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence shows otherwise? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding change and innovation. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium “killing” another often appears with new technologies. Even before digital technologies, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many believed radio would disappear. However, radio survived by finding new ways to be used; people began listening in cars, on trains, and in factories. The idea of books disappearing is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been thought to threaten print books as sources of culture and entertainment. Some believed the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others, imagining a perfect digital future, exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. It is not surprising that the idea of the death of the book appears during times of technological change. This story reflects our mixed feelings of hope and fear about new technology. To understand why these feelings are so common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with different media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show how we develop strong ties with objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops when they don’t work. Therefore, when a new technology, like e-readers, appears, it does not just mean economic and social change. It also makes us rethink our connection with something that has become a part of our daily lives. As technology advances, we often miss what we used to know but no longer have. This is why entire industries grow around older products and technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people want original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older form. The same happened when photography changed from analog to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a new appreciation for the physical qualities of “old” books – even their often unpleasant smell. This should reassure those who worry about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be an interesting story about the power of technology and our fear of change. In fact, one way we try to understand change is by using familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings. Easy to remember and share, the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our personal world – and ultimately, of ourselves.'"

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday morning at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time. I wanted to explore how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By writing about the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to show a different side of their personalities and careers. 
The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I believe, “Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.” This book is not just about the creative work itself, but about the daily routines that support it. It is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about the writer. 
I face similar questions in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work on many things a little each day? When time is short, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not claim to answer these questions, as some may only be resolved individually. However, I have provided examples of how many successful people have faced similar challenges. 
The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary and thoughtless, but it can also be a useful tool for managing limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine helps us stay focused and avoid being controlled by our moods. The psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule.
This book began during a moment of procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, while working at a small architecture magazine, I was supposed to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself cleaning my workspace and making coffee. I am a “morning person,” able to concentrate well in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them. This led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day, and now this book.
The blog was simple; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I have gathered a much larger and better-researched collection while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I have let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. 
I want to acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was not interested in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period; instead, he was fascinated by the very beginnings of life and ancient creatures found in grey rocks.
After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard wondered if he would get a job, especially in the type of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities, but he knew that deserving a job does not always mean getting one. When the Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London opened, he applied, but he did not have high hopes.
On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and the professor who replaced him was someone who disliked him. This professor managed to ensure that Howard got the job. Howard was surprised and grateful, but later learned that it was not because of his skills. He felt a bit disappointed but was mostly happy to have the job and do the work he loved.
Howard often thought about how organized his professional life was, where he could plan and achieve goals, compared to the chaos of personal life. Many people can affect your life, and sometimes a stranger can change everything. This happened to Howard when his briefcase, which had his lecture notes, was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he went back to college, called to postpone his lecture, and reported the theft. After that, he went for coffee and met a colleague who was with a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. 
From this meeting, Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This would be his biggest challenge and help his career. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,C1,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they look like maggots, they are said to have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. One of the challenges Spence and his team are working on is how to make eating bugs more acceptable. Through his research on how our senses work together to create our experience of flavor, Spence is quietly influencing what we eat and drink. This includes the products of large food companies and the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food in detail, a field informally called gastro physics. Many factors affect taste, such as who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and weight of plates and cutlery, and background noise. Spence’s book, The Perfect Meal, co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting facts for anyone who enjoys food. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? And we eat about 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others. 
Spence’s lab in Oxford is not very high-tech. He describes it as ""low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff."" There are soundproof booths that look like large safes, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who cannot afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a large food company. In the past, research funded by the industry was often seen as less serious in universities. However, since the government asked universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research has become more accepted. Spence is currently helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He points out that it is important for these companies to help their customers live longer. Surprisingly, many companies have been making these reductions quietly, so customers do not notice the changes. ""Research shows that when you tell people what you’re doing, they focus on the taste and often do not like it as much,"" he explains.
Spence first met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a large food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was strange, even though food is scientific. Blumenthal helped change this view. Their collaboration led to the creation of the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in Blumenthal’s five-star restaurant. Interestingly, Spence notes that artists from the early 1900s, known as the Italian futurists, were already experimenting with sounds and food, but it did not become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence’s research on the senses in many ways. For example, he found that higher-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. ""It’s surprising how shapes can affect taste, or how a song can change how you experience a flavor,"" he says. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream melts, but they did not match the music to the taste, which is often the case, according to Spence.
What are dinner parties like at Spence’s home? Once, they had rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they played with remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. ""We’ve had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and ten different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,C1,"'Our brains are busier than ever before. We are overwhelmed with facts, false information, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information. We have to sort through this to find what we need to know and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more than before. Thirty years ago, travel agents made our flight bookings and salespeople helped us find what we needed in stores. Now, we do most things ourselves. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, with the help of our smartphones. They have become part of our busy lives, filling every spare moment. 
However, there is a problem. Although we think we are multitasking – doing several things at once – this is a strong and dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says that our brains are not designed to multitask well. When people think they are multitasking, they are actually switching quickly from one task to another. Each time they switch, it costs them mentally. So, we are not like expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried that something will fall. Even though we believe we are getting a lot done, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. 
Multitasking increases the production of stress hormones, which can overstimulate our brains and cause confusion. It creates a craving for constant stimulation, rewarding our brains for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to stay focused, can easily be distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask harms our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this problem info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by tiredness. 
Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, found that learning new information while multitasking sends that information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do their homework while watching TV, the information goes to a part of the brain for storing skills, not facts. Without the distraction of TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember. 
Additionally, multitasking often involves making decisions: ‘Should I answer this text or ignore it? How should I respond?’ Decision-making is also hard on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental energy as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can end up making poor choices about important matters. 
In discussions about information overload, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not about disliking email itself, but about the overwhelming amount of communication we receive. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does for work, he said, ‘He answers emails.’ His father agreed that this was quite true. We feel we must reply to our emails, but it seems impossible to do that and accomplish anything else.'"
10,C1,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were mostly ignored. Animals had behaviors, those behaviors led to measurable results, and science recorded those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral systems was considered unscientific. But this has changed recently. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has started to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate that may never be fully answered: do animals have consciousness? This debate leads to another important question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong that guides their behavior? 
In a recent experiment with cows that had to open a locked gate to get food, it was clear that cows who opened the gate themselves showed more happiness – by jumping and kicking – than those who had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we produce and eat beef? While the observations may not be disputed, their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the only logical response to this new research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is close to a major change in ethics, similar to the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should at least rethink how we view animal intelligence. He says, ""the only reasonable idea is that animals have a simpler theory of mind than ours."" Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop attributing human feelings to animals. These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks, what it is like to be a bat? 
Balcombe describes an important experiment he conducted that seems to show that starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with plenty of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. At first, both groups were fed tasty worms from one box and bad worms from another, and they learned to take only from the tasty box. But later, when only bad worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, ""We look back with disgust on a time when there was racism. Our view of animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger."" If he were the only one with this view of animal consciousness, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He says, ""What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. At the start of the 20th century, some people thought animals thought just like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are moving back in that direction. But it is a very controversial topic, and we should be careful of academics with strong personal opinions."""

Critical thinking is a way of engaging with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., believes that arguing can help us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it also changes how we solve complex problems and makes it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but attractive ideas, trends, and opinions. The large amount of information available can overwhelm our ability to think clearly. Ironically, having more data does not always lead to better knowledge or decision-making. West notes that the quality of our thinking has not improved much despite the increase in information.
According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading literature, with a decline of 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media has a negative effect. She says that less reading may lead to weaker critical thinking skills. People are now more focused on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing.
However, we still do not have a clear answer about how technology affects critical thinking. Because of the growing presence of technology, critical thinking has become more complicated, and experts can no longer rely on old beliefs. It is easy to see computers, video games, and the internet as either good or bad, but they can be both, and different technologies can have different effects. For instance, a computer game might help or hurt critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis skills, but constantly clicking on links can prevent deeper thinking.
Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how people think. She notes that reading helps thinking and imagination in ways that visual media like video games and television do not. Reading develops imagination, reflection, critical thinking, and vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are real-time and do not allow time for reflection or imagination. As a result, many young people may not reach their full potential.
How society views technology affects how it thinks about critical thinking. This is especially clear when looking at video games and thinking skills. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, points out that video games are often seen as harmful to children. However, they can also be a good learning tool. Evidence shows that playing video games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging environments that mimic the real world. These games also allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to access otherwise. In the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it is important to examine how technology affects thinking and analysis."

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who also writes about how we should live. He chose this job after feeling unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the value of manual jobs, while his latest book discusses how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he saw advertisements on a credit card machine while entering his pin number. Crawford realized that these ads make it hard for us to focus on what we really want to think about. We often do not notice how much our attention is pulled away from our own thoughts. It is becoming harder to think clearly or remember conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people often stop talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we now experience the world through things like video games and apps, which can manipulate our desires. 
Many people share his concerns. For example, office workers often complain about emails but still spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us, making it hard to concentrate, especially during boring moments. While there is no clear evidence that our attention spans are shorter, we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Some believe this problem is caused by technology, but Crawford thinks technology just makes our self-obsession easier. With so many choices, it is hard to control ourselves, which affects our social lives. People prefer texting friends instead of talking to them in person. Crawford warns that by only interacting with screens, we might lose important connections in society.
He uses his gym as an example. In the past, there was one music player for everyone, which sometimes caused disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds, and the gym has lost its social atmosphere. Real connections often happen through disagreements, where people share different tastes and find common ground.
Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to manage noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world in a more meaningful way. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real experiences. No video can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or the gravel under a motorbike. These activities require good judgment and awareness of others around us. 
Crawford argues that when we engage with the real world, we see that manufactured experiences are not as fulfilling. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment in daily life. There are many benefits to this approach, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and makes it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, paying attention to one thing can help us pay attention to others more easily."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. It is fine to say you study or teach philosophy, but calling yourself a philosopher might make people think you believe you know some special truth. This idea is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. Still, this stereotype makes me think twice about how I describe myself.
One reason this stereotype exists is that philosophers are seen as people who judge the actions of others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical thinking, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers agree with this, philosophy is still often linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting what society says can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices.
However, living an examined life does not mean you have to read many philosophical books or dedicate your life to deep thinking. It just means paying more attention to the everyday experiences that shape our lives to make sure they are meaningful. You do not need to be a wise person living away from society to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is important for a good life.
Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more separated from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are often linked to expensive academic journals. Because of this, philosophers have little chance to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. For many people, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. While some philosophers have tried to change this view, many have accepted it. As philosophy has become more focused on specific, technical debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand, making it almost impossible for those without training to engage with it. In some ways, philosophy has stepped back from society.
I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully capture what I do, as ethics is often seen as related to formal rules and laws. There is a new development in philosophical thinking: ethics is now often understood as applied ethics, which examines the fairness of specific social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.
However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people think more deeply about the actions and beliefs that shape their lives. Sometimes this might confirm what we already know; other times, we may find that our beliefs are hard to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we can benefit everyone."

People who love food, like foodies and chefs, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, throughout history, discussions about food have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers talk about eating, they usually use it as a way to discuss something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, conversations about food seem to be about food, but they often explore deeper ideas that are only loosely related to food.
One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. However, his name has become closely linked to a love for eating and drinking. You can see his name in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites. These businesses likely hope to attract customers by connecting their products to famous philosophers.
Food is also a social and cultural experience. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities help us find dining partners and provide the means to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more important ways than with other things, making it a clear topic for philosophical discussion.
Once food is prepared, critics begin to talk and write about it. But why do these critics have such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, good food critics are just better at describing flavors. This area has not been studied much in philosophy, as most research on perception has focused on sight. This should change.
Another important aspect of food is its beauty. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, with the growth of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed in terms of beauty, just like art or poetry. However, food is consumed when we enjoy it, unlike art, which remains after we experience it. Aesthetic objects need to last over time, so it is incorrect to think of food as something that can be considered beautiful in the same way.
There are also many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? The answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will always question why we choose what we do. This kind of academic discussion about food is important.
Cooking at home and in restaurants can be very different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone comes together to share food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, but only to those who are qualified, and their relationships are more like colleagues than friends.
A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we can learn to appreciate others by enjoying their food, and second, we can build personal connections with people from other cultures by sharing meals. This practice has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy come alive for readers."

Rob Daviau, from the US, designs ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging enough anymore. This made him think about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect the next? He changed a classic board game called Risk to create a new version called Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and players’ past actions become part of the game. Daviau said: “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”
Daviau was then asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very well received, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world.
Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to make sure the story stays strong. To do this, they use testers to see how the games will play out. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. The first few games might be great, but then after a few more games, it can start to break. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”
Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was developing the idea, he thought it would only appeal to a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was really different and pretty good, but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest improvements in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, excitement, and intensity. There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than to learn a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.”
Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of a story unfolding was more important than worries about the game lasting a long time. He mentioned, “At first, I was worried about making changes and ruining my board, but that worry went away with Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice in the cinema, right? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling aspect like in video games.”
The legacy format is inspired not only by video games but also by the popularity of TV series. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but it’s not enough to just have a general plan.”
Daviau feels proud of his work but is also curious to see how others will use the idea. He thinks that soon gamers will be asking, “What’s new?” Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is not so sure. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."

Not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared widely online. Part of the fun of such escape stories, which also include animals like rats and llamas, is that we like to think of animals as being like us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very intelligent and look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways.
Some people think that comparing animals to humans is not scientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually a mistake to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this mistake ""anthropodenial."" He has studied many years of research on animal intelligence and found that, except for having a fully developed language, animals show many behaviors that we thought were unique to humans. These include remembering the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding what others want. In other words, animals are smarter than we often think.
Dr. de Waal believes that anthropodenial is a recent idea. In medieval and early modern Europe, people thought animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world with his theory of evolution, wrote that the difference between humans and higher animals is one of degree, not kind.
In the twentieth century, a new way of thinking called behaviorism focused on training animals with rewards and punishments. During this time, many people saw animals as simple machines or robots with instincts. Anyone who believed that animals had thoughts and feelings was often seen as unrealistic or unscientific. This change in thinking happened at the same time that humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly.
Fortunately, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand animal intelligence better. He believes that we are beginning to see that animal thinking is similar to human thinking, even if they are not the same. He says, “The times are changing,” and notes that there is a lot of new information about animal intelligence available online.
Dr. de Waal argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique skills of each species. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, it might think we are not very smart.
Dr. de Waal is not completely convinced that Inky’s escape had a happy ending. He believes that while octopuses have escaped before, it is unlikely that Inky knew how to find a drain that led to the ocean. However, he understands that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (a food they liked) and others received grapes (which they liked even more), the monkeys with cucumbers became upset when they saw their friends getting grapes. This study was published in a well-known scientific journal, but what really made people believe the results was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our minds work in unique ways."

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to what happened during industrialization. Robots have been used in car and factory production for many years, but experts believe we are about to see a big increase in the use of robots in many other areas. Many people think that robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people also believe their current jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not. Every industry will be affected by robots in the coming years.
For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This job would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is Tally, a robot from a San Francisco startup called Simbe Robotics. Tally moves around supermarkets to check that products are well-stocked and correctly priced, rather than cleaning the aisles.
Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot yet fix or program themselves, which could lead to new jobs for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not forget the importance of human skills in the workplace. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come from reducing human interaction.
Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His recent report predicts that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work safely with humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled because there aren’t enough skilled workers.
Zhang says that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes that these workers should not rely on the government to protect their jobs but should find ways to retrain themselves. People can no longer expect to do the same job for their entire lives.
At the same time, advances in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, such as robots that can walk and interact with us in new ways. Zhang sees this as a great opportunity for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy. With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce that will include robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is reported to have answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response reflects a common question people have: why do climbers take on such dangerous challenges? Some may find inspiration in his answer, as it encourages people to pursue their dreams and face the unknown. However, it also suggests that the main reason for climbing could simply be for adventure and enjoyment.
In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different climbing activities, from playing on boulders to climbing high mountains, each with its own rules. He argued that the way climbers approach a climb—like how much equipment they use—depends on the rules of that specific activity. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and casual conversations.
Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing brings. However, climbing can also feel very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing. Yet, some argue that having fewer choices can make a climber's life simpler, which can also feel like a form of freedom.
When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of our nature; humans are built to take on challenges and test their limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing may be more about our biology than logical thinking.
US academic Brian Treanor also contributed to this discussion. He believes that climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While he acknowledges that not all climbers show these qualities, he thinks they are especially important in today's world, which often avoids risks. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits by helping people develop traits that allow them to thrive in everyday life.
Another interesting idea is that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be fully dedicated to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that climbs done independently are more challenging and deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or with help from tools like bottled oxygen. This claim raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.
We can also explore climbing from a different perspective. Many climbers report experiences like being fully present in the moment or going with the flow. The physical effort of climbing, the focused meditation while climbing, and the intuitive problem-solving involved are all key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those used in Zen philosophy, which aims to train the mind for peace. This idea offers another perspective on why people are attracted to climbing."
79,C2,"'In recent years, one of the most interesting changes in education in the UK and around the world has been the push to get new students involved in research as early as possible. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists who are discovering new things in fields like medicine. Instead, research is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. The skills you learn from research will help you not only in your studies but also in your future jobs, as they teach you how to think about the world and how to approach your work.
As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say; you create new knowledge. Creating knowledge starts with asking questions instead of just accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we are given? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.
Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes and new knowledge. However, research can also start from simple questions and everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questioning about issues, practices, and events. Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done research for school projects or answered questions at work since you started. You have asked questions that led you to investigate topics, whether it was about planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training a pet, finding the right music system, or shopping online.
In college and higher education, it is expected that you will have a curious mind, identify problems and questions, critically explore and evaluate information, and create your own responses and knowledge to contribute to discussions. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning comes from listening to teachers and texts. It might feel disrespectful to question established knowledge or authority, and you may think you should be told what is important to learn. However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.
This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students, academics, and professionals, but we need to engage with it, think critically, and test it. We should not just accept everything we read as true; instead, we must analyze whether the information is logical, well-reasoned, and supported by evidence. We should avoid blindly trusting the facts and information we receive from others.'"
80,C2,"'Cities have always been important places for ideas and creativity. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were popular spots where people discussed science and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artist Pablo Picasso talked about new art. However, living in a city can be difficult. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Today, cities are known for their creativity, but they can also feel unnatural and overwhelming.
Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. While it has been known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in cities can actually make us think less clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in urban areas. Studies have shown that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains because they give us a break from the busy city life.
This research comes at a time when more people than ever are living in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into concrete areas, surrounded by many strangers. It has become clear that these crowded environments can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. For example, when walking down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people walking, busy traffic, and confusing street layouts. These small tasks can tire us out because cities are full of distractions that require us to constantly shift our focus. This process of deciding what to pay attention to takes a lot of mental energy.
In contrast, natural environments do not require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our attention. Natural settings have things that naturally attract our focus but do not cause stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. In nature, our minds can relax and recharge.
Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban areas. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a break from city life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people have tried many methods to boost brain performance, such as energy drinks or changing office designs, nothing seems to work as well as simply walking in nature.
Given the many mental challenges caused by city life, we must ask: Why do cities keep growing? And why do they remain centers of creativity, even in the digital age? Recent research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same crowded features of cities that can hurt our attention and memory—like busy streets and close contact with many people—are also linked to innovation. Scientists believe that the ‘concentration of social interactions’ is key to urban creativity. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, helps it thrive as a center for technology. On the other hand, less crowded areas may produce fewer new ideas over time. 
The challenge is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its unique advantages. Because, as the saying goes, there will always be a moment when someone says: ‘I’m tired of nature; take me to the city!’'"
81,C2,"
Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to support this idea. However, I believe that studying the mind should not be limited to just what is inside our bodies. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as our brain cells, play a role in how we think. 
From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have all been important in human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, I suggest that what is outside our heads can also be part of our minds. It is easy to see why people connect the mind with the brain. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their surroundings. This makes sense for neuroscientists who use brain scans, but it often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. 
I do not want to deny the importance of the brain in thinking, but I want to highlight that the mind is more than just the brain. It is more useful to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects can help us think and how they become part of our bodies, like when we use clay to make numbers or use a stone to create a tool. It also examines how these interactions have changed over time and what those changes mean for our thinking.
This approach gives us new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of the role of objects in thinking. For example, think of a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be linked, and it illustrates the flexibility of the human mind. By using the stick, the blind person can turn touch into a form of sight, and the stick becomes part of their body in a way. 
The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can change significantly by using new technologies. I see the human mind as a work in progress, always evolving. It is important to remember that, no matter what form the “stick” has taken throughout history—whether it is a simple stone tool or a modern smartphone—its main purpose is to connect us to the world. 
Through the “stick,” humans explore and understand their environment, and they also find new ways to move forward. This is different from how monkeys use sticks to get food. For humans, “sticks” help us satisfy our curiosity. This special ability to engage with material culture explains why humans create things more than any other species, and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as we interact with the material world. I want to emphasize the importance of material objects in understanding the mind. MET provides a new way to see how different types of material culture, from ancient tools to modern technology, have influenced who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, humans have been using it since the beginning of our existence."
82,C1,"""Few inventions have changed the course of civilization as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture at all levels – from practical and scientific uses to industrial and artistic ones, as well as a new world of entertainment that came with the camera. Historians say that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the United States to the visual arts. In no other art form has American work been so significant. This is a bold statement, but it shows how photography has become central to American thought and art. To fully appreciate its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century. 
Why was this new art so attractive? First, photography was a mechanical process that matched a growing interest in technology, reflecting a national attitude that accepted change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into homes in a stunning way. Second, the camera became the preferred tool for expressing identity, allowing people to create images for public viewing in a country where personal and national identities were always being formed and reformed. Third, the camera has been very important for families, providing a way to keep a record of their lives, even if that record is somewhat idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the trend towards realism in American art, which focused on everyday life.
Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. The fact that a photograph is made by a machine, rather than drawn by hand, gives it a unique quality: photographs are records of events, people, and things; they show at least what was in front of the camera, giving them a sense of objectivity. However, because each photograph is taken by a specific person, it also carries a personal point of view. We might look at a photograph and think we understand its meaning, especially if we recognize the subject. This is why photography has often been called a ‘universal language’. But the meaning of a photograph is more complicated than that. 
Few things in front of us – whether a person, object, or event – have their own meaning. No image is presented to us without some context that shapes our understanding of it, such as a caption in a newspaper, a layout in a magazine, or its position in a gallery or book. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and role in its culture: Why did the photographer take the picture? How did people first see it? Additionally, the same image might be viewed in different places and times, and its meaning would change accordingly.
For a long time, the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized, but today it is well understood. In recent decades, starting with U.S. artist Andy Warhol’s use of photographs in his paintings and silk screens, artists have been including photographs in their work in many ways. In summary, photographic vision has become an essential part of painting in art history, not something separate from it."""
83,C1,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. Everyone has a mental life, so we have some understanding of what this means. Although we can study mental life in rats, monkeys, and humans, it is still a complex idea. James focused mainly on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements like thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not be influenced by scientific facts.
Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions on complicated psychological topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in different situations. Psychologists help us separate subjective thoughts, which can be biased, from objective facts.
Psychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind and brain. While psychologists study the brain, they do not yet fully understand how it works in relation to our feelings, hopes, and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not easily observable. We can only understand them indirectly through behavior.
Studying psychology is similar to solving a crossword puzzle. It requires evaluating and interpreting clues, which must come from careful observation and accurate measurement. These observations need to be analyzed rigorously and interpreted logically. Psychology often involves complex interactions, and understanding them requires advanced techniques and theories. Like any other science, psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to influence the processes it studies. When these goals are met, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply this knowledge to improve people's lives.
Psychological research has been useful in many areas, such as improving teaching methods, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been studied scientifically for the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to answer psychological questions. They aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today. However, introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only allows us to see a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than on their own experiences."

In a storehouse in a regular business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place that shows the failures of consumer products – the opposite of the positive, success-focused world of modern marketing. Here, you can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were not popular. This collection, owned by a company called GfK, is informally known as the Museum of Failed Products. It displays products that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own sad story involving designers, marketers, and salespeople.
What is most surprising about this museum is that it exists as a successful business. You might think that any good manufacturer would keep a collection of their failed products. However, the executives who visit the museum show that this is not common. They often avoid thinking about their failures and do not keep samples of their unsuccessful products. The museum itself started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, wanted to create a ‘reference library’ of consumer products, not just failed ones. Starting in the 1960s, he began buying samples of every new item he could find. He did not realize that most products fail. By collecting new products without discrimination, he ended up with mostly unsuccessful ones.
Today’s culture of optimism may explain why many products ended up in the museum. Each product likely went through meetings where no one noticed it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into a failing product to try to save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and everyone involved may choose to forget about it.
This focus on optimism is especially strong in the growing ‘self-help’ industry. A common idea here is ‘positive visualization’: if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to happen. Some researchers believe that our ability to see the positive side is so important for survival that it has become part of our nature. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot has found that a healthy mind may be designed to see good outcomes as more likely than they really are. Her research suggests that well-balanced people often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events, unlike those who are depressed.
But how effective are these ‘positive fantasies about the future’? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied this question. Their findings are surprising: spending time thinking about how well things could go can actually reduce most people’s motivation to reach their goals. For example, groups of people who were encouraged to imagine having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.
Psychologist Carol Dweck believes that our experiences with failure depend on our beliefs about ability. Dweck says that people with a ‘fixed mindset’ think ability is something you are born with, while those with a ‘growth mindset’ believe it can develop through effort and challenges. People with a fixed mindset find failure very scary because it shows they did not meet expectations. For example, a sports star who thinks of himself as a ‘natural’ may not practice enough and fail to reach his potential. On the other hand, people with a growth mindset see failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles grow stronger when they are pushed to their limits, where they tear and heal. The deeper message is that having a growth mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are making us rethink home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid enough, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?
What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some of their home games in the Far East to reach more fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. This belief may lead them to confuse cause and effect. When a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans often remember that when they cheered, a goal was scored, but they forget the many times when their cheering did not lead to success.
However, there is one common belief among fans that is supported by scientific evidence. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a well-known experiment, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another group watched the same match in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team than those who watched in silence. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers found that referees try to avoid extra stress from making calls against the home team. They do not simply do what the crowd wants; they try to avoid making the crowd angry.
Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. One reason for this change may be travel. In the past, travel was difficult, but now football players travel in great comfort, and if their hotel is not good enough, someone from the club will find them a better one. Local conditions used to be very different, but now top stadiums are becoming more similar in their efficiency.
Despite these explanations, none fully explains the data. These changes, like pampered players and similar stadiums, have happened in the last decade or two. The mystery remains why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and in baseball, the focus is more on individual matchups between the batter and pitcher. Team sports require coordination among teammates. In basketball, winning depends on everyone working together, which builds confidence when playing at home, regardless of the playing conditions.
Another possibility relates to a more aggressive side of sports. Researchers found that players’ testosterone levels were normal before training and away games, but increased by up to 67% before home games. This feeling of defending their home may connect to a basic instinct to protect their territory, as seen in the recent Rugby World Cup. In two important games, the underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing determination and a refusal to be intimidated—this is a sign of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,C1,"""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is appreciated by many athletes and their coaches. The reason is clear. First, there is debate about who originally said it, with many other golfers from that time being suggested. Second, the meaning is not straightforward. Player did not mean 'lucky' in a real sense; he was being ironic. His true message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ But there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, is part of the nature-nurture debate. This debate discusses whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice, especially in sports. However, it is not really a balanced debate; nurture has clearly won. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent in sports, music, business, and other areas comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that anyone can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has inspired many popular books, including Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, Talent Is Overrated, and Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice. These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor and suggest that ‘10,000 hours is both necessary and enough to make anyone an expert in anything.’ 
However, as Epstein discusses in his interesting book, this is often not the case. He points out a major problem in much of the research on what makes people excellent: it usually looks only at successful people. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate what is natural from what comes from environment, support, opportunity, and hard work. Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and from the Caribbean to the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the key to success in the toughest sled dog race may be the drive and desire of the husky dogs, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary. Some interpretations of the 10,000-hours rule assume that commitment and determination are choices we can make. But what if, as the huskies show, a person’s drive also has a genetic part? These examples highlight the complexity of the topic. 
Epstein makes a distinction between hardware (nature) and software (nurture) and agrees that in elite athletes, both are necessary. He does not ignore the importance of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, Epstein also looks at cases where genetics are very important and cannot be overlooked. He also discusses race and gender issues. He asks: ‘If only practice hours matter, then why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""
87,C1,"A recent international report shows that many children living in rich, developed countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, like televisions or computers, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main problem. This idea matches other discussions about childhood today. A follow-up study interviewed some children to understand their feelings better. The study found that many children do not wish for the latest technology; instead, they said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many people over 40 often talk about how free they felt as children, spending long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They believe this was much better and healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they are the ones who created these protective rules for their own kids, keeping them from exploring freely. 
Griffiths’ book contains strong arguments. She discusses how the fear of dangers in the outside world and the focus on child-centered consumerism are connected. Parents’ fears of danger lead them to keep their children at home, which benefits the toy and gadget industry that sells entertainment for indoor kids. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or requiring kids to wear goggles during traditional playground games. While I am not sure how common these strict rules are, Griffiths expresses her anger about them in a powerful way. She also talks passionately about other issues related to childhood freedoms and rules, from fairy tales to school regulations. 
However, the problem is that Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas and ignores important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares the modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths has a romantic view of children. Although she acknowledges that children can be mischievous, she mostly presents an idealized view of them that may not match reality. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Also, not all children may want to follow the adventurous model that Griffiths admires. What about the shy, cautious children who prefer to stay at home? Perhaps the real issue is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too hard to explore."

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and in my life, but this skill is not just from my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play. 
My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those that have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are allowed to. 
Play is a natural way for adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling their emotions. Creativity is essential for success in today’s world. We no longer need people who just follow instructions or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. 
If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce. Creative minds are playful minds. Adults we call geniuses are those who keep their childlike creativity throughout their lives. Albert Einstein said that school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he found it again after leaving school. He called his innovative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen next. 
We cannot teach creativity, but we can lose it through schooling that focuses on fixed questions instead of children’s own questions. More importantly, children need to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which are important for their future. 
Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players know they must keep each other happy to continue the game. This ability to quit makes play a very democratic activity. 
However, school has become more difficult: breaks are shorter, homework is more, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, adult-led sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. “Play dates” with adults have replaced unsupervised play, and adults often feel they must step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. 
These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact over time. They are caused by various social factors, including parents’ fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 
Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,C1,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is much easier than the old way of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, having this access also means there is a higher chance of making mistakes.
For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him find a job. But the executive was upset by the request. She felt it was wrong to share her contacts with someone she didn’t know. Instead of just rejecting his request, she sent a harsh and sarcastic message that became very popular online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret how she reacted. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could actually help them.
Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. Ironically, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and create a different image of themselves. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. With the right pictures and songs on Facebook, you could seem like a more interesting person. 
However, using social media for professional networking is very different. For some young people, the line between personal and professional use is not clear. They may still think that being bold and confident online is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.
One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual in their messages and come off as arrogant. This reinforces the idea that young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.
So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing some research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of getting a helpful response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to leave a good impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it needs to be used carefully to avoid being ignored."
90,C1,"""Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. Looking at the numbers, newspapers appear to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by about one-third to one-half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26 percent of US citizens, down from 45 percent in 2001. Many people confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will be gone within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were finished and that the daily newspaper would be the most important source of news. Yet theatre survived, as did radio during the TV era, and cinema has continued to thrive despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745 percent since 2008. 
Newspapers were once considered new media, but it took several centuries for them to become the main source of news. This change happened because producing timely news for a large audience became possible and affordable in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railways, and the telegraph. It was also important that people began to understand that everything around them was constantly changing and that they needed regular updates – a concept that was not common in medieval times. 
In the past, people mainly noticed the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease, which they could not predict. Life was, as writer Alain de Botton describes, ‘cyclical’ and ‘the most important truths were recurring’. Before the 19th century, journalism as a profession where one could earn a living hardly existed. Even then, there was no clear reason why most people needed news regularly, whether daily or weekly. 
In some ways, the regular publication of newspapers can be a limitation. Online news allows readers to choose when to read based on the urgency of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms help us personalize news according to our interests. When major stories happen, online news providers can give updates almost instantly. Mistakes and misunderstandings can be corrected quickly, and there are no space limits for stories, allowing for more detailed analysis. 
This is very different from the restrictions of newspaper publishing. However, many news providers do not seem to recognize the internet's potential for spreading knowledge and understanding. Instead, they focus on being the first to report news, increasing reader comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In the medieval world, news was often shared in busy marketplaces or taverns, where truth competed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be returning to that situation. Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works. They may face extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic world, newspapers will find a way to help us understand and gain wisdom."""
91,C1,"""If humans truly felt at home under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, just like many animals that are active at night. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genes, even if we don’t think of ourselves as daytime beings, just like we don’t think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This is the only way to understand what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by filling it with light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also brings problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 
Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and rhythms that many living things, including us, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects many aspects of life, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding. 
For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city in the world. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no public gas lights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. 
We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. There are many nocturnal species among mammals. Light is a strong biological force that attracts many species. The effect is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by searchlights or gas flares, circling until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange hours because of artificial light. 
It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Unlike astronomers, most of us may not need a clear view of the night sky for our work, but we do need darkness. Ignoring darkness is pointless. It is just as important for our health as light is; changing our internal clock can lead to health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological reflection of the regular pattern of light on Earth. These rhythms are so important to our existence that changing them is like changing our center of gravity. 
In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. Living in our own bright world, we have disconnected ourselves from our natural and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a real way, light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the scale of our existence, which is best understood against the backdrop of a dark night with the Milky Way above us."""

The founder of a large international company recently said that his business would stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a happy email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change seems like a way to make a possibly unfair policy sound better. 
Is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, such as finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work schedules. In a big company, it can be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business. The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel sure that their work and their team are up to date. But is it really possible to be that sure? 
No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works; you pause your work, but it keeps building up. Employees who follow these new guidelines might not take any leave at all, or they might feel guilty about taking time off. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers do not take enough leave, it could lower their productivity over time. 
There could also be pressure from coworkers and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. This pressure can already affect when people start and finish their workday. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a place with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If workers feel they cannot take the leave they need because they might seem lazy, they lose the safety that comes with having legal rights to time off. 
This policy might create a situation where employees do not feel they can take their entitled leave, or they might still use their legal rights as a guide, making the new policy useless. Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which makes it hard to separate work from personal time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees asked how it fit with the old way of tracking time off. If the company cannot track how much time employees work, why should they have a different standard for time off? 
However, a problem with having no set working hours is that every hour could feel like a working hour. Employees might not know if their working hours are being watched by their employer, which can make them feel like they have to monitor themselves, leading to negative effects. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid annual leave because rest and leisure are important for their mental and physical health. The benefits of unlimited leave, like better morale and creativity, can happen without sacrificing worker well-being. Therefore, I am not sure if allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is really the goal or the likely result of this policy."

Journal-based peer review is the process of having experts in a field check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. It is believed to help prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure the trustworthiness of published research? The answer is both yes and no. 
The current state of scientific publishing is changing. While I still believe in journal-based peer review, I see that things are shifting. The increasing use of preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review, is an important part of this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new results so that others can read, critique, and build on them. 
Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which has changed the motivations of authors and reviewers. The competition for publication in top journals encourages scientists to do their best work, and these journals publish a lot of excellent research. However, the rewards for publishing in these journals can lead to shortcuts, where important data is left out to make the research look better. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, this can depend on how timely or newsworthy the research is, rather than just its scientific merit.
These issues are well known, but many people are hesitant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints could help solve these problems without completely changing the system. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they have not been widely accepted. This slow acceptance is partly due to scientists being cautious and partly because of the belief that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.
Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors know that they will be open to critique and discussion from a global community of reviewers. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shares her experience: “My paper critiqued a published paper, which is not well handled by traditional journals. In their anonymous peer review system, the original authors might block a critical paper, or if they are not chosen as reviewers, they might complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their feedback. All comments are public, so readers can judge the quality of the arguments. The risk of rejection by journals is less of a concern since we still have the preprint and public comments, so our work is not wasted.”
Preprint archives allow informal scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also be a good way to share negative results, which are often overlooked by journals that focus too much on new discoveries. Additionally, being on preprint archives increases the number of times papers are read and cited, showing the effectiveness of sharing research this way. By using the internet’s culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the work itself, rather than where it is published."

When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" Their answers usually do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it. The first paragraph was a scientific description, and the second was from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 
**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The item? An oxygen mask – an unusual choice that helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and good discussions.
When I was in school, poetry often confused me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand and feel. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying.
What do we hope to find in poems? Isn’t a poem a place for deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music is hard to beat with its mix of lyrics and melody. However, one useful thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life is full of uncertainty, unlike reading sentences one after another. But these thoughts still don’t explain what a poem really is.
If you search online for ""poem,"" it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is fine for English professors, but it misses the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who makes things. So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – unpredictable and untameable – or to machines – precise and human-made – depending on their views. But these comparisons often break down when examined closely.
The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both. It can help us see ordinary things in a new way. Poems can be mental objects, especially since song lyrics often stick in our heads. The mix of words and melody has power, just like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? 
Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, right in front of you: A poem can impact you like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article or story, but it is not usually made to be sold. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not just a product for the market; it exists for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
