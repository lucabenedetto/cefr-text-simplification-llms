Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are, including some you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience, which can seem exciting: wealth, fame, and more. But as we share personal stories and photos, we might find ourselves in a crowded and dangerous space online.

This situation might seem sad, but there is hope. A long time ago, a group of early internet users, known as online pioneers, explored these challenges. They faced many problems, like losing jobs and friends, long before social media existed. These pioneers, who we now call bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through today. It is important to learn from their experiences.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web, which was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a chance to share his own life. He created a personal website filled with stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, and many people were interested in his adventures as he explored this new way of sharing.

Hall was open about everything; if you crossed his path, you could end up on his site. While some might see this as attention-seeking, there was also a unique beauty to his work. However, one day, visitors to his site found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the problem of sharing online remains. Sharing online can be fun, but if you think it will make people want to be with you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they would never say in person. However, the internet is not a separate world where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and pretending otherwise can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she later got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is popular among ""mommy bloggers,"" and her writing helps support her family. Once known for her online mistakes, she has learned to share her life carefully. What Armstrong teaches us is important: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."

Some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we do not understand. How can any scientist argue with that? Scientists can sometimes be a bit arrogant, but even the most confident physicist would not say they know everything about the universe. Still, some scientists felt they needed to warn the public about the film, calling it things like ‘atrocious’ and ‘very dangerous’. This made me curious to see the movie.

At first, I did not understand why there was so much excitement about it. Various scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. However, when the film talked about some of these discoveries, I began to see why people were interested. One claim was that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people around it. But the movie only showed pictures of ice crystals that looked nice after being talked to by happy people and ugly after being exposed to angry people. 

Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is clear and easy to understand. However, scientists often respond with skepticism. They want more proof. The idea that water can be affected by thoughts is amazing, but we need solid evidence to believe it. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. 

The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, some scientists say that water molecules have properties linked to a mysterious energy that seems to come from nowhere. This energy is connected to a force that is making the universe expand. The evidence for this comes from many years of research in labs and observatories around the world. 

Discoveries are being made that show the universe is stranger than we ever thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy’. 

On a more everyday level, scientists have made amazing discoveries too. Neuroscientists found that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they actually occur. We do not notice this delay because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Despite what some people think, science is not finished. In fact, we seem to know less than we thought. Many natural events cannot be understood as we once believed. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the best theoretical physicists are trying to create a Theory of Everything, which would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. 

In the end, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"Text: ""In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both types of writing help each other, creating a beautiful landscape that I love. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My pattern is this: after I finish a novel, I want to write short stories; after I finish a group of short stories, I want to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while writing a novel, and I never write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing use different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my beginning as a short-story writer.

One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to get a short story into good shape (though I can revise it many times). It’s not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. For me, writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change of pace.

Another good thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas – a thought, a word, an image, or anything. It’s often like jazz improvisation, where the story takes me where it wants to go. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This gives me comfort. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I have in writing short stories. In this way, short stories are like a testing ground for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment in the way I like within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult.

My short stories are like soft shadows I have placed in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."""

Science is a way of understanding the world. It can help us cure diseases and improve our lives, but it can also create problems. Science tries to explain everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe. It has influenced many areas of life, including art, politics, and philosophy. Sometimes, people do not understand its dangers or importance, and they may either overestimate or underestimate it. 

The history of science is full of disagreements. Old ideas are often changed or replaced by new ones. Just like in music, new ideas in science can be laughed at before they become accepted. Scientists can be very competitive, and jealousy and anger are common feelings among them. 

This book will focus on important scientific ideas that have changed how we think. While science has practical uses, we will mainly look at its ideas and their beauty. We will also remember that science can be limited and that our understanding can change. 

Science is always changing. There is always a scientist who is proving another scientist wrong. Most of the time, these changes do not affect society much. However, sometimes, big changes can challenge our beliefs. For example, in the 1600s, scientists began to see the universe as a giant machine. Later, new discoveries made us question this view. 

Some people think that the changing nature of science shows that it cannot explain the universe. But often, these changes help us understand and predict nature better. For instance, Isaac Newton explained more about the world than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. 

Science can make mistakes, but it keeps moving forward. At the end of the 1800s, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then, new ideas like radioactivity, X-rays, and quantum mechanics changed everything. Biology has also made many discoveries. 

Today, some people believe we are close to finding a complete explanation of the universe. Science is not just a fun activity; it has real effects on our lives. In the last 200 years, we have gone from simply observing nature to controlling it in some ways. This has sometimes upset the balance of nature. 

Everyone needs to understand science because it affects our future and the world our children will live in. The decisions made in science can impact many important things, like health and the environment. Science is now a key part of how we think about and shape our future."

Since around 2015, after many years of growth, big publishers started to say that ebook sales had stopped growing or even decreased in some cases. This raised questions about the future of ebooks in the publishing world. One publishing executive even said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, making his company lose faith in the value of printed books. 

Even though it seems clear that ebooks and printed books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. Whether people want to predict this or deny it, the idea that books might disappear continues to spark our imagination and create strong discussions. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and printed books as a fight, even when evidence shows they can coexist? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our feelings of excitement and fear regarding change and new technology.

In my research, I have looked at how the idea of one type of media replacing another often happens when new technologies are introduced. Even before digital technology, people predicted that new inventions would end older forms of media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear. However, radio found new ways to be used, like being listened to in cars and on trains.

The idea that books might disappear is not new either. As early as 1894, people thought that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has happened many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been said to threaten printed books at different times. Some people believed that the end of books would lead to a decline in culture, while others thought that ebooks would bring a better future.

The idea of books disappearing often comes up during times of technological change. This idea reflects our mixed feelings of hope and fear about new technology. To understand why we feel this way, we need to think about how we form emotional connections with different types of media, which become important in our lives. Many studies show that we can feel close to objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops.

When new technology, like e-readers, appears, it doesn’t just mean economic and social change. It also makes us rethink our connection with things that are part of our daily lives. As technology changes, we often miss what we used to know. This is why industries grow around older products and technologies. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for the older style. The same happened when photography changed from analog to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. 

E-readers have also made people appreciate the physical qualities of printed books, even their smell. This should comfort those who worry about printed books disappearing. However, the idea of disappearing media will continue to be an interesting story about how technology changes and our fear of change. One way we try to understand change is by using familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings. The story of the death of the book is easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world – and ultimately, ourselves."

For a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday morning. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time. I wanted to understand how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By writing about the everyday details of their lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to show a different side of their personalities and careers. 

The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I believe, “Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.” This book is not just about the creative work itself, but about the daily habits that help people be creative. It is also personal. The writer John Cheever said that you can’t even write a business letter without showing something about yourself. 

I have my own questions: How can you do meaningful creative work while also making a living? Is it better to focus completely on one project or to work a little each day? When there is not enough time, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not have all the answers, but I want to share how many successful people have faced similar challenges. 

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary, but it can also help you use your time, willpower, and optimism wisely. A good routine can help you stay focused and avoid being affected by your moods. The psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, he was a procrastinator and struggled to keep a regular schedule.

This book started because of my own procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, I was at the small architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story that was due the next day. Instead of working, I was cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a “morning person,” so I can focus well in the morning but not in the afternoon. To feel better about this, I began searching online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them. This led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day and now this book.

The blog was simple; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I have gathered more detailed and researched information while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog interesting. I have let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. 

I want to thank the many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work helped me. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will help you find more to read."

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big loan, said that their planned holiday to Spain was not possible anymore. Instead, they rented a small house on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was not interested in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. Instead, he was fascinated by the very beginning of life on Earth. He studied small creatures found in grey rocks.

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would get a job. He felt confident about his abilities, but he knew that hard work does not always lead to success. The process of getting a job in academia can be difficult. When the Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied, but he did not expect much.

On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview happened without him, and the professor who replaced him did not like Howard’s former professor. This new professor helped Howard get the job. Howard was surprised and grateful, but later a colleague explained what really happened. Howard felt a little disappointed. He wished he could think that he was chosen because of his skills, but he was just happy to have the job and do the work he loved.

Howard often thought about how organized his work life was, where he could plan and follow through, compared to the chaos of his personal life. Many people can affect your life, and sometimes a stranger can change everything. This happened to Howard when his briefcase, which had his lecture notes, was stolen at a train station. Angry, Howard went back to the college, called to explain, and postponed his lecture. He reported the theft and then went for a coffee. There, he met a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied, which would be a big challenge for him and help his career. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Text: Charles Spence will eat almost anything. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. They may look like maggots, but they have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. One of the challenges Spence and his team are working on is how to make eating bugs acceptable. Through his studies on how our senses work together to create flavor, Spence is quietly influencing what we eat and drink. This includes the products of big food companies and the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink in detail. Many factors affect taste, such as who we eat with, how food is arranged, the color and weight of plates and cutlery, and background noise. Spence’s book, The Perfect Meal, co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting facts about food. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant enjoys their food more? And we eat about 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others. 

Spence’s lab in Oxford is simple and not high-tech. He has soundproof booths that look like large safes, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who cannot pay for research. Much of his work is funded by a large food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less important in universities. But now, since the government wants universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research is considered valuable. Spence is helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. It is important for these companies to help their customers live longer. Surprisingly, many companies have been making these changes quietly, so customers do not notice. ""Research shows that when you tell people what you are doing, they focus on the taste and often do not like it as much,"" he says.

Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a big food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was strange, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal helped change this view. Together, they created the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in Blumenthal’s five-star restaurant. Interestingly, Spence notes that artists from the early 1900s were already experimenting with sounds and food, but it did not become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence’s research on the senses in many products. For example, higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. ""It is surprising how shapes can affect taste, or how a song can change how you feel about a flavor,"" he says. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released an app that played music while your ice cream melts, but they did not match the music to the taste, which often happens according to Spence.

What are dinner parties like at Spence's home? Once, they had rabbit with the fur around the cutlery. Another time, they played with remote-controlled, colorful light bulbs. ""We’ve had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and ten different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international food conferences are all part of his research."

Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false information, and rumors that we must sort through to find what is important and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more things ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us find items in stores. Now, we do most of these tasks on our own. We are trying to manage many responsibilities, like our families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. These devices have become part of our busy lives, where we try to fit as much as possible into every free moment.

However, there is a problem. Even though we think we are multitasking—doing many things at once—this is a misleading idea. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another. Each time we switch, it costs us mental energy. We are not like expert jugglers; we are more like people trying to keep many plates spinning, worried that one will fall.

Even though we believe we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It can increase stress hormones in our bodies, which can make us feel confused or foggy. Multitasking can also create a craving for constant stimulation, making it hard to focus. The part of our brain that helps us stay focused can easily be distracted by new things, like shiny objects that attract our attention.

Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. He showed that the mental losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking can send information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information may not be stored properly, making it harder to remember later.

Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to answer a text message or ignore it. Making decisions is hard for our brains, and small decisions can use as much mental energy as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can end up making poor choices about important matters.

In discussions about information overload, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not that email itself is bad, but the huge amount of messages we receive can be overwhelming. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does, he said, ""He answers emails."" His father agreed that this was quite true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it often feels impossible to do that and accomplish anything else."

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right way to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought these questions were not important. Animals had behaviors, and science studied those behaviors. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and morals was seen as silly. But this has started to change. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has appeared in some popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s *Wild Justice* and Victoria Braithwaite’s *Do Fish Feel Pain?* This has started a debate that may never be answered: do animals have consciousness? This debate leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong that guides their behavior? 

In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we produce and eat beef? While the observations are clear, how we interpret them is not. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote *Second Nature*, believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is close to a big change in ethics, similar to the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should rethink how we view animal intelligence. He says animals likely have a simpler understanding of the world than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop attributing human feelings to animals. These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since it is very hard to define consciousness, can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? 

Balcombe describes an important experiment he did that seems to show that starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with plenty of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. But when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a strong opinion. He says, “We look back with disgust at a time when there was racism. One day, our view of animals will be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” 

If Balcombe were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar ideas. Manning has written a textbook called *An Introduction to Animal Behaviour*. He says, “What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. In the early 20th century, some people thought animals thought just like us, and then there was a reaction against that. Now we are moving back to the idea that animals have feelings. But this is a complicated topic, and we should be careful about listening to academics with strong personal opinions.”"

Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., believes that arguing can help us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it also changes how we solve complex problems and makes it harder to think clearly. West says we are often exposed to poor thinking and popular opinions that can confuse us. Even though we have more information than ever, it does not always lead to better knowledge or decisions. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading literature, and this decline is getting faster. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, thinks that focusing more on visual media, like videos, may hurt our critical thinking skills. She says we are more focused on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing. However, we still do not have a clear answer about how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology has changed how we think, and it can have both positive and negative effects. For example, a computer game might help us think critically or make it harder to do so. Reading online can improve our analysis skills, but clicking on many links can distract us from deeper thinking. Greenfield has studied how learning and technology interact and found that reading helps us think and use our imagination better than visual media like video games and TV. Reading develops our imagination, reflection, and vocabulary. However, she also found that some visual media can help with processing information. Unfortunately, most visual media do not give us time to think or reflect.

As a result, many young people may not reach their full potential. How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. The debate about video games and thinking is a clear example. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, says that many people believe video games are bad for kids. However, he argues that they can be a good learning tool. Evidence shows that playing video games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in fun, virtual environments that are similar to the real world. These games also allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life. 

In today’s digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to look more closely at technology and understand how it affects our thinking and analysis."

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic and a writer. He chose this job after feeling unhappy with office work and social policy jobs. His first book talked about the good things about manual work. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. He got the idea for this book while shopping. He saw advertisements on a credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. Crawford realized that it is hard to avoid these distractions. What we think about at any moment is personal, but we often cannot choose this because of things we do not notice. It is becoming harder to think or remember conversations. People try to avoid being interrupted, so they stop talking to strangers. Crawford says, “We see the world through things that are made for us, like video games and apps.” These things reflect our desires and take over our attention.

Crawford is not alone in his worries. Many office workers complain about emails but still check them in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to focus. There is no clear evidence yet that our attention spans are shorter, but people are more aware of other things they could be doing. Some think this problem is caused by technology, but Crawford believes technology helps us focus too much on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control ourselves, which affects our social lives. People prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. Crawford argues that by only interacting with screens instead of real people, we might lose something important in society.

He gives an example from his gym. There used to be one music player for everyone, which could cause disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds. “The gym used to be a social place, but it has lost that,” he says. Real connections often happen when people have different opinions and work through them together.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world better. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real things. No video can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under a motorbike. These activities require good judgment and the ability to interact with others.

Crawford says, “When you engage with the world this way, fake experiences seem less important.” He does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use your judgment. There are many benefits to this, including feeling satisfied with your work. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and make it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, paying attention to one thing can help you pay attention to others."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. It is okay to say you study or teach philosophy, but calling yourself a philosopher might make people think you believe you know some special truth. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. 

One reason people think this way is that philosophers often judge what others do and celebrate thinking. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) said that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, is the best kind of life. Many modern philosophers do not agree, but philosophy is still seen as connected to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" This means that simply accepting what society says can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not mean you have to read many philosophical books or spend all your time thinking. It just means paying more attention to the everyday experiences that shape our lives. You do not have to be a wise person living away from society to do this. In fact, examining our lives can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is important for a good life.

Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more separate from real-life experiences, especially for those who do not have formal training. This is not only the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are often linked to expensive academic journals. Because of this, philosophers have little chance to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. For many people, philosophy can seem far away from reality. While some philosophers used to challenge this view, many have stopped. The university system has created a situation where academics are isolated, and they often support this separation. As philosophy has become focused on very specific debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand, and even more so for those without training.

This trend needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I mostly work in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully describe my work because ethics is often seen as related to formal rules and laws. There is a new way of thinking in ethics that looks at the fairness of specific social practices. The job of an ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I think about often.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading movies is unethical (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people think more deeply about the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we might find out something we already knew; other times, we may realize that our beliefs are hard to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we can do something good for everyone."

People who love food, like foodies and chefs, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, discussions about food have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers talk about eating, they usually use it as a way to discuss something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, conversations about food seem to be about food, but they often explore deeper ideas that are not directly related.

One interesting philosopher is Epicurus, who believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. His name is now often connected with enjoying food and drink. You can see his name in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites. These businesses likely hope to attract customers by linking their products to famous philosophers.

Food is also social and cultural. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with our communities. These communities help us find people to eat with and provide the means to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more than with any other product, making it a good topic for philosophical discussion.

Once food is ready, critics start to talk and write about it. But why do they have such a special role? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, good food critics are just better at describing flavors. This area has not been studied much, as most research on perception has focused on sight. 

Another important part of food is its beauty. We often talk about paintings or music being beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, because of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed as art, like sculpture or poetry. However, food is eaten and gone after we enjoy it, unlike art that can last over time. So, it is not correct to think of food as a true art form.

There are also many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? The answers often show our beliefs about what is right or wrong. Philosophers will always question why we choose certain foods, and discussing these issues is important.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone shares food and time together. In contrast, professional cooks have duties to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more like colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we can learn to appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food; second, we can build friendships with people from other cultures by eating together. This practice has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy enjoyable for everyone."

Rob Daviau is from the US and he designs ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. This made him think about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect the next game? He changed a classic board game called Risk to create a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have a lasting effect. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and players’ past actions become part of the game. Daviau said: “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Later, Daviau was asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very well received, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world.

Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story from falling apart. To do this, they use play-testers to see how the games work. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. The first few games might be great, but then after a few more games, it can start to break. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was developing the idea, he thought it would only appeal to a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was really different and pretty good, but it’s unexpected and breaks many rules. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest improvements in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, excitement, and intensity.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the fun of an unfolding adventure was more important than worrying about how long the game would last. He mentioned that people don’t usually watch the same movie twice in the cinema. “You’re buying into an experience,” he said. “It’s like the storytelling you find in video games.”

The legacy format is inspired not only by video games but also by popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer, but he moved into advertising and then game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but you also need more than just an outline.”

Daviau feels proud of his work but is curious to see how others will use the idea. He thinks that soon gamers will be asking, “What’s new?” Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is not so sure. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."

Not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared a lot online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think that animals are similar to us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart and look very different from humans. 

Octopuses can do amazing things like open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play games. Some scientists think that saying animals are like humans is not scientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that not recognizing the human-like traits in animals is the real problem. He calls this ""anthropodenial."" 

Dr. de Waal has studied animal intelligence for many years. He found that, except for having a fully developed language, animals show many behaviors that we thought only humans could do. These behaviors include remembering the past and future, feeling empathy, and understanding what others want. This means animals are smarter than we usually think.

In the past, people believed that animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world, said that the difference between human and animal minds is just a matter of degree, not kind. 

In the twentieth century, many scientists started to see animals as simple machines that only respond to rewards and punishments. This view made people think less about animals’ inner lives. This change happened at the same time that humans were harming animal habitats and not caring for livestock properly. 

Dr. de Waal believes we are starting to understand animal intelligence better now. He says, “The times are changing.” He points out that we are learning more about animal intelligence, especially with the help of the internet. 

To test animal intelligence, scientists should consider the special skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we fail, it might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is not sure that Inky really found his way to the ocean. He thinks it is too hopeful to believe that Inky knew how to escape. However, he understands that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate animal intelligence. 

He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (which they like) and others received grapes (which they like even more), the monkeys with cucumbers got very upset when they saw the others getting grapes. This study was published in a scientific journal, but what really made people believe it was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our minds work in unique ways. 

**Questions:**

1. What did Inky the octopus do at the aquarium?
2. Why do people enjoy stories about animals like Inky?
3. What are some things that octopuses can do that show their intelligence?
4. What does Dr. Frans de Waal think about how we view animal intelligence?
5. How did views on animal intelligence change in the twentieth century?
6. What example does Dr. de Waal give about how different animals have different skills?
7. What did Dr. de Waal find out about capuchin monkeys in his experiment?"

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now changing our world in a big way. Robots have been used in car making and factories for many years, but experts say we are about to see robots used in many more areas. They warn that many countries are not ready for this big change. 

Many people think that robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows that we feel safe about our jobs, but we might not be. Every industry will be affected by robots in the coming years. 

For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This job would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is a robot called Tally, made by a startup in San Francisco. Tally moves around supermarkets to check that products are in the right place and priced correctly, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robots say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means there will be new jobs for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, some people worry that we should not forget the importance of human skills at work. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come from using fewer human workers.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots will change jobs in the future. His recent report says that in two years, almost one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work with other robots and humans safely. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will still be open because there are not enough skilled workers.

Zhang says that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes these workers need to find ways to retrain themselves instead of waiting for the government to protect their jobs. He says that people cannot expect to do the same job for their whole lives anymore.

New technologies will also create new types of robots for consumers, like robots that can walk and live in our homes and interact with us in smart ways. This is a great chance for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy. 

With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis coming, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future with robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is said to have answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it’s there."" This answer shows a common feeling: many people wonder why someone would want to do something so dangerous and seemingly pointless. Some may feel inspired by his answer to follow their own dreams, as it encourages people to face the unknown. However, the main point is that climbing can simply be about adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different climbing activities, from playing on small rocks to climbing high mountains, each with its own rules. He believed that the way climbers approach a climb, like how much equipment they use, depends on the rules of that specific activity. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and conversations.

Many climbers love climbing because it gives them a sense of freedom. However, climbing can also feel very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a contradiction in climbing. But some argue that having fewer choices can make a climber's life simpler, which can also feel like freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of our nature; we are born to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it is risky. The joy we find in climbing is more about our biology than logical thinking.

US academic Brian Treanor also wrote about climbing, saying it helps develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He believes these qualities are especially important in today's world, which often avoids risks. Climbing can help us grow and live better lives outside of climbing.

Another idea is that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by saying that climbing alone is harder and riskier, so these achievements should be recognized more than those done with teams or with help like bottled oxygen at high altitudes. Some worry that this view might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also look at climbing from a different perspective. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""going with the flow."" The physical effort of climbing, the focus needed while climbing, and the intuitive problem-solving are all key parts of the experience. Some argue that climbing is similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which helps people find peace of mind. This idea adds another layer to the question of why people are drawn to climbing."

For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a well-known figure in classical music. He was serious and thoughtful, focusing on important European piano works. He wrote and performed a lot, but he did not teach many students. People who knew him saw a fun side to him, but he rarely showed it during concerts. His life was a busy mix of studying, traveling, and performing.

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He remembered a famous pianist saying, “You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” However, he was impressed by Kit, who was about 14 years old. Brendel listened to him play and said, “He played very well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a recital he had done, and I thought, ‘I need to make time for him.’ His performance was amazing, leading you from the first note to the last. It is rare to find a musician with such understanding and skill.”

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to become more known. Brendel is careful, worried that Kit might burn out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother watches over him. He also composes music. Brendel says, “This is very important. Learning to read music is easier when you try to write your own. I noticed that Kit has an incredible memory and can read music very well. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and understands what I explain. When I tell him something to do in a piece, he can do it everywhere in that piece.”

Brendel becomes serious and says, “I don’t want to raise expectations. I get upset when newspapers do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century, which is not good. It can cause problems. Like many talented young players, he can play some pieces very well, but others need more time and practice. It would be unfair for a critic to expect perfection.”

Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed in his life after performing. He explains, “When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I turned 50, I felt I had done most of those things, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Even though I don’t have the same physical strength now, I still have many ideas in my mind and pieces I have never played. I don’t perform now, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.”"
20,"Text: ""When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic covering broken glass. 

At home, my father was often quiet. He had a sense of humor and liked to say funny phrases, like ‘It’s immaterial to me.’ He could have said ‘I don’t mind,’ but he preferred the word ‘immaterial.’ Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. 

My father was good at fixing things around the house. He could build bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once, but my mother liked to change the furniture often. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I couldn’t play, she simply said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or river – I always chose the river. I could imagine another world there. With a fishing net over my shoulder, I would walk along the riverbank in my old sandals, looking for a good spot to take them off. I would leave my sandals with my picnic and carefully look for fish in the water to catch. After some failed attempts to keep the fish alive in the backyard, I returned them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as I could, but it seemed impossible until one day my father said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, my dad surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think he saw my interest in gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening himself, he had watched me enjoy it and noticed my passion for plants and flowers."""

Lawrence MacEwen is crouching down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am doing the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic is trying to blow us away, over the steep cliff at our feet and into the ocean below. Then, MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and his owner gently pets him. The strong wind cannot make MacEwen uncomfortable here on his island, where he feels at home. 

MacEwen is showing me around his neighborhood. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s big mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

Suddenly, MacEwen says, “I have sheep to move,” as rain starts to come our way. We walk down the slopes. As we walk, he tells me about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. 

While herding the sheep, Tie, the sheepdog, is not doing a good job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” means the dog should go to the right. Instead, he goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says sadly. “That will never do.” The dog looks ashamed. 

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence works the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they are hungry.” 

But life on the island has some challenges. For example, electricity is only available sometimes. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary preparing breakfast with a flashlight. I also have to deal with no mobile phone service. “There is phone reception on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone away.” So I do the same. 

Everything on Muck seems surprising. The boat today brings some groceries and three musicians, who get off the boat with their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with the islanders tapping their feet to the music. 

That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay in a newspaper and bought it without looking at it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know how to run a farm? “She had good typing skills.” 

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and give it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is delicious. 

The next morning, I worry about my ferry ride to the next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the last two months because of high waves. If my ferry does not come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days. And secretly, I wish for that to happen, phone or no phone."
22,"Text: 'The game design industry was once mostly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals. It did not offer many ways for people to enter the field. Many people thought of video games as just a hobby for young fans, but now the industry is taken seriously. This change may surprise some, but experts in the field are not surprised. However, getting into the industry is still not easy. Video game spin-offs that come out quickly after a new movie need many team members and a lot of skill and hard work. Like many industries, it can be hard to get in, but it is growing. 

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, ""It is very difficult to make progress in big companies or to influence major games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just the top-level directors who manage a whole game, but also the lower-level designers who create systems and individual parts of the game."" 

So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim has a different opinion. ""There is only one way: make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed on your own if you are not making things. Game design is more than just a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real.""

Another expert, John Field, sees other options. ""While just doing it is important, it is more complicated than that. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s requirements today. Even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and business sense to really help the industry grow."" 

Can you succeed on your own? ""Maybe, but it is quite difficult,"" says John. ""A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide support and guidance for a year or two. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and have a strong interest in the arts and modern culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but have realized that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in the field. 

Finally, making connections is important. This is often forgotten, but to succeed in games, as in many other areas, you need to network."" The old image of a young boy playing video games has changed. Now, video games are seen as a serious medium that attracts many people. Families often play together on interactive consoles, and smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. ""Games have become popular for larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this area as full of new possibilities and opportunities."""

I had a friend who came to the park with us, but his dad was very strict. He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and has not played football since. I am glad that did not happen to me, but I know things could have been different. When I score a great goal from far away, people often say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was a kid. You can only score amazing goals by practicing. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned the right techniques. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills. I played many sports at school, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but football was all I thought about back then. The teachers were doing a good job, but I did not notice it at the time. I do not want my son to be like that. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that he just wants to kick the books around and not that he takes after me in that way. 

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made big sacrifices so that some younger players could play for the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He did not call us together and say, ‘This is your big chance,’ but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us realize how much we had to work. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I depend a lot on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people say to me, ‘I can’t believe you let your mother keep working.’ I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong people, and I think they would be upset if they thought they should be paid by me. My mum does not earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to help the people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think, and it does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing, I want to take a year off or even longer to do things I have not been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I break a leg while skiing and cannot play football again, I would not be insured."""

Reef Point did not get many visitors. The road was not very nice, and a better resort, La Carmella, was nearby. Most people chose to stay there instead. Only those who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people were at the beach. After being alone for months, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy every day trying to finish a script, and he was very stressed. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty started to follow me. I tried to send him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he didn’t really want to hurt him. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, ‘Who does he belong to?’ My father replied, ‘He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and liked to dig things up and bring them to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a beach towel, and I had to return them. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim faster. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon playing in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers.

Are you visiting?’ I said, ‘No, I live here.’ She asked, ‘Is your father American?’ I replied, ‘No, he came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.’ She seemed surprised and asked, ‘What’s his name?’ I said, ‘Rufus Marsh.’ She then said, ‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded.

""What have I done?"" Violet Hetherington asked herself. She was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton. The line was spilling out of the building marked ‘Departures’ as people waited to board the Queen Caroline. ""It’s best to get to the docks late,"" her friend Annie had told her. ""If you get there too early, you can get bored waiting."" Annie, who was married to a diplomat and traveled a lot, usually gave good advice. But this time, she was wrong. 

After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. The mood among the waiting passengers became worse. Some tried to be patient, and a few even tried to be cheerful, but most people were unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted it to be special. Violet felt like leaving. She checked her bag for her phone and realized it was missing. This was more annoying than the long wait. It made her feel that going on a cruise was a mistake. 

Now, she couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she left her phone in the taxi because all her numbers were in her phone. This was the mistake her older son Harry always warned her about. Behind her in the line, there was a friendly-looking couple. ""I’m sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make a call?"" Violet asked. She called Harry using the couple’s phone and left a message for him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it wasn’t there, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, ""Thank goodness,"" but she didn’t tell Harry this. 

Harry thought he was more experienced than his mother. Daniel, her younger son, was more understanding of her mistakes, but that was because he made them too. Dan might forget to give the message to Kristina. Eventually, the line started to move, and Violet went to a window where she gave her travel documents and got ready to board. 

Her heart sank when she entered the ship’s lobby, which looked like a fancy hotel that was trying too hard. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, shiny brass, and carpets that looked like those in airports. Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators,’ which were full of mirrors and crowded with tired passengers. They might have preferred not to see their reflections. Violet was pressed against the side of the lift as it went up, stopping at each floor to let people out. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out and felt free. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had asked for. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to make sure she had a good view of the sea."

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was starting to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures to use in a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing interesting moments. Since then, Maloof has collected many items related to Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. 

One morning, Maloof looked around at everything he had. He felt he was close to discovering something special, and it happened by chance. “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,” Maloof said. “I could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They spoke to local families who had hired her as a nanny and talked to people at the shop where she developed her film. 

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and had a unique style. She often wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, she would have her camera around her neck and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “I remember her as a private person but she had strong opinions about movies and politics.” 

Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Although she was not very social, she liked to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist and followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “She didn’t let anything stop her.” 

Maier’s work is a pure form of art; she did not create it for money. Her images often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. “What is interesting about Vivian is that she has so many fascinating pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style. “Was Vivian very skilled or did she take ideas from those before her?” 

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I learned more about photography and looked back at her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to share her name and get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"

When people say a novel is ambitious, they often mean it might not succeed. But this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, *The Luminaries*. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she seemed calm, especially for someone in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass. The official looked at it and asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author.

*The Luminaries* takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s. A series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men has come together to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past gave her more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is more than 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she replied that it feels nice to come from a small country because everyone feels part of the success. She said, “There’s a very familial feeling at home; I got a lot of back pats from other people’s grandmas.” She also mentioned that it annoys her when people think her book is not serious.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, where each part is half the length of the one before it. The story speeds up as it goes along. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if readers cared, they could find them.

Even with its unique structure, *The Luminaries* is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, Catton said she didn’t plan the story in advance. “I would try to write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be to get out of that situation,” she said. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also talked about her love for television dramas. I asked if she would be interested in writing for TV. She replied, “That could be pretty cool.” She spoke with excitement and laughed softly. She lights up when discussing her writing and New Zealand. “I notice when I come to Britain how much my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for busy cities to be around more people.” But for now, New Zealand will still be her home. I hope it gives her the inspiration she needs for many more novels."

When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has been building acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny says, “I still love the guitar. It amazes me that you can make a beautiful sound just by putting two pieces of wood together. Different types of wood make different sounds, and that still surprises me.”

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. He says, “Some people would get a job to save money for one, but I thought if I wanted something, I should make it myself. I studied guitars to understand how different shapes and types of wood change the sound.”

The bass guitar was the first instrument Jonny built himself, but he and his brothers had been making model boats and planes for a long time. Their father taught them how to use tools like saws and chisels. Jonny also repaired instruments for his friends. His bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a career at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he decided to study architecture at university because it involved design, which he liked. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out because he felt it wasn’t right for him. He realized that building guitars was a type of sculpture that involved creating sound, and he thought it would be a better career than pure art because people actually use the things he makes.

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time to earn extra money. At first, he sold his guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a good guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is “still scratching a living.” He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the beginning, he worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals on weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments because he didn’t think about money much. Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. He says, “When I started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good. UK-made guitars were not seen as real, even though we have always had good courses for making instruments. Now, our hand-made guitars have a good reputation.”

Jonny thinks new instrument-makers should take courses to learn valuable skills. However, he also believes that learning by trying and making mistakes is important. He says, “You should look at other instruments, see what works and what doesn’t, and try different things. If you make the back of a guitar too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you learn from someone else, you might only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.”"

When we talk about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a common tradition, and many writers mention the famous saying by Dr. Johnson, an 18th-century writer, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This saying is still true today, just like it was over two hundred years ago. However, many people stop here or try to explain why the English are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They think that when we talk about the weather, we are really interested in it. 

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not interesting at all. He points out that in England, we do not have exciting weather events like tornadoes or big storms that happen in other places. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that even if we do not have tropical storms, living near the ocean means we can never be sure what the weather will be like.

I believe that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather itself. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, when someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to start a conversation or fill a pause. 

Talking about the weather is like a form of social bonding, similar to how monkeys groom each other. There are specific situations where we use weather talk. Some people think that English people talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. We usually use weather talk in three situations: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a pause in the conversation. 

Because of this, it may seem like we talk about the weather a lot. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to more weather talk, and return to it when there is a silence. This is why people from other countries, and even some English people, think that we are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Text: Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. She could not find a suitable historical novel to help her explain life at the Wall during Roman times, so she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started her new career as a writer in 2001. 

Alice felt that writing was a big change for her. She said, “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very tiring. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it is not so exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my stories.” Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. She noticed that many books for teenagers focus on negative experiences or are completely fantasy, like Harry Potter. She wants her books to be different.

Alice always taught English and History together, using stories like the Tale of Troy to make lessons interesting. She loves to see when a child goes from being bored to being interested. “I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to make them engaged,” she said. She sees her writing as a way to continue teaching. 

Alice was inspired to write her first novel because she saw a need for it, but she also felt a change coming as her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. “I had been teaching for 25 years, and I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I didn’t think I needed.” Before she could join the course, she had to send in her best piece of writing, which she only learned a few days before the deadline. “I sat down and quickly created a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.” After three hours and 30 pages, she sent it in and was accepted.

During the course, other students reviewed her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards to show her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and his help was very important for her writing. Alice said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I believe we help each other. He works with what I write – he reads a chapter and changes the sentences, and if something doesn’t work, he suggests new words. I tend to add more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor.”"

To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would have Jonny in a car and Alistair on a mountain bike, racing against each other in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. They would race to the same finish line. Jonny was excited and said, “I’ve never done anything like this before! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I can stay warm in the car.” Alistair, the younger brother, was also eager but dressed in warm cycling clothes. He joked, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway!”

The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would finish at Fleet Moss, which is the highest road in Yorkshire, about 350 meters up. This would be easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill at the beginning. They quickly shook hands and started the race. Alistair rode away on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and drove off. The question was, who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence quickly dropped when he faced a big problem. Just 15 seconds into his drive, a giant tractor came onto the road. He complained to the cameraman, “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving. Meanwhile, Alistair was having a hard time with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, while sheep watched him curiously. Finally, he reached the top and was ready to go faster.

In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The roads in Yorkshire are old and narrow. He had to drive slowly around a tight corner and through a small stream on the road. Once he got past the last village, he could drive straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close they were to each other. Jonny sped up as he approached Fleet Moss, while Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road.

As Alistair reached the finish line, he suddenly stopped and asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in celebration and shouted, “Yes!” A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in his car and got out. “Well done,” he said, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.” 

**Questions:**

1. What was the purpose of the race?
2. Who was in the car and who was on the bike?
3. Where did the race start and where did it finish?
4. What problem did Jonny face while driving?
5. How did Alistair feel when he reached the finish line?"
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all make you feel separate from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. What I find hardest in a tennis match is to focus only on the game and the point I am playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me, or the millions watching around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing with my friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not so hard. I was just happy to be there at twenty years old. Federer beat me easily, but my loss in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have done better; it was not my skill that failed me, but my mind. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, my tough coach, usually does not comfort me, even when I win. But that time, he told me there was no reason to cry and that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand; I thought it was my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments are more important than others, and I had let a big one slip away in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to help me feel better. But he was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat; this time, my mind would be strong. The best sign that I was ready was that I believed I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we did not talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to, but they understood that I was already thinking about the match in my mind. From then until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: 'In early April 1957, a young and hopeful Englishwoman arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always wanted.” Her name was Jane Goodall, and she would spend most of her life in Africa. She became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, the National Geographic Society in Britain helped make Jane Goodall famous by publishing articles and making television documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including popular children’s books and the 1971 bestseller In the Shadow of Man, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her personal life rather than her work. She has been seen as a girl seeking adventure, a privileged woman who wanted to be with wild animals, and a strong woman in a man’s world. These images do not fully show what she has accomplished. 

Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading scientist in her field because of her research, the success of her students, and the large amount of data she collected over her forty-year study. She helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people thought wild chimpanzees were very dangerous, and they misunderstood the risks involved. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or that they used tools, like humans do. We also did not realize that chimpanzees have emotions similar to ours or that their social lives are much like ours. Goodall discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have their own unique cultural traditions. Her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), is the most important work in this field and is the first encyclopedia on chimpanzee research. Her long study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals, and because chimpanzees are our closest relatives, she also changed how we think about ourselves.

Even as a child, there were signs of the person Jane Goodall would become. One clear sign happened in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, Jane disappeared, and her family called the police to help find her. After a long search, she came back alone, with straw in her hair and clothes. Her mother asked, “Where have you been?” Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she crawled into a henhouse, hid in the straw, and stayed very still for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey to becoming a biologist.'"

In our first conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voice of a funny 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an amusing old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says. “I had to learn how to say many medical terms quickly.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors think they can do funny voices, and some really can,” she says. “But it’s more than that. You have to make the script exciting for an audience that can’t see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceover work, but they often don’t get the parts because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley took a drama course, hoping for a regular acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a big part.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and thought voiceover work might be a good path for her. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors often provide the voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter than male actors. Hiring child performers is complicated, and production companies prefer to avoid the long process. Shirley has learned to create different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. 

Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I’ve learned that smiling while you talk makes your voice sound happy.” When she works on animation, it feels like a holiday because interacting with other actors is enjoyable.

The competition for voiceover work is strong, and having a good showreel – a recording that shows what you can do – is very important. “It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her profession through hard work as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel or practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending special workshops that cover all types of voiceover work. She also thinks it’s important to love human sound, saying she is obsessed with voices and becomes the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, it can take over me, and I’ll speak like that for hours or even days,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in many different voices.”"
35,"Text: 'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people give up these dreams and think about more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, like the doodles in school notebooks, seems silly. But some people do it. 

Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ‘the kid who draws.’ I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, and they bought them. In a few months, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be many more cartoonists. The skills needed to be a cartoonist are not hard to learn, but it is still a tough job. You should only try to be a cartoonist if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have of making a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I take on all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But those days are fading. Now, cartooning is often a business where you have to create and sell your work. The more comfortable you are with selling, the better you will do. I have seen cartoonists with average drawing skills but great business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack business sense.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon and are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it can actually be a lucky break!'"

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar from Japan. I usually hate getting rid of things, so why did I want to throw this away? I took it to the dump and was about to put it on a pile of trash when a young man came up to me, looking confused. “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” he asked. I said I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said “Yes.” After that, I felt sad about what I had done.

A few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean. Ten years later, he found it in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I read an email from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He said, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since the young man at the dump took it. Keith found my name and address on a label on the guitar. He used my name to find me online and contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy I almost cried. I would have given him anything, but his price was fair. I had forgotten that my dad always put name labels on my things, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this strange story!

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound bad when a beginner played it. But I didn’t make much progress, so I switched to the electric guitar and played easier songs. This was also the time of punk music, when people who couldn’t play well could still be rock stars.

When I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are played that way. My fingers knew what to do. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands just moved. My fingers felt the special pain of pressing down the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really meant for solo playing. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"

There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book *Insomniac*, about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and feelings. Anyone who has trouble sleeping will tell you that sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social health. People who struggle the most with sleep often understand how important it is. It is good that sleep is finally getting attention. But what about dreams? I have not heard much about dreams in this discussion. We are losing dreams all the time. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss the last hour or two of sleep, and this lost sleep is mostly REM or ‘Rapid Eye Movement’ sleep, which is when we dream the most. Our most vivid and powerful dreams happen mainly in the REM stage just before we wake up in the morning. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, so a person who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM sleep. When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they find that the next night, those people have more REM sleep to make up for it. This shows that dreams are important. 

When researchers found REM sleep in 1953, many agreed with the famous psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams was the best way to understand our minds. However, later studies about the brain did not support this idea. Now, researchers focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. According to Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold, there is very little agreement among dream researchers today. 

Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study that showed actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams much better than other people. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person’s interest in being creative. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only creative people the ones who can use their dreams? Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? 

Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams may help us see new patterns and create combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They “ignore the obvious and put together things that make a kind of crazy unexpected sense.” This is what creativity is, according to Stickgold. I find that I write better when I wake up from intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely remember, seems to help me think better. On those days, the words and ideas come out so quickly that I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t know how it works, but it does seem to help. 

But creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and we all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea and many empty frames on the walls, along with smiling photos of her two daughters. Susie is a well-known copyist artist. She can copy famous paintings from the early 20th century, like those by Impressionist artists, and also works from the 16th century, like Caravaggio. It is surprising that she does not keep any of her own work. “I don’t have any of my own around,” Susie says. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” 

Susie is very popular. In her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted many famous artists’ works, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts sometimes think they are the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions of pounds, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she spends on them. Susie does not reveal most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors love art, but others want to show off their collection. One famous buyer likes to say he owns a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s up to them.” Some collectors keep the original painting in a bank safe and show Susie’s copy in their home.

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she tries to make it look as real as possible because she believes it is important to respect the original artist. However, she signs her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real painting, and even though she knows people who have done this, she has never wanted to. People who make fake art often get into trouble. Susie is not rich and has had difficult times, but her life is more stable now, and she does not want to risk her good reputation.

Susie did not always copy paintings. After finishing her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She earned very little money for several years. Looking back, she thinks this experience helped her learn important skills and gave her a love for plants, even though it was hard to live on that salary. She had to be very accurate and get things right the first time. She has no regrets about that job, but she is happy to have found something that pays better.

When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and represent things accurately. She also emphasizes how much she has studied to do her work. Her training allows her to draw plants, make perfect copies of 15th-century paintings, and reproduce 20th-century abstract art. Now, she focuses on French Impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas being her favorites. 

Susie believes that many people think modern art is easy, almost like children’s art. However, she explains that Impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very careful. This combination is harder to achieve than people think. Given her skills, it seems strange that Susie does not create her own art. Isn’t art about expressing yourself? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She explains that her work comes from years of training and hard work, and she makes a good living from it. She has tried to create her own art before, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. They were fine, but not better than that. It’s like living on simple food after enjoying meals made by a great chef. Susie is a perfectionist."

During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest person on it. She loved sailing since she was a child. Her boats were very important to her; they felt like a part of her. When she was back on land, everyday life seemed unimportant. People wanted to know about her races, but she just wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had been dangerous for her.

After she finished second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She took me into the tiny cabin where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even how many rolls of kitchen paper she would need. Preparation was very important to her. She proudly showed me her food supplies, a small gas stove, and medical supplies. She took great care of her boat because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: a small, beautiful thing that can be damaged and is running out of resources. A turning point for her was a trip to South Georgia, a lonely island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey of albatrosses. This experience made her think differently about the world. She noticed many abandoned whaling stations and felt it was a warning. She realized that people often take what they want and move on.

When I arrived at Ellen’s office, she was finishing a conference call. She explained why we need to act now to save the planet. “We are not making coal, oil, or gas anymore. They are precious resources that we have only once. We need to find ways to not use everything up,” she said. At first, her message was to use less, but she later found a more positive way to think about it. Now, she talks about re-using things, like reusable carpet tiles.

For the last three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. “I will never be an expert,” she says. “But I love learning new things. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Sailing now feels selfish compared to this work. It’s about finding how I can be most helpful. It really matters.”

She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about and create a sustainable future. “I do miss the adventure of being at sea,” she says. “It is part of who I am. You feel connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on the race, on practical things, on survival. My new message is not as simple as saying: ‘I want to be the fastest person around the world.’ I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I have ever done.”"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his time. He hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and explore, instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just part of their plan. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he becomes a teenager.

I spoke to some famous climbers who have climbed Everest, and they do not think it is a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the mountain. They believe that while a young climber might be strong, they may not be emotionally ready. They also think that a young person might not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing safely. The Romero family has heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can’t focus on it – we have a lot to do. I think about possible problems, but I believe our experience as climbers will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it just his father's dream? Paul says, ""This project is not about me becoming famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it."" When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal.""

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is seen as a chance to break records. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This creates a problem for Jordan. Some people say that focusing on achievements can take away the fun of the adventure. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to use social media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it is likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually do not know who he is. I have just started a music degree, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers. If you do not know who created the music, you probably do not have any recordings of it. This is sad for fans of classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies. This is hard to believe. So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I do not think this is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I do not really enjoy classical music. I like many styles, but according to my computer, I listen to classical music about as much as that 3% figure. 

So, why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many changes, can be hard for us. We like to talk, play, and think quickly. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Also, pop music talks about things that interest teenagers, while classical music often does not. 

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I do not know why more middle-aged people like classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it. Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they play it, but it is not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” said Bonnie, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” said her mother. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do so. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she said to herself. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway,” she thought, “so why not get it over with?” She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a large area for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one in sight. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall was full, and she walked along, looking carefully at each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she told a small pony, gently touching its nose. The next horse caught her attention. “But aren’t you the best of the lot!” she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He seemed lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “It was in my dreams, and I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride the horse. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. It can’t be far.” The room with the riding equipment was – to Bonnie’s delight – unlocked. While she was busy putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she could see. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed happily as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said, “and I mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know about much else.” She nudged him into a walk, then into a trot. “If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,” she said. She went around and around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, with a little breeze brushing past her cheek. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"Text: ""I have met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up on stage in front of thousands of fans? ‘I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven,’ Cody says, remembering how it all began. ‘But I was swimming and surfing every day. Those things were more important to me back then; I had a busy life. When I was 13 and in high school, I posted a few videos online.’ These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans left comments asking for more videos. So Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The responses were amazing. Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on his sport. But then record labels contacted him, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the chance. ‘It was very hard for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 years old and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?’ He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ‘It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,’ he says, remembering their shocked faces. ‘I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world.’ So Cody packed his bags and went with his family to the other side of the world, giving up one dream to try to make another one come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and is not directly involved in his career, they support him. Cody says it’s important to have a close group of good people around you to stay grounded. Of course, everyone has days of doubt. ‘Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, “How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?” My little brother is eight years old, and he travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,’ Cody admits. ‘I worry about how that affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.’ Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big chance, even when it’s a little scary. ‘It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,’ Cody says. ‘Now, I am going to countries I never thought I would visit and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s something many people dream of. But I know it won’t last forever.’"""

I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags last week. I had worked with most of the adults in town for long hours to help. My grandfather didn’t seem to notice. 

With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the stretch of dark water from the factory in Milltown. There was fragile ice on both sides, and solid ice further down. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It is better than having a famous grandfather because only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip, which I keep under my pillow and read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen. 

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom smiled as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious because of my wetsuit. He always sees me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa can be hard to deal with when he gets angry. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came in with a kind smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I wanted to say he has always been like this, but I tried to be nice to him. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, even though he is grumpy. 

Mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even in this cold weather!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my expedition.” 

She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Text: 'Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her into the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s, but it looked different from his other work and was not finished. “Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” Jess looked closely at the painting. There was a river in it, but it was not a river she recognized. It seemed like a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was very small, with just a hint of green that was easy to miss. The eye was drawn to the pale waters, leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people in the painting, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant scene. Still, Jess felt drawn to it, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: “River Boy.” The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” “Exactly. It’s strange, isn’t it? For him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later since he hasn’t finished it yet. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” “Mum! You should have known better.” “I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.” Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would have said, “It’s not the artist’s job to explain a painting. Each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. Painting is hard work without having to explain it to everyone.” “He said ‘ignoramus,’” Jess added. “If artists had to explain their pictures to everyone who asked, they’d never get any work done.” Mum laughed and said, “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.” “Inspire?” Jess asked. “Yes, someone who gives an artist ideas.” She knew what it meant. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint, but he usually meant that the muse was not helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse. He never said the muse was about her. She always thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as strong-willed as Grandpa. “He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He’s been painting all his life.”'"
46,"Text: 'When I woke up this morning, I didn’t mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand, the blade might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I didn’t plan to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up and think, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me a lot. 

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s very cute! It is small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in there. I keep my collection of shells and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was so happy when she gave it to me! 

The problem is, it is a corner cabinet, so it has to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it is the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one belongs to me. Mum says that when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be stuck in my small room for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the way the roof slopes down and the window is at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimeters off the bottom of it... That was when I had an idea. If I couldn’t cut anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this “lateral thinking.” I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to “think outside the box.” And that was exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"Text: 'The novel ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn’t want to be told I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans', which made filming more difficult. 

The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be ten times further away than usual. When filming the human world around the Borrowers, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to show the Borrowers' view. They went through many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for some aerial shots. 

One big challenge was getting the shadows right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very surreal. I remember asking them to carry a giant pair of scissors, and they really got into it. The coins were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift, which made the crew laugh a lot. 

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t need to act. It was important to me to get the costumes right, which has been a problem in other TV versions. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they looked like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the leading actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail with the costumes!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I drew 2,000 by the end. They weren’t perfect, but they worked well enough. We didn’t have enough money for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series was successful in showing the magic of the books.'"
48,"Text: 'Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, expecting to see journalists, but there aren’t any. I know that soon there will be attention on me. It always happens. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything will be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school because I want to meet regular kids. How about a kid whose mom works in an office or a dad who mows lawns? That would be so cool and normal.

I walk into the school’s main office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I tell the school secretary. “Name?” She looks very unfriendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary seems confused. “Oh,” she says and types “McGraw” on her keyboard. That’s good because not many people recognize my last name since my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” the secretary says. Then she rips the paper and hands it to me. English Literature, first period. Great, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. But I will be late. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly searching for my classes.

When I get to the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with flowers on them. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses. “Desert... McGraw?” she says carefully. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we look at them and she tells us about the books we will read this year, she actually lets us talk! All teachers should understand how important this is.

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have many choices. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a recording studio so close to the sand? “My dad had to move,” I tell her. Yes, lies work better. “What does he do?” she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out soon anyway. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care much. Great.'"

Today, American teenage girls are expected to do a lot. They should be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in school. Being a teenager in America means you cannot just go to school and be average; you need to be ambitious. Many adults forget how much pressure teenagers face today. They have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and they also want to have a social life. Teenager Kristen Loose says, “We have so much to do!”

Even with all this pressure, teenagers still face negative stereotypes. People often think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, and only care about themselves. While some teenagers may fit these stereotypes, many do not. Kristen Loose believes that people wrongly assume teenagers spend all their time on their phones and watching TV. She admits she often has her phone nearby, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. Teenagers use their phones to help with schoolwork and stay connected.

With smartphones and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they can listen to language lessons. Schoolwork now takes up a lot of their time, even outside of school. Many teenagers wake up around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often stay up past midnight. They have a busy schedule filled with school, activities, family responsibilities, and homework. They usually get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. A survey found that only about 20 percent of American teenagers get enough sleep, and 28 percent said they fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. She does not spend her free time on social media or TV; instead, she focuses on volunteering. She believes that many people think teenagers only care about themselves, but she enjoys helping others. “I look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community,” Olsen says.

In the future, the stereotypes about teenagers may change, but they will continue to prove people wrong and make a difference in the world. There will always be new generations of students who are ready to take on challenges before they finish school."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a small mountain town in the US. This town is mostly surrounded by wild nature, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, this group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project that is also an adventure, which is why many teenagers join. I visited them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to try to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and creates a bright light.

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a device to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check the temperature as the balloon rose. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to help find it later. A gas tank, given by a supporter from another state, was used to fill the balloon, which slowly grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get the gas tank. “I didn’t really mind,” he said. For kids in this club, that is normal.

Finally, it was time for the balloon to lift off. “Five, four, three, two, one,” they counted down, and the balloon started to rise. Some of the teenagers ran and followed its path with bright flashlights until they could no longer see it in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch for shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky, which was surprising because it was only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” said one girl quietly. “I know,” whispered another. A meteor flew across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, and the balloon got bigger until it popped with a loud noise. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recovering the lunch box is a big part of the program,” said the group’s leader. They have only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “This journey helps us learn more about the landscape in a way we usually don’t.”

This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students know the Eastern Sierra well,” their leader said. “What seems wild to some is just normal for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not record any shooting stars. This was a bit disappointing, but it gave them a chance to discuss how atmospheric waves work above mountains. It was also another adventure story to share with anyone who asked."

Chloe Morgan admits that she was not very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. “My younger brother was really into dinosaurs, which I didn’t care about at all. I helped him with a science project, and when I read an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology, I was amazed. I knew right away that I wanted to pursue this field.”

I ask her what support she received because Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people back then. “I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,” she laughs. “His name was Matt Cornelius, and he was already famous, even though he was young. I was very nervous, even though he was known to be friendly. I worried he would think I was just a kid bothering him with questions. It could have been awkward,” Chloe says. “But I felt better when he showed patience and listened to me.”

I bring up how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe thinks for a moment. “I have to say that films like Jurassic Park, which use special effects to show dinosaurs, have made many people interested in these creatures, but not necessarily in Palaeontology itself. While I appreciate this interest, I think the few palaeontologists shown in movies are often not accurate. It bothers me that we are often seen as strange geniuses or awkward people who can’t talk to others. Movies do not show the real life of palaeontologists.”

I ask her to explain her job. “My work is very varied. I spend a lot of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also work long hours in labs, studying fossils and writing for scientific journals. Sometimes, if I have time, I also explain scientific findings to the public. I take this role seriously. There are many misunderstandings about science, and while some of my colleagues do not want to focus on this, I believe it is important. I want to connect with young people because it is essential to share all parts of science. Talking about dinosaurs can excite children about nature and help them understand other areas of science.”

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She explains that the creators of the show knew what they were doing, and she was there to give advice if needed. “I had an easy time because there was not much I needed to change, like making sure the dinosaurs were the right size and shape. I mostly checked that the dinosaurs shown lived at the same time. We attracted audiences of all ages because we have learned so much about dinosaurs recently, and the ones in this program are very different from those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are the most realistic dinosaurs ever shown.”

I ask Chloe why she thinks dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and why research on them continues. “I think they appeal to our natural curiosity. We are drawn to the unknown and the idea of discovery. In a world that feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still much to explore. Palaeontology is like time travel.”"

I will say this once: when you are traveling by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not “there yet,” even when you keep asking, “Are we there yet?” The truth is, once you arrive, it is not “there” anymore; it is “here.” So if you think you might be “there” already, you should ask, “Are we here yet?” I am sure that no one wishes to be “there yet” more than the parents who hear that question over and over on long car trips. 

Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles you have not finished, while the beautiful views go by outside the window. In the front seat, there is mum or dad, who gives out juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio station, and makes sure everything runs smoothly. 

“Are we there yet?” I hope not. But then someone in the car does something annoying—usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he is all over my space, and a fight starts. The driver and co-pilot have to reach back and separate us while the car moves fast. They tell Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This helps for a while, and we can enjoy the beautiful scenery again. 

Then, I try to read, but I feel a draft on my arm. The window is closed, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is not doing anything wrong. This makes me angry. Tim gets yelled at again, and the car swerves. But slowly, things calm down. 

Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask, “Are we there yet?” he often says, “Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.” But we are still on the highway, going fast. Then he says, “Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.” This keeps us quiet for a bit. 

You can tell when you are finally “there” when the adults get out of the car and go far away from the kids who have bothered them for so long. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You are not there yet."

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee and cake while playing board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using their phones and other devices. She believes that people should be together and talk to each other.

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. Everyone stays involved and feels part of the game until the end.

Later, cooperative games were created, where all players work together to win or lose as a team. One popular cooperative game is Pandemic, designed by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players must work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the book of the same name. He remembers feeling scared and excited while playing it with friends. He wanted to create a game that gave players those same feelings.

Leacock has loved board games since he was a child. He enjoyed receiving games as birthday gifts, but often felt disappointed when they didn’t meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he started to redesign games to make them better. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up game included a lot of storytelling. Leacock says it is like an electronic game because players develop characters and the story changes as they play.

The growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games too. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone has at least one game on their phone. 

In the past, video games allowed people to play together in the same room, but now many games are played online, making it harder to connect with others. Because of this, some people who enjoyed video games are looking for ways to play games with others in person again. 

At John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just fun. In our online world, games are now something to share directly with others, and this trend is likely to continue."

Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that hard work and determination are very important in the music business, even if your career starts slowly. He says his mother was a great singer and helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio he listened to at home was a local station for older people, which influenced his music taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the music room at school learning songs on the piano. He said, “I was doing well in tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for my whole life. It was just too much hard work.” At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not want to make a career in music. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to pursue music, saying he had been writing lyrics during economics lessons and playing the piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend. Eventually, he became more successful as a songwriter than as a performer. After a tough time with a record label in the UK, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. He did not become famous right away. He said, “I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of my career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he found success. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists. He sometimes has to explain to artists that wanting to write popular songs is okay. He asks them, “Don’t you want 10 million people to listen to your music next month?” He wants to help them create songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well. It is nice to hear someone in pop music talk openly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he knows he wants to write number one songs and that he has a talent for it. Instead of trying to please others, he focuses on his work. He says, “When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim to write the best music for next year. It’s not just about what’s popular. We want to create classic modern pop songs.”"

Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing tricks on bikes. He is a ‘street trials cyclist.’ This means he jumps from hard places like roofs, walls, or rocks to land safely in other strange places. He films these stunts and shares them online.

On the day I interview him, we meet in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids all know who he is, and some older people come to tell him he’s ‘an absolute legend.’ After watching him perform, I agree with them. At first, I was a bit doubtful, but I am impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him, he seems a bit uninterested and sad. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to connect with fans. He says, “I see the value of talking to fans, but I prefer to just do things.”

This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that help create the videos. He says, “This technology helps people like me earn money.” He feels that many people are always filming themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t always agree with that.

Tony makes a good living from his videos, which is different from the past when similar activities were just hobbies. After many years of interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two important things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent and help someone keep going even after failing. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength is needed.

Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy but new challenges. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded. Some people do not see him as a hero. They think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He says, “People who say this may care, but they don’t understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t see that I get advice from experts to reduce risks.”

Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some are never scared, and they shouldn’t do these sports. It’s smart to know the dangers. Others can’t get over their fear, but I can. I feel fear but find a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning. Sometimes I ride around for a while to get ready before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus completely, then I’m okay.”"

For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, just a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she already had some circus skills, she found out that high-wire walking was very different. ‘The training was a shock,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then I did an hour of exercises, and another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could keep going. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterwards. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ However, this experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing, an old-style bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. He had already written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and also used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.” Jeff did not want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. He thought the most unusual bike would be a penny farthing, so he went to a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more surprised people were by his bike. His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to go home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"

This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we don’t know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we know very little about their night activities because we didn’t have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear pictures, even on nights without a moon, so we can learn more and make better choices about how to protect their habitat. 

It is hard work. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has not been easy – some nights are warm, but most of the time it is wet. It is very quiet, so I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special snow vehicles.

She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching balls, and even fire. It also includes trapeze, where performers fly through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to do different things all the time – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always work on improving their skills. 

People often think that circus performers get hurt a lot or that they only work for a short time each year. But the real issue is thinking about the future because you can only travel and perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many past students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that it’s not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but a lot of fun!”'"

I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are long enough already.”

She thought carefully about her options instead of just choosing the first idea. When she decided to sell satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie said, “Many people said there was no demand for them – but I was sure.” She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a job but was good at business.

Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term. 

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, called Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her feelings. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was happy when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics.

Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join his company. At first, she was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. But Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. All the tickets sold out quickly, and it was a wonderful evening.

Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times in life rather than happy moments because she feels she has more to say then. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him unhappy. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her.'"

He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. I had always wanted to visit this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe.

The guide said that very few people live along that coast now, and the only other living creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t know. It was nice to forget about how fast or slow the day was going. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all cooked together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life! When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life?

You might think that watching so many matches would make me love basketball, but it did the opposite. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the practice, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real match.

My parents came to watch, which made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t too different for me. In the end, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""
67,"Text: ""Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I trained to be a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This meant taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised to find out how much I enjoyed giving those tours. I got to see the city I had lived in my whole life through the eyes of tourists, and it felt like a new experience every time! After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I researched what I needed to do, I learned that to get a license as a full-time tour guide, I had to know a lot more than I had learned so far. All Chicago guides must be able to answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. 

Tour guiding isn’t just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. There are many other important skills. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and most importantly, you need to react to changing situations. For example, if a place you thought was open is actually closed when you arrive, or if the route changes. Tourists don’t want to hear about problems or that they are missing something; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know that these reviews are very important because good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. For me, the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job mean that my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."""
68,"Text: ""My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we had nothing to worry about. 

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we did not have much space. We chose to do this because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both do not like. 

After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I think she might be a little upset with herself for not enjoying her time there more because she missed her friends. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"""
69,"Text: ""My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different customers, not just people buying for friends or their homes. Hotels and offices often buy flowers for their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we did. 

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love what I do. It is often cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were buying for myself, I would probably only choose pink flowers because it is my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like may not be what other people want. 

Sometimes, I cannot find the flowers that customers want because not all flowers are available all year. I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it is part of my job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. 

Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then we create flower bunches and calculate the costs of the orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That is what you have to do when you sell things – I wouldn’t want any other job!"""
70,"Text: ""My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films and many films for kids on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – I wanted to talk about a film in detail with a group of people after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We are happy to make enough money to cover our costs – we are not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can also see how many tickets we have sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say they had a great time, it feels wonderful. The website has been very helpful, and we are now in contact with other film clubs across the country. We have visited other places to see how they do things, but it is always nice to return to our own club! We have also started a blog because we know that most people look online for information about films instead of reading local papers. We have tried putting up a few posters in cafés, but nothing is as successful as people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we have with each film – last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""
71,"Text: ""Taking photographs was always my favorite activity when I was a child. When I turned 15, I wanted to make my hobby more special. So, I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked how I saw and took photos. I also enjoyed photographing many different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. I agreed and started to focus more on taking photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing, as they mostly took color photos. Because of this, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up. In the end, I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and that I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my choice of career."""
72,"Text: 'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new things like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new skills. There are levels from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made great friendships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week and I always look forward to it. 

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before starting at the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!'"
73,"Text: ""I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a ski resort in the mountains, which is about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly fell in love with the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for competing and winning has grown as I got older. This helps me to work harder. I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I could do the jumps that got me this score until I tried. That success made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying when there is no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends then. This helps me deal with not being able to do what I love and what I am good at. I think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I also want to have another option in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I can find time to go to college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."""

One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for making me do that – it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try that. I never thought it would be so easy, as it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. Mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to know if they looked good enough for other people. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my items to take home. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but we were just two people at a market stall! That was when I knew it could work, and it was time to create a website. Since then, I’ve made a lot of money through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far.'"
75,"Text: 'When Janine Stuart was only 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became very popular. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview about her book, Janine said, “Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I learned how to make new friends. I know what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, fits in at a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I am my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.” 

Janine started her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to write. The year before, she entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was in bookshops. 

One review of Being Amelia says that even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the characters face some difficult challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer mentions that even though Janine is still very young and Being Amelia is not a long novel, she has shown that she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: “At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I know that if I spend time with my friends, I will soon have something interesting to write about!”'"
76,"Text: ""My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. It all started when my father was asked to be the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy because he thought this was a great opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school there. 

After we moved, we quickly got used to living on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment in it is nice. In the summer, the island is lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there are not many teenagers like me. The adults help each other and work hard to fix things on the island. 

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! But we often see amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then it can be bright and sunny again in just a few hours. It still feels incredible when that happens, even after living here for a long time. Of course, we do have terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But then I remember it has been here for hundreds of years, and it is still standing!"""
77,"Text: 'I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different bird species apart and where to find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we returned home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am almost there. On family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries, too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fun hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before I walked onto the stage. I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.'"

My family knew I often liked new hobbies but then stopped doing them, so they thought I would do the same with football. But I didn’t. I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a good player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13 years old. After that, I got much better. Still, some people were not sure I would ever be a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I thought I would! I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let the other players down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with a big crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to let them talk to other players in my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and encourage them to think they could play for a top team if they work hard.

In recent years, there has been an interesting change in education in the UK and around the world. Schools and universities are encouraging new students to get involved in research early in their studies. This shows that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists, but is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are important not only for studying but also for jobs, as they help us think about the world and how to do our work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat information; you create it. Making knowledge involves asking questions instead of just accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex and groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts. On the other end, research can be simple inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about different issues and practices. Most students have done some form of research before. You have likely asked questions and looked for answers in school or at work since you started learning. You have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training your dog, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, it is important to have a curious mind, identify problems, and critically explore information and ideas. You are expected to create your own responses and add to discussions. Some students may find this difficult because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning comes from listening to teachers and texts. It may feel disrespectful to question established knowledge, and you might think you should be told what is important to learn. However, in many places like the UK, US, Europe, and Australia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.

This process of inquiry and building knowledge can seem challenging. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research done by others is helpful for students and in the workplace, but we need to engage with it. We should not just repeat what we read as if it is always true. Instead, we should think about it, test it, and check if it makes sense and is supported by evidence. We must be careful not to accept information uncritically, whether it comes from reading or speaking."
80,"Text: 'Cities have always been important places for ideas and creativity. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were popular spots where people talked about science and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artist Pablo Picasso shared his thoughts on art. However, living in a city can be difficult. The same cafés in London that encouraged discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Today, cities are full of creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming and unnatural.

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are surprising. It has been known for a long time that city life can be tiring, but new research shows that living in a city can actually make it harder for us to think clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains because they give us a break from the busy city life.

This research comes at a time when more people than ever are living in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into concrete areas with many strangers around us. It has become clear that these crowded environments can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. For example, when walking down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people walking, busy roads, and confusing street layouts. These small tasks can tire us out because cities have so many things to focus on. Our brains need to constantly decide what to pay attention to, which takes a lot of energy.

In nature, however, we do not have to work as hard to pay attention. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature could help our brains recover. Natural places have things that catch our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and looked for ways to bring nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a chance to escape the busy city. A well-designed park can help our brains feel better in just a few minutes. While people have tried many ways to improve brain function, such as energy drinks or changing office designs, nothing seems to work as well as simply taking a walk in nature.

Given the many mental challenges of city life, we must ask: Why do cities keep growing? And why do they still inspire creativity, even in our digital age? Recent research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same crowded features of cities that can make it hard to focus – like busy streets and many people – are also linked to innovation. The ‘concentration of social interactions’ is a key factor in urban creativity. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, helps it succeed as a center for technology and creativity. On the other hand, less crowded areas may produce fewer new ideas over time.

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. Because there will always be times when people say, ‘I’m tired of nature; take me to the city!’'"

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to show this. However, I believe that studying the mind should not only focus on what is inside our bodies. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, that shows that objects, as well as our brains, are important for how we think. 

From an archaeological point of view, it is clear that tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing have played an important role in human development and the creation of our minds. Therefore, I suggest that what is outside our heads can also be part of our minds. It is easy to think of the mind and the brain as the same thing. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually use. This makes sense for scientists who study the brain, but it often ignores that much of our thinking happens with the help of things around us. 

I do not want to say that our thinking is not based in the brain, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It is better to explore the idea that human intelligence goes beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects can help us think, like when we make numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to create a tool. It also studies how these ways of thinking have changed over time and what those changes mean for our thoughts.

This approach gives us new ideas about what minds are and what they consist of by changing how we understand the role of objects in our thinking. For example, think of a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick helps us understand that minds and objects can work together. The stick helps the blind person feel their surroundings, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. 

The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can change a lot by using new tools. I see the human mind as something that is always changing and developing. It is important to remember that, no matter what form the “stick” has taken throughout history – from the first stone tools to the internet – its main purpose is to help us connect with the world, not to limit us. 

For humans, tools are used to satisfy our curiosity. This special ability to engage with objects explains why humans, more than any other species, create things, and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds can change and grow as we interact with the material world. I want to bring the importance of objects back into how we understand thinking. MET offers a new way to see how different tools, from ancient hand-axes to modern smartphones, have helped define and change who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, humans have been using it since the beginning of our existence."
82,"Text: ""Few inventions have changed our lives as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture. It was used in many ways: for practical purposes, science, industry, and art, as well as for fun and entertainment. Historians say that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the United States to the visual arts. No other art form has been as important in the US. This is a big statement, but it shows how photography has become central to American culture and thinking. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing interest in technology. People were excited about changes in their lives. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the sights of the world into people's homes in a very immediate way. 

Second, the camera became a popular tool for showing one's identity. It allowed people to create images of themselves for others to see, in a country where personal and national identities were always changing. Third, the camera helped families keep a record of their lives, even if those records were sometimes idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the trend towards realism in American art.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they are records of events, people, and things. They show what was in front of the camera, giving them a sense of objectivity. However, since each photograph is taken by a person, it also carries the photographer's point of view. 

When we see a photograph, we might think we understand its meaning, especially if we recognize the subject. This is why photography has often been called a 'universal language.' But the meaning of a photograph is more complicated than that. Objects, people, or events do not speak for themselves, and every image comes with some context that affects how we understand it. This could be a caption in a newspaper, a layout in a magazine, or its position in a gallery or book.

To understand a photograph in its historical context, we need to consider its purpose and function in its culture: Why did the photographer take the picture? How did people first see it? The same image can be viewed in different places and times, and its meaning can change accordingly.

For a long time, the importance of the camera to artists was not well known, but today it is clear. In recent decades, artists like Andy Warhol have used photographs in their work in many ways. In summary, photography has become an important part of art, working alongside painting and shaping our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."""
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. Everyone has a mental life, which means we have some understanding of our thoughts and feelings. Psychology can be studied in humans, rats, and monkeys, but it can be hard to understand completely. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements like thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not match scientific facts.

Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions on complex topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to provide methods to find the most likely correct explanations in different situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

Psychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind and brain. While psychologists study the brain, they do not yet fully understand how it works in relation to our feelings and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and making educated guesses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but we cannot observe the mind in the same way we can observe a machine. We can only see the mind's effects through behavior.

Studying psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. It requires careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical thinking. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to change the processes it studies. When psychologists achieve these goals, they can help us understand our experiences and apply this knowledge to real life. Psychological research has helped improve teaching methods, design safer machines, and support people dealing with emotional distress.

Although people have discussed psychological questions for centuries, scientific investigation of these questions has only happened in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at one’s own thoughts and feelings, to find answers. While this method is still interesting, it has limitations. Sir Francis Galton noted that introspection only shows a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than just their own experiences."
84,"Text: In a storehouse in a simple business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place that shows the failures of consumer products. This place is informally called the Museum of Failed Products. It has items that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has a sad story about the designers and marketers who created it.

What is surprising is that this museum exists as a business. You might think that any good manufacturer would keep a collection of their failed products. However, many business leaders do not want to think about their failures and often do not keep samples of their unsuccessful products. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. Starting in the 1960s, he began to buy every new item he could find. He did not realize that most products fail. By collecting all kinds of new products, he ended up with mostly unsuccessful ones.

Today’s culture of optimism may explain why many products end up in the museum. Each product likely went through meetings where people did not see that it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might spend more money on a failing product to try to make it sell better. Little effort is made to understand why the products failed, and people involved often choose not to talk about it again.

This focus on being positive is also common in the self-help industry. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which suggests that if you imagine good outcomes, they are more likely to happen. Some scientists believe that our brains are wired to see things positively, which may help us survive. Research by neuroscientist Tali Sharot shows that people with a healthy mindset often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events compared to those who are depressed.

However, how effective are these positive thoughts about the future? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied this question. Their findings are surprising: thinking too much about how well things could go can actually reduce people's motivation to reach their goals. For example, people who were encouraged to imagine having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our experiences with failure depend on our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed mindset"" believe that ability is something you are born with, while those with a ""growth mindset"" think that ability can develop through effort and challenges. People with a fixed mindset find failure very scary because it shows they did not meet expectations. For example, a sports star who thinks he is naturally talented may not practice enough to succeed. On the other hand, people with a growth mindset see failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles grow stronger when they are pushed to their limits, where they tear and heal. Having a growth mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who invest in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid enough, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games far away, like in the Far East, to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often think that the order of events explains what happens. For example, when a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the many times when their cheering did not lead to a goal.

There is one common belief among fans that science supports. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a famous study, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another group watched the same match in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in many sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, while today they win about 60%. One reason for this change could be travel. In the past, traveling was difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and if their hotel is not good enough, the club will find them a better one. Stadiums also look more similar now, which may affect the home advantage.

However, these explanations do not fully explain the data. Home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual players. In team sports like basketball, players need to work together, and playing at home helps build their confidence.

Another interesting point is about players' testosterone levels. Researchers found that players' testosterone levels were normal before away games but were much higher before home games. This increase may be linked to a natural desire to protect their home ground. In recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams won at home against stronger teams, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important to many athletes and their coaches. It is easy to understand why. First, there is some debate about who really said it first, as many golfers from that time have been mentioned. Second, the meaning of the quote is not clear. Player did not mean luck in a real sense; he was being ironic. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ 

However, there is a question about how much practice is needed to improve. This question is part of a bigger discussion about whether talent is something we are born with or something we can develop through practice. This discussion is not balanced; it seems that practice is more important than natural talent. The idea that practice is more important than talent comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that you can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. This idea has been popularized in books like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers and others that say talent is not as important as practice.

But, as Epstein discusses in his interesting book, this idea is not always true. He points out a problem in many studies about successful people: they often only look at those who are already excellent. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have certain skills while others do not. Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden and beyond, to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that in the toughest sled dog race, the drive and desire of the husky dogs may be very important. This suggests that both genes and learned traits can play a role.

Some people believe that commitment and determination are choices we make. But what if, as Epstein suggests with the huskies, a person’s drive is also influenced by their genes? This shows how complex the topic is. Epstein talks about the difference between nature (genes) and nurture (environment), and he believes that both are important for elite athletes. He does not ignore the role of training or environment. For example, he thinks that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in the world.

Epstein also looks at important issues like race and gender. He asks, ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""

A recent international report shows that many children living in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so sad? In her new book, *Kith*, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, looking at screens like televisions and computers. They have lost touch with nature, such as forests, mountains, and rivers. She believes this is a big part of the problem.

A follow-up study interviewed some children to understand their feelings better. The study found that many children do not want more technology; instead, they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, saying they enjoyed playing outside, swimming in ponds, and exploring. They think this was much better and healthier than the lives of children today. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have kept their children safe and indoors, worrying about dangers outside.

Griffiths discusses the fear parents have about letting their children play outside and how this fear helps companies sell toys and gadgets to keep children entertained at home. She also talks about trends like giving medicine to children who are restless or making them wear goggles during games. While it is unclear how common these rules are, Griffiths expresses her strong feelings about them. She also shares her thoughts on childhood freedoms and rules, from fairy tales to school regulations.

Although Griffiths makes interesting points, she sometimes goes too far. She compares how children are treated today to a form of racism, which seems extreme. She has a romantic view of children, believing they are naturally good and creative. However, this view may not match the reality of how children behave in groups.

One important idea in the book is that children should be allowed to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Also, not all children want to explore the wild as Griffiths suggests. What about children who are shy or prefer to stay at home? Perhaps the real problem is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether by keeping them inside or pushing them outside."

I am a bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not just because of my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or answers we memorize in school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play. 

My recent research focuses on how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Those who have more to learn tend to play more. For example, carnivores (meat-eaters) play more than herbivores (plant-eaters) because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates, like monkeys and apes, play more than other mammals because they need to learn more and rely less on instincts. Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can.

Play is a natural way for both adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling their emotions. Creativity is very important for success in today’s world. We do not need people who just follow instructions or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can help people think ahead and find solutions, we will have a strong workforce. But this requires creative thinking, which comes from a playful mind.

Adults we call geniuses are those who keep their childlike ability to be creative. Albert Einstein said that school almost took away his interest in math and physics, but he found it again after leaving school. He called his innovative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen next. 

We cannot teach creativity, but we can lose it through schooling that focuses only on questions from a strict curriculum, where there is only one right answer. More important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which they will need later in life.

Play is voluntary, which means players can stop whenever they want. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players know they must keep each other happy to continue the game. This ability to quit makes play a very democratic activity.

School has become harder: there are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. “Play dates” with adults have replaced unsupervised play in neighborhoods, and adults often feel they must step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact over time. They are caused by many social factors, including parents’ fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other.

Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."

In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers. This is different from the old way of trying to get noticed by standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, using social media can also lead to mistakes. 

For example, a young job seeker in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. But the executive was upset by his request. She refused to connect with him and sent a rude message that became very popular online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret how she wrote it. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could be helpful.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. This is surprising because social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could have long conversations online and then ignore the same person at school. With the right pictures and songs on Facebook, you could seem like a different person. 

But using social media for professional networking is very different. Some young people do not see this difference. They learned to be bold and confident online, which might make them think this is still a good approach. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers' expectations to succeed in their careers.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual in their messages and seem arrogant. This makes older generations think young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are worried about finding jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be good employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing some research or helping in another way. This can help you get a better response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone polite to make a good impression. Remember, social media can help you make important connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid being ignored."

Since 2000, the number of copies sold by most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by one-third to one-half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA says that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26 percent of US citizens, down from 45 percent in 2001. Many people believe that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. In 1835, a journalist in New York claimed that books and theatre were finished and that daily newspapers would be the most important source of news. But theatre survived, even with the rise of newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has also done well during the TV era, and cinema has continued to thrive despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales increasing by 745 percent since 2008. 

Newspapers were once a new form of media, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This change happened because it became possible and affordable to produce news for many people over large areas in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railways, and telegraphs. It was also important that people began to understand that the world is always changing and that they need regular updates. In medieval times, people did not think this way. They only saw the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life was seen as a cycle, with repeating events. 

Before the 19th century, journalism was not a full-time job that people could rely on for a living. Even then, most people did not see the need for news every day or week. The regular publication of newspapers can sometimes feel limiting. Online news allows readers to choose when and how they want to read, based on what they find important. Advanced search engines help us find news that matches our interests. When big news happens, online news can provide updates every minute. Mistakes and misunderstandings can be corrected quickly. There are no limits on space, so stories can be longer and more detailed. 

This is very different from the strict format of newspapers. However, many news providers do not seem to use the internet's ability to help people understand the news better. Instead, they focus on being the first to report news, getting more comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In medieval times, news was often shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be going back to that situation. Newspapers have not always been very good at explaining how the world works. They might be facing extinction. Or maybe, as the internet adds to our feeling that we live in a chaotic world, newspapers will find a way to help us understand and gain wisdom."""

If humans really felt at home under the moon and stars, we would walk happily in the dark, just like many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This fact is part of our nature, even if we don’t think about it. It helps explain what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by adding light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also creates problems called light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study.

Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design. This means that artificial light shines into the sky instead of down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night and changes the light levels that many living things, including us, have adapted to. When man-made light spreads into nature, it affects important activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding.

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city in the world. Almost a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no public gas lights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have smelled London more than you would have seen its faint glow.

We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but that is not true. There are many nocturnal animals. Light is a strong force in nature, and it attracts many species. Scientists say that some birds are ‘captured’ by bright lights, circling around them until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into tall buildings that are brightly lit, and young birds are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange times because of artificial light.

At first, it was thought that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Most of us may not need to see the stars for our work, but we still need darkness. Not having darkness is not good for us. It is just as important for our health as light is. Changing our natural sleep and wake cycles can cause health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a natural response to the light and dark on Earth. These patterns are so important that changing them is like changing our balance.

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. By living in our own bright lights, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural history – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the vastness of our existence, which is best understood under a dark sky filled with stars."

The founder of a large international company recently said that his business will no longer keep track of how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to be inspired by a smaller internet company that has a similar policy. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a happy email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, some people think that this way of announcing the change seems like a way to make a difficult decision look better. 

Is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other’s work schedules. In a big company, it can be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business. The founder said that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel sure that their work and their team are up to date. But is it really possible to be that sure? 

No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works; you pause your work, but it keeps building up. If employees follow these new rules, they might not take any time off or feel guilty about taking leave. Feeling guilty can lead to stress, and if workers do not take enough time off, it could lower their productivity over time. 

There may also be pressure from coworkers and gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. This pressure can affect when people start and end their workday. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a place with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If workers feel they cannot take the leave they need, they might worry about looking lazy. They would lose the legal right to take time off, which could make them feel stuck. 

Modern technology makes it easy to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, mixing work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance this new way of working with the old rules about time off. If the company cannot track how much time employees work, why should they have different rules for time off? 

However, not having set working hours can be a problem because it means that all hours could be working hours. Employees might not know if their working hours are being watched, which can make them feel like they have to work all the time. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest and free time are important for their health. 

The benefits of unlimited leave, like better morale and creativity, can happen without sacrificing worker well-being. Therefore, I am not sure if the idea of ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is really what this policy is about or if it will actually happen."

Journal-based peer review is the process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. It is supposed to stop bad or silly papers from being published, and scientists often talk about it positively in the media. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to make sure the published research is trustworthy? The answer is both yes and no. 

The way scientific publishing works is changing. I still believe that all papers should be checked before they are published, but I see that things are shifting. More researchers are using preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review. Preprints help researchers share new results quickly so others can read and discuss them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers. This focus can change the reasons why authors write and how reviewers do their jobs. Competition for spots in well-known journals pushes scientists to do their best work, and these journals publish a lot of great research. However, the rewards for publishing in top journals can lead to shortcuts, where important data is left out. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, this can depend on how interesting or newsworthy the paper is, not just on scientific quality.

These problems are known, but many people are not willing to change the current system. However, biologist Ron Vale recently suggested that preprints could help solve these issues because they do not require a big change from the current way of doing things. Even though preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they are not used by everyone. This slow acceptance is partly because many scientists believe that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing papers without peer review could lead to bad science, but this has not happened yet.

Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors know that their work will be open to feedback and discussion from a global community of reviewers. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience: “My paper was a critique of another published paper, which is not handled well by traditional journals. In their anonymous peer review system, the original authors might block a critical paper, or if they are not chosen as reviewers, they might complain about being misrepresented. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their points. All comments are public, so readers can judge the quality of the arguments. The risk of rejection by journals is less important because we still have the preprint and the comments available, so our work is not wasted.”

Preprint archives allow informal scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also be a good place to share negative results, which are often ignored by journals that focus too much on new discoveries. Additionally, being on preprint archives increases how often papers are read and cited by others, showing that sharing through preprints is effective. By using the internet’s culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the research itself, rather than where it is published."

When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" Their answers usually do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group of students to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph was to describe the object like a scientist, and the other was to be from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I am a device that helps people breathe. I am only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The object? An oxygen mask – a surprising choice that helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and good discussions.

When I was in school, poetry often confused me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we hope to find in poems? Isn’t a poem a place for deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music is hard to beat. However, one thing a poem can do is show us ambiguity, which is common in everyday life.

But this still does not tell us what a poem really is. If you search online for ""poem,"" it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as a type of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is fine for English professors, but it misses the word's roots. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is a ""maker of things."" So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it?

Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – unpredictable and untameable – or to machines – precise and human-made. But these comparisons can break down when we think about them closely. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both.

The idea of a poem as a mental object is not hard to understand, especially since song lyrics often stick in our heads. The mix of words and melody has power, just like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, looking right at you: A poem can touch you like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it.

What about the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten just like an article or story, but it is not usually made to be sold. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry books, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not just a product for the market; it exists for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"Text: 'I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. £70 was a lot of money back then, and it might have been better spent on something useful for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I found made me happy. I have always enjoyed feeling connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again. 

It was a dull February afternoon, and I had a couple of hours to spare. I had a place in mind, but it was raining, so I decided to go to a closer spot where I knew there was old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then, the detector beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't walk away without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned more dirt away, the ball turned into a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared. Eventually, I remembered to breathe. 

I had seen something like this before - the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It is the most famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring like the one I was looking at. I took it to my car. On the way home, I kept looking at the torc on the passenger seat beside me. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, which was probably the only cleaning it had since ancient times. 

‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I've got something for you.’ While looking at my find, I heard my wife come into the room and stop. ‘What is it?’ she asked after a moment. I explained that it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try the torc on because we were afraid of damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I felt anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath. 

The law says that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before I gave it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, stopped talking, and looked at the torc. It was confirmed as real and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It is something I have saved for the nation. People say to me, ‘Now that you’ve found something so amazing, are you going to stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop - not while there’s a chance of catching a bigger fish tomorrow.'"

What would they think if they knew that my travel plans include time for naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in nice hotel beds? Better sleep is one of the good things about traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours – more than 12 – I spent sleeping most days. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Far from home, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and enjoyably. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I think there is more to it than just relaxing. I believe that sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences fill us up. When we sleep, we process all this information. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are traveling. Sleep also changes from place to place. People often worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to new cultures than just time differences. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, feel tired around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, I still take days to get used to the island’s different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived. I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and one by one, my friends left the table to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows on the floor. I took some pillows for myself and followed their lead. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep has another great quality: I remember it. Being away from home, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep. If enjoying every moment of travel is what makes a modern traveler aware, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is an important part of the experience too."""

Please be honest.” Mia picked up a medium-sized hat that was soft and had a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said to her customer with a polite smile. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a funny face, looking a bit like a bulldog. “But it is so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will make me stand out.” She patted the red and black mini top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” Mia knew she could not change the woman’s mind. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would stand out at her daughter’s wedding. Mia thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and she was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie, who they did not know much about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, her husband Jeff quickly pointed out, “What kind of name is that?” “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “More like something strange,” Jeff said. He did not like anything fancy or showy. He also did not understand Mia’s way of being polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The problem with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite.” 

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered the back door of Medlar House. Her commute from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to turn the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. Mia knew from her friends that many women had trouble finding the perfect hat for special occasions, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became successful. Women came from far away to her shop in the village of Little Pelham, where she created a friendly atmosphere for them to try on as many hats as they needed. She encouraged her customers to bring their outfits so they could find the perfect match. Recently, she also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."

It’s a long way from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye thinks about his amazing journey in sports. He is very confident but is also surprised by how far he has come, from competing in the Olympic final in discus to possibly changing sports. Even though he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still learning about his new position in this unfamiliar sport. 

It is surprising that a 21-year-old beginner from London might be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports. But Lawrence is good at proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to focus on training for discus instead, after playing rugby before. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus, preparing for the world championships. When asked about his sudden chance for a big NFL contract, he says, “American football was in my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school in London, but it seemed like a crazy idea then. After arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played before, he thought he could be good enough to attend the trials. “Pretty much,” he says. “I went on the site and applied.”

Was he nervous about being tested with experienced American football players? “No,” he replies. “I don’t get nervous for many things.” He doesn’t talk a lot, but he is sure of his abilities. The results from his tests showed that he was the most impressive player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he says, showing a bit of pride.

However, he is also cautious. He has no experience in American football. How can he make it onto an NFL team? “The coaches say I have all the skills I need. It’s just about how hard I work,” he answers. Will he be calm while waiting to hear if he has been selected? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will definitely be chosen, but I’m not too worried.”

This calmness might come from his disappointing experience in the Olympic discus final, where he came last. He seems to have moved on from that and is proud that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he says. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.”

After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought that he let the experience affect him. Lawrence does not want to talk about that. An NFL player’s minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so the financial reasons are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talent, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replies. “I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"
99,"Text: 'We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty land below, the dark shades of brown and green made me feel better. Even though it was mid-September, it had not yet started to change in Siberia. I could see no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was going to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. “But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I believed there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend called Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to explain to Sergei with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, but I didn’t mention that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I was not sure they would be good enough. This was especially true of my big postman’s over-trousers that I had bought for £10. 

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students who looked tired. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer was talking on and on. I was thinking hard about a question. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I took a fresh sheet of paper and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I opened it and held my breath while I read. “OK,” it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. Although I was still learning to control my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling, plus there were long holidays to have adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to cycle around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would break him. Even though it sounded hard, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, facing new challenges every day. He was proving wrong the people who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive.'"

In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, do barrel rolls, and fly in loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it is like to be part of this race. 

An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. I was told, “The horizon is your best friend,” and the pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything during the flight. When we were getting ready to take off, I was nervous. I had to keep my legs up and not touch the important steering pedals or switches. I knew I should stay calm and focused to survive the flight. 

As we started to speed down the runway, I felt scared. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out and made another sharp turn, diving down. 

We flew just 10 meters above the ground, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, and I felt a rush of excitement, but then we turned sharply again. I was allowed to fly the plane for two minutes, but my hand was shaking so much that the plane shook too. Dario said something, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, turning the plane completely upside down. 

“Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, while we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields. 

The flight lasted 10 minutes. It felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during the race. When we landed, Dario took out some sandwiches and started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed about doing loops over and over again."

Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever seen amazing videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He says his favorite temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to make a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours, I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater,"" he said. Now, he is a top cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series. 

""I started at a good time. When I began, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became known as the cold man. It felt like all these amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed."" The camera and communication technology were very simple when he started 35 years ago. ""It is much easier to film today. Back then, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much material.""

""My experience in cold conditions is valuable. I know how to handle it. I have spent so much time on sea ice that it feels normal to me. I do get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes."" Allan says that wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify the birds.

Recently, Allan got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He did not expect it to be easy. It is a place with polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, the temperature is usually -32°C, the wind is strong, and carrying cameras in deep snow is very hard. After walking for five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on day 24, he felt like he was in the world of bears, moving and sensing like them. 

""We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. After five hours of watching, I catch a quick glimpse that I almost miss. But the camera is focused on the hole, and I quickly look through the viewfinder. After a few seconds, I see a black nose. The nose becomes a muzzle, then a full head, and in less than a minute, she is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She looks at me but does not care. Just as I think it can't get better, she slides down the slope. I think she is enjoying it,"" he recalls, adding that then two cubs appeared at the den entrance. ""It is clearly their first view of the world. It is showtime on the slopes, and we have front-row seats.""

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and see its effects firsthand. He believes he could create an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. This meant he had to swim in very cold water, deal with frostbite, and avoid polar bears. Just eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new expedition that he says is even more challenging. Explorers are confident and determined people, and they need to be. This time, however, there is a lot more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, where they will measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has ever done this before, and he knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will give a clearer picture of how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar region.

Pen was prepared for this job from a young age. When he was a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She helped him become strong by sending him out into the Scottish mountains during storms with very few clothes. His father also inspired him to love adventures in cold places, and Pen discovered he had great physical strength. 

Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and shares his passion for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he is at home. “He’s in more danger driving on the road because I know he is thinking about the Arctic,” she says. For fun, she once raced against him in a famous mountain event where horse riders compete against runners. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen.

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He says, “It’s much harder to be away from them this time.” When he last went on an expedition, his children were one and five years old. He made a mistake when saying goodbye to his son, telling him to take care of his mother and sister. His son took this very seriously and kept asking his mother how she was, but it became too much for him. Pen feels it was unfair to put that pressure on his son. For this trip, he plans to have very little contact with his family while in the Arctic. “If you call them, it reminds them how far away you are,” he explains.

In the days before he leaves, he is carefully preparing his equipment. “Out on the ice, it is very hard to fix things or do anything complicated,” he says. He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support team of six people who will fly in supplies.

Pen feels that being part of a team can be stressful for him, and he is also thinking about his age. “I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I haven’t trained as much as I would like,” he admits. He explains that organizing things always seems more urgent, and he worries about what he will ask of himself.

Pen believes his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove earlier explorers into unknown places. “Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal for me,” he says, “and it didn’t help many people outside the polar adventure community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data we collect, and we want to involve as many people as possible in what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,” he says. “Our skills, which may seem strange and not useful in everyday life, have become very important. Suddenly, we are useful to society again.”"
103,"Text: ""I took a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a special experience. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Even though I enjoyed these activities, I wanted something competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape so I could try for an Olympic spot if I felt inspired again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But part of me thought it would be nice to be an underdog with no pressure. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had managed to pay the big entry fee and deposit for a boat, which made the race feel real. We talked about the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but we still needed to work hard to get it. Besides the cost of the race, I also had to think about losing money by being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It feels good that people are interested. But I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without having a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just talk about what I did before. I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was tough, and my life was all about getting in the best shape; but looking back, it was quite simple. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training plan was clear, and there were doctors and dieticians to help. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, and I could have chosen a better partner to win the race. But my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing. It is also about mental strength. Ben had completed the hard Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and lived on a deserted island for a year. However, he didn’t know how to row. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest with Ben about the big improvements he needed to make. I should have realized that this was his level when I agreed to race with him."""

Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, maybe because I was tired of the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a pretty but basic place with bad electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I understood the hard work ahead. ""The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical,"" they said. I started packing right away.

**November 6, London**  
On my flight, I stared at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names, but I felt distracted and nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. But I felt like I was seeing winter moving south, with rivers freezing over.

**November 7, Helsinki and Hetta**  
The bus ride north was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer cross the road. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. ""Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?"" Anna asked. I followed the sound of barking, which grew louder as I reached the dogsheds. Three people were running back and forth, pulling the huskies out and getting them ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited, pulling against their ropes. I could barely introduce myself, but the others were too busy to talk. I stood to the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone waved at me impatiently – ""Get in!"" – and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and suddenly we were off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

**November 15, Hetta**  
I quickly learned how to be a husky guide, but first, I had to answer questions about what I could do. ""Are you useful?"" Anna asked. I was confused. I didn’t know. Further questions showed that I was not very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. ""You do have a driving license?"" someone asked finally. I nodded, feeling relieved. 

I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But other things were complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing conditions. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head was full of instructions, and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,"" I emailed my friends. ""In the snow."""
105,"Text: 'On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. It was noted that her time would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special natural treatment, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended to help heal Radcliffe's injuries from an accident when she ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe says that the achievement did not really sink in at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal. However, she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day, so it felt normal to her. She and her support team decided not to set limits on what they could achieve. Their motto was: no limits. During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could keep up her fast pace. He was worried she might drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry about this, but he understood that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left to run, Radcliffe started to think about her time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers quickly, but she still managed to sprint the last distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster than that.’ She remembers the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a long time. Radcliffe thought, “I will come back and do it next year.” Sadly, that did not happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete with such an unusual running style had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, giving her daily training sessions to help her with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ‘I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle the level of pain she could. She would make me work hard because I had to go deep into her muscles, and I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards because I was in so much pain.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ‘Gerard, you’re 15 minutes late, Paula’s waiting.’ There was no ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ As soon as he arrived, she was ready for a two-hour training session. Radcliffe would push him to give everything he had. During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became upset. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I trained very hard, but there are people who are more talented. I thought it would happen with Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner. Maybe it’s because people are racing against each other instead of racing against themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental attitude of never slowing down, even when you are winning, probably helped me because I never thought, “I can relax now.” It was always: “keep pushing as hard as you can.” Radcliffe did not know it then, but that marathon was the best performance of her career. She would never run that fast again. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running.'"
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain, and I believed we had created a series that added something new to it. However, I worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and nervous. I didn’t need to worry. The show became very successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving travel and exploration. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who creates golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent years trying to reach their own ideas of perfection. 

Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew I would upset some people by leaving out their favorites. I could imagine people asking, ‘Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ But after a long meeting, the TV team and I finally created a list that included something for everyone. This experience showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on their emotions, memories, and experiences. Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew I wouldn’t say the recipes were the best. I believed that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, chefs, and customers, I could find out what makes these dishes special. 

The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through practice. It’s about trying ideas and changing them until you create something unique. The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before, and I was excited to connect food with memories because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that was not up to standard, so we had to stop filming there! While perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan pizza.'"

He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets and a serious look on his face. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said finally, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field went on for a long way. There was not much in it, just grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I said, because it was best to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John get smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café. It was away from the road and not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “I think it might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat down in the shade. The tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup in there,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “I guess it’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said when it started to get dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road. She made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home now that our van had to be pulled everywhere. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.'"

Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke good English. They talked about the music they were playing and their travels. 

“I think I'm going to Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go. She often felt busy with concerts and competitions that took her away from school. She was not officially enrolled in school anymore and worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. Lucy hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She had been chosen from thousands of applicants. 

At the party, Lucy’s dad gave her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate her success. Her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied to the festival herself. Her mother had filled out the application and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought her mom just didn’t want to let her say no. Back then, Lucy believed that it was wrong to speak up about what she wanted.

The guy from Tokyo leaned in closer. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to brag. It was hard to know when she was sharing her achievements and when she was showing off. “It’s just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying…” Liesel/Louisa then looked across the room and said she had to go talk to someone. The guy from Tokyo stayed. “Have you ever been to Japan?” he asked. He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool. “Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy replied. 

Just then, Lucy's grandfather came over. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition,” Lucy said. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather replied. He took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what they said. 

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” Lucy liked that. She enjoyed being recognized, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her respect from the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a difficult piece by Rachmaninov. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I decided to learn what experts say about this – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a good sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is now a big part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do – they live in it. This is not good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s ‘like hanging out at the youth club, as parents did when they were younger, to share jokes and catch up on news: a kind of virtual youth club.’ He says it helps teenagers build their identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and connect with friends. 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you find your identity: you can share your favorite music or sports, discover what you like, and see that others have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can help shy people: ‘Talking online can be easier than in person, and it helps you practice social skills in a less stressful way.’ 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with special interests connect with others who like the same things. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people who share your interest, you can feel popular in a different way,’ he says. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘It’s young people who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded individuals, and create their own content who are really using social networks well.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative tool: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity. Keen photographers can connect with each other, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interest. ‘This all helps with getting jobs and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and to grow their brand – and you need to know how it works to attract customers. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they could all be potential customers. If you connect all those networks, you have your customer base.’ 

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is an important skill in the 21st century and is key to being employable in a digital world.’"""

When most people think of a fun family vacation, they might not think of a long trip across nine western states in the US and a part of Canada. However, my parents wanted to have an exciting summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan a trip that he thought would help our family bond. “Not enough people do this anymore,” he and my mom said in the weeks before our vacation, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks.

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our “Family Great American Road Trip.” As we left our big home for smaller places to stay for the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into.

We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had many adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road!

The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. The desert changed to mountains. Each day felt similar, but every adventure was still special. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we noticed a strong smell of sulfur. As we climbed to our next stop, we learned that the roads marked for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers.

Every place we visited showed a mix of old and new. We often had to deal with construction traffic. We laughed when we saw the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms and watched the sun set over bear habitats near the roads. We experienced “bear jams,” where traffic would stop to let bears cross the road, and we had a close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger, which gave us unforgettable memories.

As we drove, life back home felt far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, which had no internet or cell phone service, couldn’t ruin our excitement. The hotel was 95 years old and creaky, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we started our journey back south. My parents were right; you don’t need to go to a faraway place to find something special. 

It was nice to be home together again, and I was happy that I didn’t fight with my brother during our long trip. We had three thousand photos from our adventure to look through. I knew that the best memories would be the unexpected and spontaneous moments."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would spend the next year finishing her last school courses and living under the care of the college Head. It was her final year at school, so it would not be fair for her to move. Amy was happy because she got the best room at the college, which had its own kitchen and study area. She also had free access to the Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house.

Rose only had vague memories of her grandmother from holidays, and she had never known her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to get to know Rose again. Rose was not sure why her parents did not get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Because of this, Rose had spent summers away from her only other family member. The last time Rose said goodbye to Daisy, she was only ten years old, but she remembered happy times. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose expected to get dinner invitations, coffee morning requests, and shopping trips soon. The thought made her smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she seemed to go to more social events than anyone else.

Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time, Rose wanted one thing: her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission every time. She wanted to be trusted to do these small things. She didn’t want to be reminded about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be taken around by her grandmother. Daisy understood.

Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, as Dahlia insisted. Rose was very happy. They all agreed that it would be about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If either of them went too far, they would talk about it again.

Rose was not a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her a lot. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this was the last time because she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new moment in her life, a new piece in the puzzle that was her life."
112,"Text: Charlotte Grainger says that her primary school teacher first thought she might write a novel. “I believed that writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed like a challenge. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’ The novel Charlotte started at that age is about to be published. “I recently told my old teacher about it, and she was surprised. She thought I would probably write a book when I was 30 or 40. I never thought that – I didn’t understand why I should wait to do something I might be good at.” 

It is a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a great achievement: the story is strong and full of action. Nothing about it, except for the age of its main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. The public relations representative for the book is with us in case Charlotte needs help. But she doesn’t need any support. She is confident, with a bright face and a sharp mind, but also calm, which keeps her from being too confident. 

Charlotte understands that she is still young. I ask her about the complex moral questions in her book. “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers,” she laughs. “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I’m very wise. I was just interested in the theme of taking responsibility.” 

She has a theory about teenagers and how they are often misrepresented in books aimed at them. She believes there are three types of teenagers shown in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. Reading about these types annoyed her. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who aren’t lacking in some way. Some writers give the impression that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience. This can hurt their self-confidence.” 

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but their books almost stopped her from writing. “Books by my favorite fantasy authors explore deep topics about psychology and life. I asked myself: is this what I need to do to write a good book? Am I really capable of that?” However, she praises a book called How Not to Write a Novel. “It says that if the reader starts to guess what will happen, the suspense is probably gone.” 

Some might say that Charlotte’s parents, who are both journalists, helped her get her novel published. In fact, her father’s connection in publishing was what got her book read at first. She knows she is lucky because it is hard to get anyone to read a first novel, no matter the author’s age. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. In the end, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went up the ramp quickly and flew into the air, arms waving. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said kindly, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ Maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On past skiing holidays, I had enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I was not like those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid I would look silly if I tried to join them. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a training center for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students jumped and tried their new tricks, landing in foam pits – not a real introduction to skiing. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their moves for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope goes down to the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which is better. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important. At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs would almost go backward as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied moves we would make while ski-jumping, and others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing while spinning in the air. Gareth gave us tips. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, and then I found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes before I finally landed correctly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving my goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I made myself keep my speed up as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed in the right spot. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Text: 'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold tightly to the safety harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly goes up. There is a pause, then a quick drop that makes your stomach feel funny. You move fast forward, turn sharply to the left, and then go upside down. You feel scared and let out a loud scream. But you chose to be here, just like many others who pay to enter a theme park.

It is interesting to think about how amusement parks, with their exciting rides, are a big business. To create the thrills that visitors want, there are many teams of engineers and designers working behind the scenes. The job of a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a dream for a child, but it is actually very challenging. They must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping everyone safe. They also need to come up with new ideas to keep visitors excited.

Many people think that rollercoasters are getting more extreme, but most of the designs we see today were created by a US designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. Back then, there were fewer safety rules, and some rides were very intense, which made some passengers uncomfortable. Now, designers have to follow the guidelines set by ride manufacturers.

I talked to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said that the skill is in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts, an engineer, explained that it is important to quickly switch between feelings of excitement and safety so that riders feel thrilled but not scared. 

To create an amazing ride, the teams must come up with a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, that fits with the ride's features, such as height and speed. Professor Walker mentioned that, like in many creative jobs, experience and testing are very important. Jeff Hornick, a senior director in theme park development, added that it helps to love thrills when designing rollercoasters to understand what riders want and to test the rides before they open.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers will use new technology, like virtual reality. Walker said we should not expect too much from it. He explained that while virtual reality can make rides look exciting, the real experience of being on a rollercoaster is what matters most, and that will continue to be important for a long time.'"
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things in her busy life. She says, “Dancing again reminds me of what it is like to be in the studio, following the orders of strict choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers can forget what it is like to rehearse all day.”

As a choreographer, she teaches and enjoys working with young students. She explains, “A new dancer is often open to trying new ideas. Sometimes, it is easier to work with students than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they do not yet know their strengths and weaknesses. This means they can accept even tough criticism. However, they might still question what I say, and I welcome their honest feedback.”

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. She says, “There may be music I don’t like, but I still try to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers do not respond well to a certain piece of music, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I cannot just choose a new piece of music. I wish I could be more experimental and change the music sometimes; it would help improve the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I usually work on big productions where the music is already decided by the composer.”

Miranda does not want to stick to one place. She says, “It is important to meet new people. But I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I must be ready to change how I work each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing everywhere. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.”

The conversation shifts to a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were not true. This one tries to show what life is really like in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer is getting many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized it. She knows she is not doing it right but cannot make her body do what is needed. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not understand how much work and dedication ballet requires.”

I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She replies, “It is when everything the company has worked on – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help you get away with some mistakes. I have been in productions where the dance steps are good, but something about the costumes or props is distracting. That is disappointing.”

Miranda has done many different types of work, so I ask how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? She says, “People want to label you, and I do not understand that. There is a trend to focus on being an expert in one area. I do not follow that, but maybe one day I will be happy to be known for one thing. For now, I just want to explore more.”"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my fun four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. A friend was giving away his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to carry it. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I have walked on foot many times, but this was something very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I could stop at cafés along the way to relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website.'"
117,"Text: 'When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and showed me on board. 

Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would follow us, and they made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first proper swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own. 

The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the view. As the swims got longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. I felt like I did not need the support boat much anymore. I can hardly wait to come back next year.'"

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I always flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to the passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed in my mind when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new path.

At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people, and many of us were hired. We were all well-qualified and looking to change careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and my past work experience, not just that I loved to travel, which everyone else said. Because of this, I got the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone because there are many good things about it, but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: ‘no one is finished until everyone is finished.’ It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. When I am not working, I don’t have to take my work home. If I do have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!'"
119,"Text: ""At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children do things they never thought they could do. Most of the children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home. It is not the youngest ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and at the end of their week, they all come to us and thank us because they had a great time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call all the time to ask how their child is doing, which is not necessary. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back later. We often see a certain type of child who comes to camp, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."""
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where the actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, doing the show with an all-British cast was not easy. The UK has more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors from the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night, with many people wanting to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

What do his friends think of the show? ‘My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I told Jamie that I also play guitar, he found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 

The young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, but none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
