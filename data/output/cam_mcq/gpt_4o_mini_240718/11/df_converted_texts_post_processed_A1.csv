A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins. Public check-ins are when you tell people online where you are. The website said that when you say, ""I am at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are. Some of these people may not be good to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have problems. 
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can get lost in this sharing. It can be scary. However, we should not give up. There are lessons from people who used the internet a long time ago. 
In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. At that time, the internet was mostly for students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his life, so he created a blog. He wrote about everything and shared many photos. People liked to read his blog because he was brave and shared many things. 
One day, people went to his blog and saw a sad video instead of his usual posts. Hall had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to stop or lose his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. 
In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can have real-life consequences. 
Armstrong was sad and stopped blogging for a while, but later she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular and makes money from her writing. She learned that while we can say anything online, we should think carefully before we do. 
**Questions:**
1. What is a public check-in?
2. Who is Justin Hall?
3. What happened to Justin Hall when he wrote about his love?
4. What is the name of Heather Armstrong's blog?

Some scientists wanted to warn people about a low-budget movie called *What the Bleep Do We Know?* This movie mixes real information and stories to show that we do not understand a lot about our universe. Some scientists thought the movie was very bad and even dangerous. 
At first, I did not understand why the movie was so important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries that show the universe is very strange. Then, the movie talked about how water can be changed by thoughts. I heard that a Japanese researcher showed that water can change shape based on how people feel. The movie showed nice pictures of ice crystals that looked good when people were happy and looked bad when people were angry. 
Many people think this is interesting, but scientists want more proof. They want real evidence, not just pretty pictures. The movie's claims were not strange enough. Scientists say that water has energy that comes from nowhere and is connected to a force that makes the universe grow. This idea is based on many years of research, not just a few pictures.
Scientists have found that the universe is made of a type of matter we do not know about, and it is pushed by something called ""dark energy."" Other discoveries are also surprising. Scientists found that our brains take about half a second to understand what happens around us. They also think they know where modern humans first lived and how they spread around the world. Some scientists believe there is a link between life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Science is always changing and growing. We are learning that many things in nature are more complicated than we thought. Some scientists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. But many of us think the universe is best described with one word: incredible.
**Questions:**
1. What is the name of the movie that some scientists warned people about?
2. What do scientists think about the idea that water can be changed by thoughts?
3. What do scientists want instead of pretty pictures?
4. What is ""dark energy""?
5. What do some scientists believe about the first modern humans?"
3,C2,"""Writing novels is hard for me, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a big forest. Writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. The trees in the forest give shade, and the leaves move in the wind. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colors attract bees and butterflies. 
Since I started writing, I have often switched between novels and short stories. When I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. When I finish short stories, I want to write a novel. I do not write short stories when I am writing a novel, and I do not write a novel when I am writing short stories. 
I began my writing career with two short novels in 1975. From 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I did not know much about writing short stories then, but it was a great experience. One of my first short stories, 'Breaking Waves', was in my first collection called Tales from Abroad. 
One good thing about short stories is that they do not take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to write a short story. Writing a novel takes a year or two, and it can feel very long. Writing short stories is a nice change for me. 
Another good thing is that you can create a story from small ideas, like a word or an image. Writing a short story is like playing jazz music; the story goes where it wants. If a short story does not work out, it is okay. Not every story has to be perfect. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver have stories that are not great. 
I learn from my mistakes in short stories and use that to help me write novels. Short stories help me try new things. They are like small memories I have shared with the world. I remember how I felt when I wrote each one. Short stories show my feelings, and I am happy to share them with my readers."""

Science is a way to understand the world. It helps us in many ways, like curing diseases, but it can also create problems. Science tries to explain everything, from tiny atoms to the universe. It has influenced many people, including poets and leaders. Sometimes, people do not understand science well, and they may think it is more important or less important than it really is. 
Science changes all the time. New ideas can replace old ones. For example, in the past, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Now, scientists have new ideas that change how we see the universe. Some people think that science cannot explain everything, but new discoveries help us understand more about nature.
Famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein have helped us learn a lot. Science has made many discoveries, like radioactivity and the electron. Today, some people believe we will find a complete explanation of the universe soon.
Science is important for everyone. It affects our lives and the future of our planet. We need to understand science because it helps us make decisions that can change our world and our children's lives."

Since about 2015, big book publishers have said that sales of ebooks are not growing as much as before. Some publishers even think that they invested too much in ebooks and lost faith in printed books. People still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question makes us think and talk a lot. Why do we think ebooks and printed books are in a fight? The answers show how we feel about new things and changes in our lives.
In my research, I found that when new technology comes, people often say it will end older technology. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. The idea that books might disappear is not new. In 1894, some people thought that phonographs would replace books with audiobooks.
Many times, people have said that new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end printed books. Some people worried that this would be bad for culture. Others thought ebooks would be much better. The idea that books might die comes up when new technology appears. This shows our hopes and fears about change.
We feel strong connections to things like books and computers. We even name our cars or get upset when our laptops don’t work. When new technology, like e-readers, comes, it changes our relationship with things we love. We often miss what we used to have. This is why some people still want old products. For example, when the printing press was made in the 15th century, people wanted original manuscripts. When movies changed from silent to sound, people missed silent films. The same happened with photography and music.
E-readers have made people appreciate printed books more, even their smell. This should make people feel better about printed books not disappearing. But the idea that something might disappear will always be interesting. It shows both our excitement for new things and our fear of losing what we love. We often tell stories about change that are easy to remember, like stories of loss. The story of the death of the book reflects our hopes for the future and our fear of losing parts of our lives.

Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I wrote about how great thinkers from the last four hundred years did their best work. I wanted to show how they organized their time to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried. I hoped to show their personalities and careers in a fun way. 
A French writer, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I say, “Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap.” This book is about how people create, not just what they create. It is also personal. The writer John Cheever said that you show something about yourself when you write. 
I have questions in this book that I think about in my own life: How do you do creative work and also earn money? Is it better to work on one project or a little bit each day? When there is not enough time, do you give things up, like sleep or a clean house? Or can you learn to do more in less time? 
I do not have all the answers, but I want to show how many successful people faced the same problems. I wanted to show how big ideas become small daily actions and how working habits affect the work. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it is really about people’s routines. A routine can seem boring, but it can help you use your time well. 
The psychologist William James said that good habits can help us focus on important things. Ironically, he was a procrastinator and could not keep a regular schedule. 
One Sunday, I was at my job, trying to write a story. Instead of working, I was cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a morning person and can focus well in the morning, but I am not good after lunch. That afternoon, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I thought it would be good to collect these stories, so I started a blog called Daily Routines. 
In the blog, I shared people’s routines from biographies and articles. For this book, I gathered more information and tried to keep it interesting. I let my subjects speak for themselves with quotes from their letters and diaries. I also summarized their routines from other sources. 
This book would not be possible without the work of many biographers and journalists. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for more reading."

Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist when he was six years old. His father was worried about money and said they could not go on holiday to Spain. Instead, they went to a beach in England. On a rainy day, Howard found an ammonite shell on the beach. He always wanted to study old creatures. At university, he decided what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He liked studying the very beginning of life, not dinosaurs.
After finishing his studies, Howard was worried about getting a job. He felt good about his skills, but he knew that sometimes good people do not get jobs. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied, but he did not expect much.
On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help him had a fight with his wife. He was upset and had an accident, so he could not come to the interview. Another professor, who did not like the first one, took his place. This professor helped Howard get the job. Howard was surprised but happy to have the job.
Howard liked his work because he could plan and do his research. But sometimes, things in his personal life were chaotic. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes at a train station. He was very angry and went back to the college. He called to postpone his lecture and reported the theft. After that, he had coffee with a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. 
Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that he could study. This would be a big challenge for him and help his career. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find money to visit the museum in Nairobi.

Charles Spence eats many different foods. He says, ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home."" The larvae look like maggots, but they taste a little nutty and floral. Spence is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to help us taste food. He wants to make eating bugs more acceptable. 
Spence's work affects what we eat and drink. He helps big food companies and restaurants with their menus. He studies how we experience food. For example, who we eat with, how food looks, and even background noise can change how food tastes. 
In his book, *The Perfect Meal*, Spence shares interesting facts about food. Did you know that the first person to order food in a restaurant usually enjoys it more? And when we eat with one other person, we eat about 35% more food. If we eat with three people, we eat 75% more!
Spence's lab is simple. He has soundproof booths and old audio equipment. This helps him work with cooks who do not have much money for research. Many of his projects are funded by a big food company. 
Spence helps food companies reduce salt and sugar in their products. This is important because it helps customers stay healthy. Many companies make these changes slowly so that people do not notice. Spence says that if people know about the changes, they may not like the food as much.
Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a food project. They worked together to create a dish called ""Sound of the Sea."" Spence studies how sounds can change the taste of food. For example, high music can make food taste sweeter, while low music can make it taste bitter. 
Soon, an airline will match music with the food they serve. Last year, a brand made an app that played music while your ice cream melts, but they did not match the music to the taste.
What are dinner parties like at Spence's home? One time, they ate rabbit with the fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled lights. They even had a dinner party with headphones and different drinks to see how they tasted with different sounds. For Spence, home and food events are all part of his research.

Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, like facts, rumors, and opinions. We have to find what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things than before. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do many things by ourselves. We are trying to do the work of many people while also taking care of our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us with all this. 
But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are really just switching quickly from one task to another. This can make us less efficient. Multitasking can also increase stress in our brains, making it hard to think clearly. 
The part of our brain that helps us focus can easily get distracted by new things. This makes it hard to stay on task. Just trying to multitask can hurt our ability to think well. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus while seeing unread emails can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. 
Russ Poldrack, another scientist, found that learning while multitasking can send information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, they do not remember the information as well. Without distractions, they can remember better. 
Multitasking also means we have to make many small decisions, like whether to answer a text message. Making decisions can be hard for our brains. After making many small decisions, we can make bad choices about important things. 
Many people talk about email as a problem. It is not that email is bad, but the large amount of emails we get is overwhelming. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does, he said, ""He answers emails."" His father agreed that this is true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and get other things done. 
**Questions:**
1. What do we get a lot of today that makes our brains busy?

3. What do smartphones help us with?

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night. He did this to throw pieces at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they cannot give birth properly. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. Animals acted in certain ways, and scientists studied these actions. They did not believe that animals had feelings or thoughts. But now, this idea is changing. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals have emotions. This has led to books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". 
This change has started a big question: do animals have thoughts like humans? This question leads to another one: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? In a recent study with cows, those that opened a locked gate for food seemed happier than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? People agree on what they see, but they do not agree on what it means. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks this is a big change in how we think about ethics. Aubrey Manning, a professor, believes we should think again about how animals think. He says animals might have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings on animals. 
These ideas may never agree because the main issue is not just science or morals, but philosophy. It is hard to define what consciousness is. Can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe did an important study that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were put into two groups. One group had nice cages with space and water. The other group had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and not to eat bad worms from another box. But when only bad worms were given, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe thinks that being in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life. 
Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, has strong opinions. He says, “We look back and feel bad about racism. One day, we will feel the same about how we treat animals.” If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning wrote a book called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He says, “We are changing how we think about animals. In the past, some people thought animals thought like us, but now we are seeing things differently. This is a complicated topic, and we should listen carefully to different opinions.”"

Critical thinking is a way to understand better what we read or hear. Adrian West, a researcher, says that arguing can help us find the truth. Technology helps us store information, but it can also make it hard to think deeply about problems. West mentions that we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More information does not always mean we make better decisions. 
Reading books has gone down a lot, and this may hurt our critical thinking skills. Patricia Greenfield, a professor, believes that focusing more on videos and fast media makes it harder to think about one thing deeply. We do not yet know exactly how technology affects our thinking. 
Technology can be both good and bad. For example, a computer game can help us think better or make it harder to think. Reading online can help us analyze information, but clicking on many links can distract us. Greenfield studied how technology changes our thinking. She says reading helps us think and use our imagination more than video games or TV. However, some visual media can help us process information quickly. 
Many young people do not reach their full potential because they do not spend enough time thinking deeply. How we see technology affects how we think critically. James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games are not always bad for kids. They can be fun and also help us learn. Some games teach us to make decisions and think critically in a way that feels real. 
In today’s world, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects our thinking."

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He writes about how we should live. His first book talks about the good things about working with our hands. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. 
One day, while shopping, he saw ads on a credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. He realized that these ads make it hard for us to focus. We often cannot think about what we want because of distractions. It is harder to remember conversations. People do not want to talk to strangers anymore because they are always interrupted. 
Crawford says we see the world through things like video games and apps. These things show us what we want but can take over our lives. Many office workers complain about emails but still check them in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to pay attention. 
Crawford believes that technology makes us more self-focused. We have many choices, which makes it hard to control ourselves. We often prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. He thinks that by only using screens, we lose real connections with people. 
He gives an example of a gym. In the past, there was one music player for everyone. Now, people listen to their own music with ear buds. The gym used to be a place to meet others, but now it is not. 
Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we need to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, he believes we should practice skills that help us connect with the real world. For example, cooks, hockey players, and motorcycle racers deal with real things. They use their judgment and work with others. 
Crawford says that when we engage with the real world, we see that fake experiences are not as good. It is important to find ways to use our judgment. This can help us focus better and enjoy life more."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question. People often talk about their jobs. But if you are a philosopher, it can be a little different. Saying ""I am a philosopher"" can sound strange. It can seem like you think you know more than others. But this is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else.
Philosophers often think about life and how we live. A famous philosopher named Aristotle said that thinking about life is very important. He believed that a thoughtful life is the best kind of life. Another philosopher, Socrates, said that a life without thinking is not worth living. This means that we should think about our lives and the choices we make.
Thinking about our lives does not mean we need to read many difficult books. It just means we should look closely at our daily experiences. We do not need to be alone to think about life. In fact, thinking about life can help us make better choices. 
However, many people think philosophers are far away from real life. This is partly because philosophy has become a job that is hard to understand. Philosophers often write for other philosophers, not for everyone. This makes it hard for people to see how philosophy relates to their lives.
I often call myself an ""ethicist"" because I study ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. Ethics is important because it helps us think about our actions. For example, we might ask if downloading movies illegally is wrong. This is an important question. But philosophy is more than just ethics. It helps us think about many things in our lives.
By thinking about our actions and beliefs, we can learn more about ourselves. Sometimes we find out we already know something. Other times, we may realize our beliefs are not easy to explain. Either way, thinking about these ideas can help everyone."

People who love food, like foodies and chefs, think that thinking about what we eat can make eating more enjoyable. In the past, when philosophers talked about food, they often used it to explain other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, it seems like they are talking about food, but they are really discussing other topics. 
One famous philosopher, Epicurus, believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many parts of life. His name is now often connected to enjoying food and drink. Many restaurants and food shops use his name because they think it will attract customers. Food is not just about eating; it is also about sharing with others. The food we eat comes from history and is part of our communities. These communities help us grow and share food. 
When food is ready, critics talk and write about it. Some people wonder why food critics are important. One philosopher said that tasting food is not a special skill; good critics just describe food better. Most studies about how we sense things focus on sight, not taste, and this should change. 
Another important part of food is beauty. We say paintings and music are beautiful, but we don’t often say this about food. Some philosophers think that, because of modern cooking, food should be considered beautiful like art. However, food is eaten and gone, while art stays. 
There are also many questions about what we should eat. Should we eat organic food, free-range meat, or vegetarian meals? Our choices show our beliefs about what is right or wrong. Philosophers like to ask why we make these choices, and this is important to discuss. 
Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their friends and family. When we cook at home, everyone shares food and time together. But restaurant cooks work for their boss and have different responsibilities. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and they work with colleagues, not friends. 
A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" talks about how food can help people from different cultures connect. We can learn to enjoy other people's food and build friendships by eating together. This idea has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting stories that make food philosophy exciting for everyone."

Rob Daviau is from the US. He makes special board games called ‘legacy’ games. When he was a child, he played board games, but he thought they were not fun or challenging anymore. He wanted to make board games better. He asked, “Can board games have a story? Can choices in one game affect the next game?” 
He changed a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made by players change the game forever. Players might have to tear up cards, change the board, or open new packets with new rules. The game is played over several sessions, and players remember their past actions. Daviau said, “You can point to the board and say: ‘You did this!’”
Then, he worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players try to cure diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. Pandemic Legacy was very popular, but SeaFall was a big test because it was a new game. In SeaFall, players are sailors exploring a new world.
Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make. They need testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it can break. Then you have to fix everything.”
At first, Daviau did not think legacy games would be very popular. He thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He said it was a big step in game design. “It’s exciting to learn new games,” he said.
Another fan, Ben Hogg, said people liked the adventure in legacy games. He said, “At first, I was worried about changing the game, but Pandemic Legacy showed me it was okay. People want new experiences, like in movies or video games.”
Legacy games are inspired by video games and popular TV shows. Daviau wanted to be a TV writer but later became a game designer. He still loves telling stories. Matt Leacock, who created Pandemic, said making legacy games is like writing a book. “You need to know how it starts and how it ends,” he said.
Daviau is happy with his work but wants to see what others do with the idea. He thinks players will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the company that published SeaFall, believes legacy games are very important. “It changes how we think about board games,” he said.

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and many people shared it online. 
People like to think that animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Some scientists believe that animals have many smart behaviors, like remembering the past and understanding others' feelings. 
In the past, people thought animals were smart. For example, in medieval Europe, animals could be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, said that humans and animals are different, but not in a big way. 
In the 20th century, many people thought animals were not very smart. They believed animals only acted based on rewards and punishments. This idea changed how people saw animals. During this time, humans also harmed animal homes and did not care about animal welfare. 
Now, Dr. Frans de Waal believes we are starting to understand that animals are smarter than we thought. He says that animals have their own special skills. For example, squirrels can remember where they hide their nuts, which is something we might forget. 
In her book, Sy Montgomery talks about octopuses. She says that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we are not smart because we cannot change our skin color like they can. 
Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found the drain to the ocean. He knows that stories about animals can help people see how smart they are. He did an experiment with monkeys to see if they feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got very upset. A video of this experiment helped many people understand the findings. 
This shows how interesting and complex animal minds can be.

Robots are becoming very important in our world. They are not just in stories anymore; they are in factories and other places. Many experts say that robots will change how we work in many jobs. Some people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do in the next 50 years. However, many also believe their jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Robots will affect all types of jobs soon.
For example, a company in Australia called Fastbrick Robotics has made a robot named Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. It would take two human workers a whole day to do the same job. Another robot, called Tally, helps in supermarkets. It checks if the shelves have enough products and if they are in the right place.
Some people say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means there will be new jobs for people who can work with robots. But others worry that we need to keep our human skills at work. They think that losing the human touch will be a big problem.
Dr. Jing Bing Zhang is an expert on robots. He studies how robots will change jobs in the future. He says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and work better with humans. In three years, many big companies will have a special person to manage robots. In five years, salaries in the robot industry will go up a lot, but there will still be many jobs that need skilled workers.
Zhang believes that people who have lower skills will be affected by robots. He says they should learn new skills instead of waiting for the government to help them. People cannot do the same job for their whole life anymore.
New technology will create new types of robots that we have not seen before. These robots will live with us in our homes and interact with us. This is a big chance for companies, but it also brings challenges. We need new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy.
With many jobs at risk, it is important to focus on education. Countries need more students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay strong in the future. 
**Questions:**
1. What is the name of the robot that can lay bricks quickly?
2. What does the robot Tally do in supermarkets?
3. Who is Dr. Jing Bing Zhang?
4. What should lower-skilled workers do according to Zhang?
5. Why do countries need more STEM graduates?"
18,C1,"George Mallory was a mountaineer. He was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He said, ""Because it’s there."" This answer shows that climbing can be about adventure and fun. 
A writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay in 1967 called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He talked about seven different climbing activities, from playing on rocks to climbing big mountains. Each activity has its own rules. 
Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. But sometimes, climbing can also feel very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not very freeing. This shows that climbing can be both freeing and restricting.
Joe Fitschen, a US rock climber, wrote an essay where he asked, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is part of being human. We like to take on challenges, even if they are risky. 
Another writer, Brian Treanor, said that climbing can help us learn important values like courage and respect for nature. He thinks these values are important in our modern world.
Some expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson, believe that climbing alone is harder and deserves more recognition than climbing with a team or using extra help, like oxygen tanks. However, this idea can be dangerous for some climbers.
Climbing can also be about being in the moment and solving problems. Some people say that climbing is similar to Zen philosophy, which helps train the mind to find peace. This is another reason why people may be drawn to climbing."

Alfred Brendel is a famous pianist. He played classical music for over sixty years. He was very smart and serious. He played many important piano pieces and recorded them. He wrote a lot but did not teach many students. People who knew him saw that he could be fun, but he was usually serious in concerts. He studied, traveled, and performed a lot.
A few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts. He asked Brendel for piano lessons. At first, Brendel did not think this was a good idea. He had very few students and did not want to start teaching. He remembered a famous pianist who said, “You don’t ask a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” But when he listened to Kit play, he changed his mind. Kit was about 14 years old and played very well without looking at the music. He even gave Brendel a CD of his performance, which was beautiful. Brendel thought, “I must make time for him.”
Now, Kit is 19 years old. He is always busy learning new things like languages, math, computer code, and playing tennis. His mother is always with him. Kit also composes music. Brendel thinks this is important. He says that writing music helps you learn to read it better. He noticed that Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. Kit listens to his own playing and understands what Brendel teaches him.
Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He does not like when newspapers call Kit the best pianist of the 21st century. He thinks this can be harmful. Young musicians can play some things very well, but they need time to improve in other areas. 
Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says that when he was young, he did not want to be famous quickly. He wanted to achieve certain things by the time he was 50. When he turned 50, he felt he had done most of those things but still wanted to do more. Even though he cannot play as much now, he still thinks about music and enjoys his new life."

When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river. It sloped down to the water. You could not go to the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a peaceful place. 
Grandad’s garden was simple. He did not have a big greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames. They used plastic to cover broken glass. 
At home, my father was quiet. He was not serious all the time. He liked to say funny phrases. One of his favorites was, “It’s immaterial to me.” He could have just said, “I don’t mind,” but he liked the word “immaterial.” My father left school without any qualifications and became a plumber. He did not love plumbing. He was not very ambitious. He and my mother thought about moving to Canada, but it did not happen. 
My father was good at fixing things at home. He could build bookshelves and cupboards very well. My parents moved to a new house only once. But my mother liked to change the furniture a lot. Just when you got used to one chair, she would bring in another. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I was not allowed to play the piano. My sister had lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I could not play, she said, “You’d never have practiced.”
I liked the river best when I could choose between the moors, woods, or river. I could imagine another world by the river. I would take a fishing net and wear old sandals. I would walk along the riverbank looking for a good place to take off my sandals. I wanted to catch fish with my net. But after trying to keep them alive in the yard, I had to put them back in the water.
I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed hard. One day, my father said, “There is a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.” In that moment, my father surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter. But I like to think he saw my love for gardening. Even if he did not like gardening himself, he noticed my passion for plants and flowers."

Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. The strong wind is very strong, and it feels like it could blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. But Lawrence’s dog, Tie, comes close, and Lawrence pets him gently. The wind cannot make Lawrence uncomfortable. He is happy on his island.
Lawrence shows me around. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It gets a lot of rain.” I see dark clouds over Rum. “Beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 
Suddenly, Lawrence says, “I have sheep to move.” We walk down the hill. He tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide. The geese eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. 
While moving the sheep, Tie, the dog, is not doing a good job. Lawrence says, “Away to me, Tie,” but Tie does not listen. Lawrence sounds disappointed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can play outside and sail boats in the summer. “They go out and come back when they are hungry,” Mary says.
But life on the island is not easy. There is electricity only sometimes. One evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary making breakfast with a flashlight. I also have no mobile phone service. Mary tells me, “You can use your phone on the hill, but most people just put it away after a few days.” So I do too.
Everything on Muck is surprising. A boat comes with groceries and three musicians. They play music in the island’s tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, by the warm fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father bought a small farm on Soay without seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny went to manage it.” Did Jenny know about farms? “She could type well.”
I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. I eat well because most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary. By 7 pm, we eat the fish, and it is very good.
The next morning, I worry about my ferry to the next island. Many ferries were canceled because of high waves. If my ferry does not come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. I secretly hope for that.

The game design industry used to be for computer scientists and self-taught people. Many thought video games were just a hobby for young people. Now, the video game industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into this industry. Making video games that come out after movies needs many team members and a lot of skill and hard work. 
Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says, “It is hard to get a job in big companies. But the industry needs game designers now more than ever. They need not just the big directors but also the people who design parts of the game.” 
So, how can you start a career in this competitive field? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks differently. He says, “The best way is to make games. You need to show what you can do. Game design is not just a job; it is a way of life.” 
Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds, “It is not that simple. Many people want to work in games, but few have the skills needed today. You need to be creative and have technical knowledge.” 
Can you work alone? John says, “Maybe, but it is hard. A good course in games can help you. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and then move up. They love all kinds of entertainment and culture. They may have worked for a few years after school but know that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games.” 
Connections can also help you get ahead in the game industry. Many people forget this, but knowing others in the field is important. 
The idea of a young boy playing video games all the time is changing. Now, many adults play games too. Families often play together on consoles. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. “Games are popular with many people. They are also a fun way to learn, and I see many new opportunities in this area.”"
23,B2,"""Since I was a child, I wanted to kick a football. My dad encouraged me to play. I am happy he did not force me. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play football. I am glad I still love it. When I score a great goal, some people say it is luck, but it is not. I have practiced shooting from far away since I was a kid. You need to practice to score amazing goals. The best players practice a lot. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned good skills. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning. I played many sports in school, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know school is important, but I only thought about football then. The teachers did a good job, but I did not see it. I do not want my son to be like that. We read him books, even if he is too young to sit still. I hope he does not just want to kick the books around. 
At the start of my football career, the manager helped young players like me to play for the first team. He did not make a big deal about it, but we knew it was important. I scored in the first game, but we lost. A TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us work harder. We had doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I depend on my close friends and family. Having money can cause problems. Some people say, ‘I can’t believe you let your mother work.’ I help my parents with money. I paid off their house and bought them a car for Christmas. My family is strong, and they do not want to be treated like they need help. My mum loves her job as a hairdresser, even if she does not earn much. I like to use my money to help my family. I have money, but it does not solve everything. After I stop playing, I want to take a break and do things I could not do before. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I break my leg, I cannot play football again."""

Sam Carter helped us live at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. My father could not write anything in Los Angeles, so Sam wanted to find us a cheap place to live. 
In the summer, the beach was empty because of the sea fogs. Reef Point did not have many visitors. The road was not nice, and a better place, La Carmella, was nearby. People with money went there. Only those who had no money or loved surfing came to Reef Point. 
But now, with the hot weather, many people came to the beach. After being alone for months, we were now surrounded by people. My father was busy trying to write a script. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. 
When we first moved to Reef Point, we did not have a dog. Rusty came to us and did not leave. I tried to send him away, but he always came back. One day, I gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he did not really want to hurt him. Rusty came closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to?” My father said, “He thinks we belong to him.” 
Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes he found things that were not his, like a sneaker or a beach towel. I had to give these back to their owners. Rusty liked to swim with me, even though I could swim faster. 
That day, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I played in the sea all afternoon. As the sun set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day. One surfer was very good. She rode a wave and then came to the shore. 
“Hi,” she said. “Why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I have no money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script of a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“Do you mean, Tall as the Morning?” 
I nodded. 
“I read that book!” She looked at me with interest. I thought it was nice when people were friendly and interested in my father’s book."

Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on the Queen Caroline ship. Her friend Annie had told her, “It is better to arrive late.” But now, Violet was not happy. There was a problem with the computer system, and no one was moving. The people in line were getting upset. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted to enjoy it.
Violet felt worried. She looked in her bag for her phone, but it was not there. This made her more upset. She could not call the taxi company to see if she left her phone in the taxi because all the phone numbers were in her phone. 
Behind her, a nice couple stood in line. Violet asked them, “Can I use your phone to make a call? I think I left my phone behind.” She called her son Harry and left a message. She asked him to tell her neighbor, Kristina, to check if her phone was at home. If it was not there, she would have a problem because she needed her phone in New York.
Finally, the line moved, and Violet gave her travel documents to the worker. When she got inside the ship, it looked like a fancy hotel, but not a very nice one. There were shiny decorations and big lights. She followed the signs to the elevators, which were full of tired passengers. 
When the elevator stopped at the twelfth floor, Violet got out. She was happy to see that her room had a balcony, just like she wanted. She had paid a lot of money for this room because she wanted to enjoy her trip at sea."

John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Vivian Maier, a street photographer. Maloof has collected many things from Maier’s life, including her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives. He also has 8mm movies and audiotapes.
One morning, Maloof looked at everything he had. He felt lucky. He said, “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was.” Maloof is a flea market seller and could have sold everything to someone else.
Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families that hired her as a nanny and to people who developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always had a camera. She wore big coats, wide hats, and sturdy shoes. 
Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier, said, “On her day off, the camera was around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her until late at night.” Maier had strong opinions about movies and politics. She knew a lot about theater and movies. Even though she was not very social, she walked the streets with her camera and talked to people. 
Rydzon said, “She was a true artist and followed her dreams.” Maier’s work is real art; she did not do it for money. Her photos show women, children, the old, the poor, and abstract scenes. Photography expert Larry Silverman said, “Vivian has many interesting pictures.” He wonders if she created her own style or learned from other photographers.
Maloof often thinks about the negatives he has stored in three fireproof cabinets. He did not care about photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, he started taking pictures himself. He said, “I realized that the people and street scenes were more important than I thought. I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to share Vivian Maier’s name and get her into the history books.”"

When a book is called ambitious, it often means it did not succeed completely. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. 
Eleanor told me a story about being stopped at passport control. The officer asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed her book through the glass. The officer looked at it and asked, “What is it about?” This is not an easy question for a writer. 
The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand in the 1860s. There are many crimes, and twelve men come together to solve them. The story is very complex. Eleanor wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical book, but she found that the past gave her many ideas for her characters. The book is more than 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good story.
When I asked her how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it feels nice. She feels that people from her small country share in her success. She also said it is annoying when people think her book is not serious. 
Eleanor wanted to write the book in a spiral shape. Each part is half the length of the part before it. The story gets faster as it goes on. I asked her if it matters if readers notice this. She said she wanted to create patterns in the book that readers could see if they wanted to.
Even with its unique structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery. Surprisingly, Eleanor did not know how the story would end before she wrote it. She would write herself into a difficult situation and then find a way out. She wanted to make the book fun for readers.
We also talked about her love for TV dramas. I asked if she would like to write for TV. She said, “That could be pretty cool.” She was very excited when she talked about her writing and New Zealand. 
Eleanor said that when she comes to Britain, her imagination changes because of the different landscape. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busy places with many people. But for now, New Zealand will still be her home. I hope it gives her inspiration for many more books."

When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has built acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny loves the guitar. He wonders how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound. He learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. Instead of saving money, he decided to make one himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood change the sound of the guitar.
Jonny built his first bass guitar, but he did not think about making guitars as a job. He also liked painting and sculpture. After school, he studied architecture because he liked design. But halfway through, he left school. He realized that building guitars was like making sculpture, but with sound. He thought it was a good job because people use the guitars he makes.
Jonny has made guitars for a living since then. For the first ten years, he cleaned windows to earn extra money. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials. As he became known as a good guitar maker, he could charge more money. Even now, after almost forty years, he says he is still just getting by. He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.
In the beginning, Jonny worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals and let musicians try his guitars. He also learned how to price his guitars because he did not know how to do this at first. Jonny thinks it is easier for new guitar makers today. When he started, many people thought only American guitars were good. Now, UK-made guitars are respected.
Jonny believes new guitar makers should take classes to learn important skills. However, he also thinks that learning by trying and making mistakes is very important. He says it is good to look at other instruments and see what works and what does not. If you make the back of a guitar too thin or too thick, it will not sound good. If you learn from someone else, you may only learn one way. But if you teach yourself, like Jonny did, you can learn many things."

When people talk in English, they often start with the weather. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said, ""When two English people meet, they first talk about the weather."" This is still true today. Many people wonder why English people talk about the weather so much. They think it is because English people really like the weather. 
An American writer, Bill Bryson, says that English weather is not very interesting. He points out that in England, there are no big storms like tornadoes or monsoons. However, a British broadcaster, Jeremy Paxman, disagrees. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that in England, you can never be sure what the weather will be like.
I think both Bryson and Paxman miss the real reason why English people talk about the weather. When they say things like, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are ways to start a conversation or fill a pause. 
Talking about the weather is like a special way for English people to connect with each other. There are three main times when they use weather talk: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a quiet moment. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather all the time. They might start with a weather greeting, then talk a little more about the weather, and go back to it if there is a pause in the conversation. This is why many people think English people are obsessed with the weather."

She wanted to explain how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall that is 120 km long and 5 metres high about 1900 years ago. The students were excited about this trip. They chose it instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. But they wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice felt she did not have good answers. She could not find a good book about the history of the wall, so she decided to write one herself. 
Alice stopped teaching after 31 years and started to write books in 2001. She felt nervous but excited about this new job. She said, “Teaching is like acting. It is hard work. Writing is exciting, but it is not so tiring.” Alice wanted to write books for children. She noticed that many books for young people are about sad things or are just fantasy, like Harry Potter. She wanted her books to be different.
Alice always taught English and History together. She loved to see when children went from being bored to being interested. She thought it was her job to make learning fun. She started to write her first book because she saw a need for it. Her two sons were leaving home, and her head teacher suggested she take a writing course. At first, Alice did not want to go to the course. 
Before the course, she had to send a story to the teachers. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours, she had 30 pages and sent it in. She was accepted into the course. The other students liked her story and told her to publish it. 
Alice asked her school head teacher for a year off to write her first book. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helped her by editing her work. Alice said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rivals, but I think we help each other. He changes my sentences and suggests new words. I like to add more scenes.”'"

To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race was between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and Alistair would ride a mountain bike across the hills. 
“I’m excited!” Jonny said at the start line. “I have never done this before. The views are beautiful, and it is very cold, so I can stay warm in the car.” Alistair was also excited, but he wore warm cycling clothes. “I have seen Jonny drive before,” he said. “I am not sure he will make it. I might stop for tea on the way.”
The race started at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, which is very high up. The car would have no problem, but Alistair had to ride up a steep hill first. They quickly shook hands and started the race. Alistair rode fast on his bike, while Jonny drove the car.
Just 15 seconds into the drive, Jonny had a problem. A big tractor came out of a field and blocked the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman. “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After the tractor was gone, Jonny drove on. 
Alistair was having a hard time. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill. Some sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top of the hill. The sun came out, and he started to ride fast again.
In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The roads in Yorkshire are old and narrow. He had to drive slowly around a tight corner and through a small stream on the road. After that, he could drive fast to the finish line. 
Neither brother knew who was ahead. Jonny drove quickly to Fleet Moss, while Alistair rode hard on the last part of his race. When Alistair reached the finish line, he looked around and asked, “Is he here?” When he found out Jonny was not there yet, he raised his arms and shouted, “Yes!”
A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, feeling sad. “I’m upset.”

The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass. You toss it up to serve and hit it, hearing the echo of your shot. The nice grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all make you feel safe and calm. The quiet helps my game. In a tennis match, I try to focus only on the game and the point I am playing. 
When a point ends, the silence breaks with noise: applause, cheers, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I do not think about the fifteen thousand people watching me. I am very focused and do not realize that millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me from a young age that this was the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I shared my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win.
Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer two times in the finals. The loss in 2006 was not so hard. I was happy to be there at twenty years old. Federer won easily. But my loss in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have played better. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance to win and lose. Toni, my tough coach, usually does not comfort me, but after that loss, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances to play at Wimbledon. I told him he did not understand; I thought it was my last chance to win. 
I know that a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the best of it. Every moment is important, but some moments are more important than others. I let a big chance pass in 2007. Toni could not help my sadness. But he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my loss. I believed I would win this time. 
The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we did not talk about the match. I did not tell them to stop, but they understood that I was already thinking about the match in my head. From then until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone."

Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. 
Many stories have been told about her life, but they often focus on her as a girl who loved adventure or a woman who wanted to work with animals. These stories do not show all her real achievements. Jane Goodall is a very important scientist. She helped us understand how chimpanzees live and feel. Before her work, people thought chimpanzees were very dangerous. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We did not know that they have feelings like humans or that they have social groups like ours. 
Jane Goodall wrote a book called The Chimpanzees of Gombe in 1986. This book is very important for chimpanzee research. Her study of chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is one of the great scientific achievements. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans. 
Even as a child, Jane showed signs of being a biologist. When she was five years old, she disappeared one day. The police and her family looked for her. After a long search, she came back with straw in her hair. Her mother asked where she had been. Jane said she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she hid in a henhouse for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This story shows the beginning of her love for animals.'"

In our first talk, Shirley Ford uses many funny voices. She sounds like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. People who watch children’s TV and cartoons know her voices. Shirley says, “I just did a voiceover about back injuries. I had to learn many medical words quickly.” 
Shirley talks about voiceovers. She says, “Many actors think they can do funny voices, and some can. But it is not just that. You must make the script exciting for people who cannot see you.” Many famous people want to do voiceovers. Producers invite them to try out, but they often do not get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.
After school, Shirley took a drama course. She wanted to be an actor. Sometimes, she sang jingles for TV ads. One day, the man at the recording studio asked her to try for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. She thought it was silly but tried it for fun and got the part. Shirley found out she could do voices and wanted to do voiceover work. 
In her second film, she played the main character and also her brother and mother. Women actors often do the voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter. It is hard to find child actors, so production companies prefer to use adult women. 
Shirley learned to make different sounds and to not always sound the same. She watches children’s TV to find new voices. She enjoys working on cartoons the most. “Sometimes, I have to sound excited about things I don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I learned to smile while talking. It makes my voice sound happy.” 
The competition for voiceover work is tough. A good showreel, which shows what an artist can do, is very important. Shirley says, “It is worth making a strong showreel. There are agencies that help voiceover artists with this.” She believes she is successful because she works hard and has talent. 
For people who want to do voiceovers, Shirley suggests going to special workshops. She thinks it is important to love voices. She says, “If I do an American voice in the studio, I might talk like that for hours or days after.” Her children are used to her talking in different voices."

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because many kids dream of being cartoonists, like they dream of being race car drivers. But most people stop dreaming and choose other jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make money by drawing funny pictures. But some people do it.
Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way. Most cartoonists have wanted to do this for a long time. I loved comic strips as a kid, drew for my school, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college. After I finished school, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live.
You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a college degree or a lot of money. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it was that easy, there would be many more cartoonists. It is not an easy job. It is better to have a regular job that pays well and gives you time for family and hobbies.
The more skills you have, the better chance you have to make a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also written, drawn caricatures, and designed. I take any job because you can learn a lot from work you don’t want to do. It helps to be smart and curious about the world.
What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. Now, most cartoonists have to sell their own work. If you are good at selling, you will do better. I have seen cartoonists who are not very creative but are good at business do better than very talented artists who do not know how to sell.
Some people worry too much about others stealing their ideas. They are so scared that they won’t even show their work to anyone! To protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But really, it is more likely that no one will care about your work. If someone does take your cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it can be a lucky chance!"

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar from Japan. I usually do not like to throw things away, so I felt bad about this. I took it to the dump and was going to put it in the trash when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and said, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and he asked if he could have it. I said “Yes,” and we went our separate ways.
After that day, I felt sad about giving away my guitar. A few months ago, I opened an email that changed everything. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean. Ten years later, he found it in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I read the email from a man named Keith Rushton. He said, “I have your electric guitar.” 
The guitar had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name on a label on the guitar. He used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and wanted to sell it back to me. I was very happy. I would have given him anything for it, but his price was fair. I remembered how my dad liked to put name labels on my things, even my guitar.
My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calm and gentle. But I did not get better at it, so I switched to electric guitar and played easy songs. At that time, punk music was also popular, and anyone could be a rock star, even if they could not play well.
When I opened the box with my old guitar, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding the guitar again felt smooth and nice. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap on my shoulder because electric guitars are played while standing. My fingers remembered where to go. I could not draw the chords, but my hands knew how to play. My fingers felt a little pain from pressing the strings.
The electric guitar is not usually played alone. Now that I am learning it again, I think I should start a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who want to play. We could call ourselves “The Regainers!”"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. I wrote a book called Insomniac about people who cannot sleep. I wanted to tell people about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and feelings. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is. It is good that people are talking about sleep now. 
But what about dreams? I do not hear much about dreams. We lose dreams all the time. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss the last hour or two of sleep. This lost sleep is mostly REM sleep, which is when we dream a lot. Our best and most memorable dreams happen in REM sleep just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. If a person lives for 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM sleep. 
When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they dream more the next night. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep. Many people agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that dreams help us understand our minds. But later studies showed that this was not so simple. Now, researchers focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. 
Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University, says that researchers do not agree on many things about dreams. Dreams are important. At a meeting of sleep experts, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study. This study found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. Pagel thinks that people who are creative use their dreams more. 
Stickgold says that dreams help us think in new ways. They help us connect ideas from the past and present. For example, when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to think of a word, their answers are more original than when they wake from other sleep stages. They think of surprising ideas. Stickgold says this is creativity. 
I also write better when I wake up from strong dreams. Even a bad dream can help me think better. On those days, my ideas come out quickly. I do not know how it works, but it does help. Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We all need to think well in our complex world. We need to dream to help us think creatively and solve problems with others."
38,B2,"'Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small town by the sea in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see empty frames on the walls and happy pictures of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist. She can copy famous paintings very well. “I don’t keep my own paintings,” Susie says. “As soon as I finish them, I sell them.” Many people want her work. In her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted many famous artists’ works, like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies look so real that experts sometimes think they are the originals. The real paintings can sell for millions of pounds, but her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she works on them. Susie does not tell many names of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors want to show off their art. One famous buyer likes to say he has a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. “Many famous people say my copies are originals,” she says. “That is their choice.” Some collectors keep the original painting in a safe place and show Susie’s copy at home. Susie is honest about her work. When she copies a painting, she tries to make it look very real. She believes it is important to respect the original artist. She puts her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real painting, and even though some people do this, Susie does not want to. She knows that people who make fake art can get into trouble. Susie is not rich, but she is more secure now. She does not want to risk her good name with collectors and artists. 
Before being a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after finishing her art degree. She did not earn much money, but it helped her learn important skills. She had to be very careful and get things right the first time. She is happy she found a job that pays better. When young artists ask her for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and to be accurate. She has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants and make copies of old paintings, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie thinks many people believe modern art is easy. However, impressionists painted quickly but also paid attention to detail. This combination is hard to do. 
Some people wonder why Susie does not create her own art. Isn’t art about expressing yourself? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? Susie says her work comes from many years of practice, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried to create her own art before. Once, she painted fishing nets, but they looked like photographs, which was nice but not special. It is like eating plain food after having meals made by a great chef. Susie is a perfectionist.'"

Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything else when she was a racer. She wanted to be the fastest person on the water. Since she was a child, the sea was her big dream. She felt very close to her boats. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, life felt boring. People wanted to know about her races, but she just wanted to be back on the ocean, facing nature, even in places that were very hard for her.
After she came second in a big race called the Vendée Globe, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She lived in this tiny space for 94 days. She talked about how she planned everything carefully, even how many rolls of paper towels she needed. She said preparation was very important. She showed me her food, a small stove, and bags of medical supplies. She took care of her boat because her life depended on it.
Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat. It is small and beautiful, but it can be damaged. She had a big change in her life when she went to South Georgia, a lonely island. There, she helped with a study of albatross birds. This made her think differently. She saw many old whaling stations and felt it was a warning. She thought we take what we want and then leave.
When I visited Ellen’s office, she was finishing a call. She told me we need to save the planet now. “We cannot make more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious. We need to find ways to not use everything up,” she said. At first, she said we should use less, but then she found a better way to think. Now, she talks about re-using things, like special carpet tiles.
For three years, she has been visiting factories and talking to people about using less non-renewable resources. She said, “I will never be an expert, but I love learning. I cannot ignore what is happening now. Sailing felt selfish compared to this. I want to find out how I can help.”
Ellen started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a better future. She said, “I miss the adventure of being at sea. It is part of who I am. When I am sailing, I feel connected to everything. I focus on the race and survival. My new message is not as simple as saying, ‘I will be the fastest around the world.’ I was fast, but this work is more important than anything I have done.”

Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does this, he could be very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games. Jordan hopes to inspire kids to go outside and climb their own mountains. 
Jordan's team for the climb is his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Few people do this before they are thirty years old. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he turns 20.
Some famous climbers think it is not a good idea to take a 13-year-old up Mount Everest. They believe Jordan is strong, but they worry he may not be emotionally ready. They also think he may not have enough experience to climb safely. 
Paul says, “I know people criticize us, but we have to keep going. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.” 
Paul also thinks about why Jordan wants to climb. He says, “This is not about me wanting to be famous. At first, Jordan wanted to do this later, but we thought, ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him to make sure he still wants to do it.” 
When asked what he enjoys about the challenge, Jordan says, “I just focus on my goal.” 
In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest climber. Now, every adventure is shared online, and people want to break records. This makes Jordan’s climb more exciting but also more complicated. If he wants to inspire others, he needs to share his journey online, take photos, and give interviews. 
Paul says, “If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.”

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Many people can name many pop groups, but most of my friends do not know who Brahms is. I just started studying music, but the people in my class know as little about classical music as other teenagers. If you do not know who wrote the music, you probably do not have any of their recordings. This is sad for people who love classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and most classical recordings sell only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe.
Why is there less interest in classical music? Older people are upset about our love for TV and video games, but I do not think this is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not attract many people, especially teenagers, who buy most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I do not really like classical music. I enjoy many types of music, but I listen to classical music very little.
So, why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, classical music has many changes in mood and rhythm, which can be hard for us. We like fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical music pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs more time and focus. Also, pop music is more interesting to teenagers than long classical pieces without words. 
The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? Some teachers say that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I think not many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. 
Some people say that schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They like classical music when they play it, but it is not their favorite music. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music. 
**Questions:**
1. What type of music do most teenagers listen to?
2. Who is Brahms?
3. What percentage of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music?
4. Why do teenagers find classical music hard to listen to?

42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I will make you sorry I came here,” she said to the school. Her mother did not hear her because she was getting out of the car too. Bonnie didn’t care if her mother heard. Her mother knew how Bonnie felt. 
Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden in the trees. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gym, riding center. “Riding center,” said Bonnie, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” said her mother. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. 
“I wish you would walk beside me instead of behind me,” said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she did not expect Bonnie to do so. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she said to herself. “I will be thrown out soon anyway,” she thought, “so why not go now?” She left the building and went to the riding center. 
There was a nice old building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She walked carefully to the horses. Bonnie treated horses with respect. The horses were well cared for. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one. “I know what you are doing here,” she said to a small pony, touching its nose. 
Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best!” she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we have met before,” she said, petting his neck. His name was Maverick. Bonnie wanted to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. 
The room with the riding equipment was open. Happy to find it, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on Maverick outside, she felt like a queen. Her old school nickname was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You are the best horse I have ever ridden, Maverick,” she said. “I know about horses.” 
She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and a little breeze made her cheek feel warm. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."

I met Cody Simpson before. He is a quiet and confident person. Cody is 15 years old and comes from Australia. He has made many successful songs. How did a surfer boy end up on a big stage? 
Cody says, “I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old. I started writing songs when I was seven.” He loved swimming and surfing more than anything else. When he was 13, he went to high school and posted some videos online. These videos changed everything. He started with a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Many fans wanted to see more videos of him. So, Cody made more videos at home. 
Cody was also a great swimmer. He trained hard with good coaches. But then, record labels wanted him to sing. He had to choose: stay in Australia and keep swimming or move to the US to sing. Cody decided to take the risk. 
“It was hard for me to choose a career at such a young age,” he says. “Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to decide what to do for the rest of your life?” He told his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. They were surprised because he is a quiet kid. 
Cody packed his bags and moved with his family. They are not in the spotlight, but they support him. Cody thinks it is important to have good people around you. 
Sometimes, he worries about his little brother and sister. His brother is eight years old and travels with him. “I think about how my decision affects him,” Cody says. “But my family always supports me.” 
Success comes from saying “yes” to big opportunities, even if it is scary. Cody says, “Everything happened so fast. Now, I go to countries I never thought I would visit and play for many fans. It is a dream for many people, but I know it won’t last forever.”"

I jumped out of bed and looked out the window. I saw the river. There was a crack in the ice shining in the morning sun. I looked up the river at the sandbags. They were there to stop the water from flooding the buildings as the ice melted. My back hurt from moving the sandbags. Last week, I worked with many people in the town for a long time. I wanted to show I could help. My grandfather did not notice much. 
I looked at the dark water from the factory. There was ice on both sides of the water. I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit. I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. He was trying to balance on the ice near the warm water. I zipped up my wetsuit and put on my kayaking jacket. I checked my pocket for my lucky chain. It is a silver chain my famous grandfather gave me. Only my grandfather, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from his trip to South America. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. 
I patted the chain and went to the kitchen. “Good morning, Rex,” my mom said. She smiled at me as I took a banana from the counter. “You are up early for a Saturday. I will make brunch after your training. Be careful.” “Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hall and almost bumped into my tall grandfather. “Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” “Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” He should know that by now. 
“Why train? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt me. I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went to the bathroom and slammed the door. My mom came to me with a kind smile. “Don’t worry about him. He’s…” “...not himself right now,” I said. I wanted to say he was always like this, but I didn’t. I try to be nice to him. When I was little, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old pictures are still on his wall with his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at. Maybe one day, my face will be in National Geographic too. 
A part of me still wants to care for him, even if he is grumpy. My mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your hard work, even in the cold!” I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went outside. I hurried to the boathouse in the backyard."
45,B2,"'Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, there was a painting by Grandpa. It was not finished and looked different from his other paintings. “Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” 
Jess looked at the painting. There was a river in it. It was not a river she knew, maybe it was not real. The painting was strange and beautiful. The riverbank was very small, with a little green. The river looked pale and seemed to go to a hidden sea. There were no animals, no birds, and no people. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after summer.
Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed she was excited. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them: “River Boy.” The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 
Jess looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” 
“Exactly. It’s strange for him to be so specific. Maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” 
“Mum! You should have known better.” 
“I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.” 
Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew Grandpa would say, “It’s not up to the artist to explain a painting. Each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. Painting is hard work without explaining it to everyone.” 
Mum laughed. “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.” 
“Inspire?” 
“Someone who helps an artist.” Jess knew what it meant. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint. But she thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to think anyone could inspire Grandpa. 
“He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He has painted all his life.”'"

This morning, I woke up and did not mean to cut a hole in my carpet. I might have tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand. The knife could have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I did not want to damage the carpet. I did not wake up and think, “Today I will cut my carpet.” It seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. 
I was not thinking about cutting the carpet. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small and painted white with pink and blue flowers. Gran used to keep pretty things in it. I keep my shells and stones there. I was very happy when Gran gave it to me! 
The cabinet is a corner cabinet, so it has to stand in a corner. My bedroom is small and has only two corners. The big bedroom is for Mum and Dad, the back room is for my sister Angela, and the little room is for my brother Tom. My room is very small, like a broom cupboard. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have Tom’s room. But Angela is only fifteen, so I will be in my small room for a long time. 
I like my little bedroom. It is cozy, like a nest. The roof slopes down, and the window is low. The problem is, I do not have many corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet in the space between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. I thought, if I cannot cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. Dad always tells us to “think outside the box.” That is what I was trying to do!"
47,B2,"'The novel ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of tiny people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show from the book, I knew it would be hard to make everyone happy. People who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book because I did not want people to say I did it wrong. The author wanted the show to show the Borrowers' view, not the humans', which made filming harder. 
The most important thing was to show the right size. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans. So, when we filmed the Borrowers walking or going on missions, we had to be ten times further away than usual. When filming the human world, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low, about 15 centimeters high. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for special shots. 
One big problem was making the shadows look right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We made a special way to do this. After the show, famous director George Lucas called to ask how we did it. We built only one set, the Borrowers' home under the floor, with big objects to make the actors look small. It was very fun. I remember the coins were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much. 
In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. To film this, actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and it was so scary they did not have to act. It was important to me to get the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to move. She could not sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming. I don’t think they liked me for the costumes!
Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to act with things that were not really there. I drew pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I drew 2,000 pictures! The budget was low, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work fast – I once filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera. But in the end, everything came together, and I think the show was successful in showing the magic of the books.'"
48,B2,"'Mom stops the car at my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, but there are no journalists. I know that soon there will be people wanting to talk to me. I tell her, “Everything will be fine.” She kisses my cheek before I get out of the car. Now I am alone at this new school. But I wanted this. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. I want to meet real kids. I want to meet kids with normal parents, like a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be cool.
I walk into the school office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks. She looks unfriendly. “Desert McGraw,” I say. “Desirée?” she asks, confused. “No, Desert,” I repeat. She types my last name on her computer. “What grade?” she asks. “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she says. She gives me my schedule. My first class is English Literature. I like English. I will be late because the class is on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I would not get lost.
When I get to the classroom, the teacher is taking attendance. I quietly enter and sit at the back. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my jeans and T-shirt. “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes. Oh no, I should not have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher calls my name. “Desert McGraw?” she says. “Here,” I reply. The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After that, she lets us talk to each other.
“Why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few answers. I could say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters. Or I could say what my dad said: “We need a change, Desert. This is the perfect place to record the new album.” I think he just wants to relax on the beach. “My dad had to move here,” I tell her. “What does he do?” she asks. I know everyone will find out soon, but I want to pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” She seems not to care much. That’s fine.'"

Today, many American teenage girls are expected to do a lot. They should be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, and help others by volunteering. They also need to do well in school. Being a teenager in America is not easy. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average. They must work hard and have big goals. 
Kristen Loose, a teenager, says, “People forget how much pressure we have. We have a lot of homework, tests, jobs, chores, and we want to have friends too.” Even with all this stress, some people still think teenagers are lazy or disrespectful. Kristen thinks this is not fair. She says, “Many people think we only watch TV or use our phones all the time.” 
Kristen uses her phone for more than just texting. It helps her with schoolwork and makes life easier. Today, students can do homework anywhere because of smartphones and tablets. They can listen to lessons while going to school. Schoolwork does not stop when they leave school; it is always there. 
Many teenagers wake up early, around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., and go to bed late, often after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation says that only about 20 percent of teenagers get enough sleep at night. 
Lindamarie Olsen, another teenager, says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, that is not much time. She does not spend her free time on social media or TV. Instead, she likes to volunteer. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves, but I love helping others.” 
In the future, teenagers will still work hard and show the world that they can make a difference."

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers. They live in Bishop, a small town in the US near big mountains. This group has sent over fifty balloons high into the sky, about 35 km above the Earth. They do this as a science project and for fun. I joined them one weekend in spring. They were going to release a balloon to see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space falls into the Earth’s atmosphere and makes a bright light.
As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft lunch box to the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a tool to measure how high the balloon goes, and a thermometer to check the temperature. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to find it later. They used a gas tank to fill the balloon, which got very big, like a small car. An older boy drove for seven hours to get the gas tank. He said, “I didn’t really mind.” 
Finally, it was time to launch the balloon. They counted down, “Five, four, three, two, one,” and the balloon went up into the sky. Some of the teenagers ran to follow it with flashlights. They felt excited and amazed. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets and looked at the clear sky. 
I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. One girl said quietly, “We’re the only ones talking.” Another girl whispered, “I know.” Suddenly, a meteor flew across the sky. As the balloon went up, it got bigger until it popped. A parachute helped the lunch box come back safely to the ground. The next day, the students used the GPS trackers to find it. It was not easy to get back, but that was part of the fun. 
The lunch box usually lands in a place with no people around. The leader of the group said, “Recoveries are a big part of the program.” They had lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km from Bishop. The team had to drive and walk to find it. It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not catch any shooting stars. This was a little disappointing, but it gave them a chance to talk about science and share their adventure stories. 
**Questions:**
1. Where does the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live?
2. How high do the balloons go?
3. What do they hope to see when they release the balloon?
4. What is inside the lunch box?
5. How long did it take to find the lunch box?"

Chloe Morgan did not like science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen years old. It happened by chance. Her younger brother loved dinosaurs, but she did not care about them. One day, she helped him with a science project. While doing this, she found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. It amazed her, and she wanted to learn more.
Chloe met her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius. He was young and already famous. At first, she was very nervous. She thought he might think she was just a silly kid asking too many questions. But he was kind and listened to her, which made her feel better.
Chloe talked about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. She said that films like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs, but they do not show palaeontologists correctly. They often show them as strange or funny people who cannot talk to others. Chloe wants people to know what palaeontologists really do. 
Her job is very different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, studies fossils, and writes for science magazines. Sometimes, she talks to the public about science. She thinks it is important to explain science to young people. Talking about dinosaurs can help children learn about nature and science.
Chloe worked on a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She helped make sure the dinosaurs were shown correctly. She checked that the dinosaurs were the right size and shape and that they lived at the same time. The show was popular because it showed dinosaurs in a new way, different from movies like Jurassic Park.
Chloe believes dinosaurs are still interesting because they make us curious. They remind us that there is still much to discover in the world. Palaeontology is like time travel to the past."

When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not “there yet.” You keep asking, “Are we there yet?” But when you arrive, it is not “there” anymore; it is “here.” If you think you are “there,” you should ask, “Are we here yet?” 
Parents hear this question many times on long car trips. Kids might think it is hard, but it can be nice to sit in the back seat. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the scenery outside. 
In the front seat, mum or dad drives the car. They give juice boxes and cookies and change the radio. They help make the trip nice. 
But sometimes, things can get crazy. My younger brother, Tim, likes to bother me. He puts his foot on my side of the seat. I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and mum or dad has to stop us. They tell Tim to stay in his seat. 
After a while, I try to read, but I feel something on my arm. Tim is blowing his breath on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. This makes me angry. 
Dad has some funny answers to the question “Are we there yet?” Sometimes he says, “Yes, we are here. Get out of the car.” But we are still driving. Then he says, “Maybe we are not there yet.” This makes us quiet for a bit. 
You know you are really “there” when the grown-ups get out of the car and walk away from the kids. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you are not there yet."

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi want people to enjoy their time and come back again. Zuzi says they started this café because they love board games. She thinks many people spend too much time on their phones and computers. They want to help people talk and have fun together.
The games in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games have simple themes, like farming and building. The first Eurogame was called The Settlers of Catan, made by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build towns on an island and trade things with each other. Everyone can play together and feel included.
Another popular Eurogame is Pandemic. In this game, players work together to solve problems in the world. It was created by Matt Leacock, a North American designer. He was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings. Matt remembers playing it with friends and feeling scared but happy at the end, no matter who won or lost. 
Matt loved board games as a child, but sometimes he felt disappointed when they were not fun. With help from his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular and had a great story. It is like a video game because players can develop their characters and the story changes.
The video game industry has helped board games become popular again. Many people play games on their phones now. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone plays games on their phones. More people are open to playing games than before.
At first, video games allowed people to play together in the same room. But then, many games moved online, and players could not see each other. Some people wanted to play games with friends in person again. In John and Zuzi's busy café, board games are more than just fun. In our online world, games are a way for people to share time together in real life. This trend will continue."

Jamie Scott is a musician from the UK. He has written many popular songs. His story shows that hard work and not giving up are important in music, even if you start slowly. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. He only listened to a local radio station at home, which played music for older people. Because of this, he did not hear new songs until he was 12 years old.

Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is a big star online, but many people do not know him if they do not watch online videos. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other strange places. People film his jumps and put them online.
I meet Tony in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys know who he is. Some older people come to talk to him and say he is ""an absolute legend."" After watching him, I agree. I thought he might not be good, but I see he is very brave and creative. Before each jump, he tells me what he will do, and sometimes I think he cannot do it. When I tell him he did well, he does not seem very happy.
Tony says he does not like being famous. He finds it hard to talk to fans. He prefers to do things instead of just talking about them. This is funny because he is famous because of social media and cameras. He says, ""This technology helps people like me make money."" He feels that many people are always filming themselves or looking at screens, and he does not like that.
Tony makes good money from his videos. He says that to be a great athlete, you need energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These things are often more important than talent. The riskier the sport, the more you need to be strong in your mind. Even in the park, Tony falls sometimes, but he gets up and keeps trying until he can do it.
Some people think Tony is a hero, but others say he is reckless and takes too many risks. He says, ""People who say this may care, but they do not understand. They probably have never tried riding a trials bike and do not know the sport."" Tony is careful about risks. He says, ""Some people are not scared, and they should not do these sports. It is smart to know the dangers. I feel scared, but I find a way to keep going. I am not addicted to risk. I plan a lot and sometimes ride around to get ready before a jump. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus, I will be fine."""
56,B1,"'Helen Skelton is a TV presenter. She has done many dangerous things for charity. She ran a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her new challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 metres above the ground, between two tall towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net. She wore a belt attached to another wire above her. To help her balance, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 
Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. She had some circus skills, but high-wire walking was very different. Helen said, “The training was a shock. I didn’t know I needed to be so strong.” Every day, she started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then, she did exercises for one hour and practiced on the wire for another hour. She also learned how to fall safely on the wire. When she fell, it hurt a lot. But she knew it was important to stay positive. If she was nervous, the wire would shake too!
On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths and moved step by step on the wire. The 150-metre walk took 15 minutes. Afterward, she said, “That was the scariest thing I’ve done. I’m glad it’s over!” But Helen is not done. She is planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"

Jeff had already written a book about his travels in Canada in a 50-year-old car. He loved cars and worked on racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work. He also used it to go to Amsterdam for a holiday. “That trip opened my eyes,” he says. “I wanted to see the world by bike.” Jeff did not want a normal bike. He wanted to build a special one. “The craziest bike I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to a museum to learn how they were made.” After two tries in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally started his trip in 2006. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. “I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, but I never regretted my penny farthing. People were amazed by it.” His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in a hostel for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. But now, Jeff says, “If I could afford it, I would travel again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”'"

She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills. Students learn to juggle, throw, and catch things like balls. They also learn trapeze, which is flying in the air above an audience. 
The course lasts one year. Students take more risks as they learn. Parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia says, “To be a circus performer, you need to do different things. It is important to keep performances exciting. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must practice a lot. 
Another good thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is very important too. Circus artists train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers want to succeed, have new ideas, and keep improving their skills. 
Some people think circus performers get hurt a lot or only work a little each year. But the real challenge is thinking about the future. You can perform when you are young, but later you need to think about other jobs.” The course also teaches business planning. Many past students start their own businesses around the world and share their stories. Sophia warns that this job is not for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not have a regular salary. It is also very competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”'"

It was very hard because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, and there was an orchestra too. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are long enough already.”

We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish, and I did not know many of them. It was nice to forget about time. We always remembered to eat lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it felt good to relax.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be entertaining and tell good stories. It is important to handle changes, like if a place is closed when you arrive. Tourists want to enjoy their tour, not hear about problems. I want my visitors to be happy, or they might leave a bad review online. Good reviews are important because they help me get more customers. I try to make my tours fun and easy. I put a lot of energy into my job, so my reviews are usually very good, and many people recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago."""
68,B1,"""My name is Ella. I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was nervous because the other volunteers were older than us. It was also our first time doing this kind of work. But in the end, we had a great time.
One of our main jobs was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I liked seeing the elephants eat. We also washed the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants!
In the evening, we led the elephants into the forest where they slept. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she did not want to be alone. It was hot at night, but we were ready for that. The food was very good and did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, we all talked and played games.
Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk about Thailand much. But if someone asks her if she liked the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little sad because she missed her friends. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I will for sure!"""
69,B1,"""My name is Gina D’Costa. I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many people. Some people buy flowers for friends or their homes. Hotels and offices also buy flowers. Sometimes, we help businesses by providing flowers for their pictures. Once, I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.
My day starts at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark, but I do not let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. It can be hard to choose flowers. My favorite color is pink, so I would choose pink flowers for myself. But I have to remember that other people may want different flowers. Not all flowers are available all year.
I do not like to argue about prices with the flower sellers, but I have to do it. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then, we make bunches of flowers and calculate the cost. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes ask them to think again about what they want. Some people may think this is too much work, but I enjoy making beautiful flower arrangements for the money someone wants to spend. I love my job!"""
70,B1,"""My city has a modern cinema that shows new films. It also shows many films for kids on weekends. The cinema is close to my home. A year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about films with other people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film about Antarctica. It was very cold, and this made the film even better! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money. Each time we show a film, it gets easier for us, especially now we have our own equipment. We can see how many tickets we sell online, so we don’t worry about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great time, it makes us happy. Our website helps us a lot, and we talk to other film clubs in the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but we love coming back to our own club! We also started a blog because many people look online for film information instead of reading local papers. We put up some posters in cafés, too. But the best way to get new people is when others tell their friends about us. The audience loves the fun activities we have with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""
71,B1,"""When I was a child, I loved taking photographs. When I was 15, I wanted to do something special with my hobby. I decided to take one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone suggested that I should have a common theme for my photos. I agreed and started to take more photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing. They were taking color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I trusted myself and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I was so happy when I won first prize! This moment made me realize that my photography was good, and I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I am happy with my choice."""
72,B1,"""I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try new things like camping and sailing. In NYC, you can do many activities and learn new skills. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers help us. When you finish a level, you get a certificate.
At first, my leader said I should help at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure about this because I had joined that club when I was eight. I found it hard to make friends then, and I stopped going. But I decided to try this challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate.
Soon, I loved spending time at the children’s club. It was more important to me than just getting a certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club. I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.
Because of what I learned at the club, I want to go to college after school to become a youth worker. I never thought about this job before. This has been my favorite part of NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one is for camping!"""

The hill was very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and did not think to ask him if I could start. He loved snowboarding and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. Soon, I loved snowboarding and got better at it. I started to compete when I was ten years old. Some people compete a lot and get bored, but I still love it. I like to win, and this helps me try harder. I enjoy not having a strict plan. Sometimes this works well, like when I got a perfect score at a local competition. I was not sure I could do the jumps, but I tried. This made me trust myself more. In summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I do not have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend time with my friends. This helps me feel better when I cannot snowboard. I think about my future. Snowboarding is very important to me, but I want to have another job too, just in case I do not become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time to go to college. I cannot imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I cannot snowboard forever."""
74,B1,"""When I was fifteen, I wanted the same things as my friends. I did not think about the future. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could have one if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for this. It taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I did not enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it would be hard, but it was easy. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. My mum showed me how to make pretty things at home with simple tools. I sold my first jewellery to my friends and family. They said they liked it, but I was not sure if it was good enough. I wanted to know if other people would like it too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists came to buy my jewellery for their families and friends. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum! That is when I knew my business could work. I decided to make a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun!"""
75,B1,"'When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s life. In an interview, Janine said, “Because my father’s job, my family moved a lot. I learned to make new friends. I know what it is like to be the new student in a class. This helped me write about Amelia, the main character, in a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially with her older brother. I am an only child, so I had to use my imagination to write that.” 
Janine started her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother wanted to be a writer, and her teachers told her to write, so writing was a good way to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story competition on a young writers’ website. That is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they wanted to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores. 
One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover has pictures of happy teenagers, the characters face some hard problems. This makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that even if Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many other famous authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people saw me in the street, but now it is OK. I want to help other young writers, but they must find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and I will have something interesting to write about!”'"
76,B1,"""My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father got a job as the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings. He was happy to get this job, but it took time for us to agree. We were worried about living on the island. We thought the castle would not be as nice as our home, and there was no school there. 
After we moved, we got used to island life. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. In summer, the island is busy with many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we see only a few other families who live on the island. There are not many teenagers, which is sad for me. The adults help each other with work on the island.
The biggest change for me is taking a boat to my old school every day. I like going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then. If I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is scary. When my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! 
The views are amazing, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days it is very foggy, and you cannot see anything. But then, in a few hours, it can be sunny again. This is still amazing to me. We do have strong storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle is safe. But I remember it has been here for many years, and it is still standing!"""
77,B1,"""I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in nature. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They taught me how to tell different birds apart and where to find them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species. I am close to my goal because I have seen birds in other countries, too. We look for places with birdwatching activities so I can see new birds! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there, but I didn’t. I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I made a video about my challenge, and many teenagers liked it. They said it looked fun. My teachers asked me to give a talk about birdwatching at school. I was nervous before I went on stage. I knew what to say and had notes, but many people were watching me! I felt better when it was over. The teachers said I did well and they liked it. I might do another talk next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why some teenagers in cities do not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it does not have to cost a lot of money."""
78,B1,"""I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and I got better at it. My family thought I would stop playing like I did with other hobbies, but I didn’t. I dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. 
One day, I played in a local tournament. A referee saw me play and told the manager of a women’s club to watch me. The manager asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at football.
Some people were not sure I would be a star player, and this made me a little sad. But my coach told me to believe in myself. He let me play in an important match earlier than I thought I would. I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal! I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! 
Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament for teenagers. We want to get them interested in football and help them meet other players. They will see what it is like to play professionally and feel they can play for a top team if they work hard. I will tell them what my coach told me – there will be good times and bad times. I have had very few bad times, so I feel lucky!"""

In the UK and other countries, schools and universities want students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research skills are important for studying and for jobs because they help us think about the world and do our work better.
As a student, you help create knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say. You ask questions like: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are important for research. 
Research can be very complex, but it can also be simple. It starts with asking questions and looking for answers. Most students have done some research before. You have asked questions for school projects or at work. You have also done research when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training your dog, or shopping online.
In college and university, you are expected to ask questions, think critically, and explore information. Some students may find this hard because in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. They may think they should only listen to teachers and books. However, in many places like the UK, US, and Europe, it is okay to question what you learn and who teaches you.
Doing research can be challenging. Critical thinking is very important. We should not just repeat what we read. We need to think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. We should not just accept everything we are told without questioning it."
80,C2,"'Cities have always been important places for ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafés. But living in a city is not easy. The same cafés in London that helped people talk also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 
Today, cities are full of creativity, but they can also be overwhelming. Scientists are studying how city life affects our brains. They found that living in a city can make it hard to think clearly. One reason is that cities have less nature. Studies show that hospital patients get better faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a little bit of nature helps our brains relax and work better.
More people now live in cities than in the countryside. We are packed into busy places with many strangers. This crowded life can affect our mental and physical health. When we walk in a busy city, our brains have to pay attention to many things, like people and traffic. This can make us feel tired because our brains are always working hard to focus.
Natural places are easier for our brains. This idea is called attention restoration theory. Psychologist Stephen Kaplan said that being in nature helps our brains recover. Nature has things that catch our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like sirens. 
Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and city planners warned about city life and wanted to add more nature to cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A good park can help our brains feel better quickly. 
Many people look for ways to improve how we think, like energy drinks or new office designs, but walking in nature is often the best way. With many mental problems caused by city life, we wonder why cities keep growing. 
Research shows that crowded streets and many people can also lead to new ideas. The many social interactions in cities help creativity. Just like crowded London in the 18th century led to new ideas, busy places today can also be creative. 
The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. Sometimes, people feel tired of nature and want to go back to the city!'"

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange. We usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have special machines to see what happens in our brains. But I believe we should not only look inside our heads. Many things around us also help us think. 
For example, tools, decorations, drawings, and writing have all helped humans grow and change. This means that what is outside our heads can also be part of our mind. Many scientists study the brain by keeping people away from the things they usually use. This is good for studying the brain, but it can make us forget that we think with the help of things around us.
I do not want to say that the brain is not important. I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. We should think about how our intelligence connects with culture and the things we use. I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). This idea looks at how objects help us think. For example, when we use clay to make numbers or use a stone to make a tool, these objects help our minds.
This idea also looks at how our thinking has changed over time. It helps us understand what minds are and how they work with things. Think about a blind person using a stick. The stick helps the person feel and understand the world. The brain can see the stick as part of the body. This shows that our minds can change and grow when we use new tools.
My idea sees the mind as something that is always changing. The stick, whether it is a simple tool or a smartphone, helps us learn and understand our world. Humans are different from other animals because we make things, and these things help shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity. Our minds can change as we interact with the world around us. 
MET helps us understand how different tools, from old stone tools to new technology, can change how we think. Technology may seem new and exciting, but humans have been using it to change their minds for a long time. 
**Questions:**
1. Where do we usually think thinking happens?
2. What is the name of the new idea the author talks about?
3. How does a blind person use a stick?
4. What does the author mean by metaplasticity?
5. Why are humans different from other animals according to the text?"
82,C1,"""Photography is an important invention that has changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It is used in many ways, like science, industry, and art. Many people believe that photography is one of the best contributions of the US to the visual arts. 
Photography became popular in the mid-19th century. People liked it because it used machines, which matched their interest in new technology. Just like trains and electricity made travel easier, photography brought images of the world into homes. The camera helped people show who they were and share their lives with others. It also helped families keep memories, even if those memories were not always real.
A photograph shows what the photographer wants us to see. It is different from a drawing because it is made by a machine. This means photographs can show real events, people, and things. However, the person taking the photo also influences what we see. We might think we understand a photo because we know the subject, but the meaning of a photo can be more complicated.
To understand a photograph, we need to know why it was taken and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things in different places and times. 
In recent years, artists have used photographs in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his art. Now, photography is seen as an important part of art, not just separate from painting."""

In 1890, William James was an American philosopher and doctor. He is one of the founders of modern psychology. He said that psychology is the ""science of mental life."" This means it studies how we think and feel. We all have thoughts and feelings, and we can understand them in our own way. 
William James was very interested in human psychology. He believed it has basic parts: our thoughts, our feelings, and the world around us. Our knowledge about these things is personal. It comes from our own experiences and may not always match scientific facts. Because of this, we often make judgments about psychology based on our own experiences. 
Sometimes, two people can understand things differently. Psychology tries to find the best explanations for different situations. Psychologists help us see the difference between our personal thoughts and scientific facts. They study the mind and the brain, but they do not know everything about how the brain works. 
Psychologists learn more by watching how people behave. They use these observations to make ideas about what happens inside us. It is hard to study the mind directly, like we can study a machine. We can only see the mind through behavior. 
Studying psychology is like solving a puzzle. It needs careful observation and logical thinking. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and change behavior. When psychologists reach these goals, they can help us understand our experiences better. 
Psychology has helped in many areas, like teaching children to read, making machines safer, and helping people express their feelings. Although people have talked about psychological questions for a long time, real scientific study started only 150 years ago. Early psychologists looked at their own thoughts to find answers, but this method has limits. 
Today, psychologists prefer to observe others' behavior instead of just thinking about their own experiences."

In a storehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. Some examples are A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry runs the museum and believes that each product has a sad story about the people who tried to sell it.
The museum is surprising because it makes money. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products. Robert McMath started the museum in the 1960s. He wanted to collect new products, not just the ones that failed. He learned that most products do not succeed. 
The museum shows how people often think positively about new products. They have meetings where they believe the products will be successful, even if they are not. Sometimes, marketers spend more money on a product that is not selling well, hoping to make it better. 
There is a popular idea called ""positive visualization."" This means if you think good things will happen, they might happen. Some scientists believe that people are naturally optimistic. However, research shows that thinking too much about good outcomes can actually make people less motivated to work hard. 
Psychologist Carol Dweck says that how we see failure affects us. Some people think ability is something you are born with, while others believe you can improve with effort. People who think they are naturally good at something feel worse when they fail. On the other hand, those who believe they can grow from challenges see failure as a chance to learn. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles get stronger by being pushed. Having a growth mindset can make people happier, whether or not they succeed."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but things are changing in sports. Two main reasons make us question the idea of home advantage: science and money. 
Sports scientists want to understand how players can do their best. They have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who pay the players want to know why home advantage is important. They think that if players are paid enough, they should feel good playing anywhere.
What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some games far away, in places like the Far East? It would matter to British fans. They believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often think that if they cheer loudly, their team will score a goal. They remember the times when they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the times when their cheering did not help.
There is one thing that fans believe, and science seems to agree. Home fans cheer for their team and also try to influence the referee. In a study, referees watched a game with crowd noise and another group watched in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees want to avoid making the crowd angry.
Studies show that home advantage has become less important in many sports, but not by much. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England won about 70% of the points, but now they win about 60%. One reason for this change is travel. Today, players travel in comfort, and hotels are much better than before. 
Different sports have different levels of home advantage. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least home advantage. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball is about teamwork. In basketball, players feel more confident when they play at home.
Another interesting point is that players have higher testosterone levels before home games. This might be because they want to protect their home ground. In some recent rugby games, underdog teams won at home against stronger teams. They showed great determination and strength, which is part of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,C1,"""Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, 'The more I practice, the luckier I get.' This saying is popular among many athletes and their coaches. It means that when you practice a lot, you get better. Some people argue about who first said this quote, but it is clear that practice is important.
There is a big question about talent: Are people born with talent, or do they get it from practice? Many believe that practice is more important than talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said that to be an expert in something, you need to practice for 10,000 hours. This idea is in many books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers.
However, some people, like Epstein, think that 10,000 hours of practice is not always enough. He studies why some people are very good at things and why others are not. He travels to many places, like Kenya and Sweden, to find answers. For example, in Alaska, he learns that the best sled dogs have a strong desire to win, which may come from their genes.
Epstein talks about two things: hardware (nature) and software (nurture). He believes both are important for top athletes. He thinks that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in the world. Epstein also asks why we have separate competitions for men and women if practice is all that matters. Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest."""

A new report says many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her book, Kith, she explains that many children stay inside and spend too much time in front of screens, like TVs and computers. They do not play outside in nature, like in the woods or by rivers. This, she believes, is a big problem.
A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. Many children said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their childhoods fondly. They talk about how they played outside, explored, and had fun. They think this was better than how children live today. However, they forget that they are the ones who keep their children safe and do not let them play outside as much.
Griffiths writes about how parents worry about dangers outside. This worry makes them keep their children at home. Companies that sell toys and gadgets like this because they can sell more things to keep children entertained. She also talks about how some children are given medicine for being restless or how they must wear goggles to play games. 
Griffiths is very passionate about these issues. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. She says children need to have small accidents to learn how to be safe later. However, she does not explain how to let children have these small accidents safely. 
Not all children want to play outside. Some are shy or prefer to stay at home. Maybe the real problem is that we try to make all children act the same way, whether we keep them inside or push them outside. 
**Questions:**
1. What do many children in rich countries feel according to the report?
2. What does Jay Griffiths think is a big problem for children today?
3. What do many children say would make them happier?
4. How do older people remember their childhoods?
5. What does Griffiths believe children need to learn about safety?"

I am a bio-psychologist with a PhD. I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not just because of school. Many problems in life cannot be solved with formulas or answers we learn in school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play.
My recent research is about how play helps children grow. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Animals that need to learn more play more. For example, meat-eating animals play more than plant-eating animals because hunting is harder to learn. Primates, like monkeys, play more than other mammals because they need to learn more.
Children play a lot because they have much to learn. Play helps children learn important skills that they cannot learn in school. These skills include thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their feelings. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems.
Great thinkers, like Albert Einstein, keep their childlike creativity. He said school almost took away his love for math and science, but he found it again after school. He called his creative work ""combinatorial play."" He imagined chasing a sunbeam to understand his ideas.
We cannot teach creativity, but school can make it harder to be creative. School often focuses on answers that are already known instead of children’s own questions. It is also very important for children to get along with others and care about them. Children want to play with other children, and through play, they learn social skills and fairness.
Play is voluntary, which means players can stop whenever they want. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players know they must keep each other happy to keep playing. This makes play a fair activity.
School has become harder. There are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Outside of school, organized sports have taken the place of free play. Adults now plan playdates instead of letting children play freely. They often feel they must help instead of letting children solve their own problems.
These changes have happened slowly but are very big. They are caused by many social factors, like parents’ fears and the idea that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and the future, we must change this trend. We must let children play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for the future."

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect with employers. Before, people had to stand outside offices with signs that said ""hire me"" to get attention. But now, it is easier to make mistakes online.
For example, a young man in the US tried to contact a marketing executive on LinkedIn. He thought she could help him find a job because she knew many important people. However, she was upset that he asked for her contacts. She rejected his request and sent a mean message that many people saw online. People were shocked by her message, and she might regret how she wrote it. 
This situation shows that young people need to be careful when using social media for jobs. Many young people use sites like Facebook and Twitter for fun, but using them for work is different. When I was a teenager, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. You could also change how you looked online with pictures and songs.
However, using social media for work is not the same. Some young people still act like they did when they were teenagers. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you will get a job on LinkedIn. We need to understand that the rules are different for work.
Employers often say that young job seekers are too casual and seem arrogant. This makes older people think badly of us. In reality, many young people are worried about finding jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of being arrogant can hurt their chances of getting hired, even if they have the skills to do the job.
So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, say who you are and explain how you can help them. This way, they are more likely to reply. Avoid sending the same message to many people, and be polite. Remember, social media can help you make good connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid problems."
90,C1,"""It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, many newspapers in the UK have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, a study shows that only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, down from 45% in 2001. Some people believe that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. For example, a journalist in 1835 said that books and theatre would end, but theatre is still here today. Radio is still popular even with television. Movies are still enjoyed, and vinyl records are coming back too. 
Newspapers were once new, but it took a long time for them to become the main way to get news. This happened because it became easier to share news with many people. In the past, people did not expect to get news often. They only saw changes in the seasons or big events like floods or diseases. Life was very different then. 
Before the 19th century, journalism was not a job that many people had. Most people did not think they needed news every day or week. Newspapers have a set way of publishing, which can be limiting. Now, with the internet, people can read news whenever they want. They can find news that interests them and get updates quickly. 
However, many news providers focus on being the first to share news instead of helping people understand it. In the past, news was shared in busy places like markets, where truth and rumors mixed together. Today, newspapers may not be as good at explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand better."""

Humans are not comfortable in the dark like some animals. We are used to the light of the sun. This is part of who we are, even if we do not think about it. We have changed the night by adding a lot of light. This is called light pollution. Light pollution happens when lights shine in the wrong places, like up into the sky instead of down where we need it. This bright light changes the night and affects many animals, including us. 
A long time ago, people lived with very little light at night. In 1800, in London, there were not many street lights. People used candles and lanterns. The city was dark, and you could smell it before you could see it. Now, we have made the night very bright, but many animals are affected by this. 
Some birds fly towards bright lights and can get lost. They may crash into tall buildings that are lit up. Some birds sing at strange times because of the light. At first, people thought light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the stars. But all living things need darkness too. 
Darkness is important for our health. If we do not have enough darkness, our bodies do not work well. Our sleep and wake times are connected to the light and dark of the day. Changing this can make us feel unwell. 
In the end, light pollution affects us just like it affects animals. We have lost our connection to nature and the night sky. We forget how small we are in the universe when we cannot see the stars. 
**Questions:**
1. What are humans used to living in?
2. What is light pollution?
3. How did people in London get light at night in 1800?
4. What happens to some birds because of bright lights?
5. Why is darkness important for our health?"

A leader of a big company said that his company will not keep track of how much paid holiday time employees take. He got this idea from another internet company that has a similar rule. The leader said his daughter sent him a happy email about it. 
The internet company has 2,000 workers and does one job, but the big company has 50,000 workers and does many different jobs like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of taking as much time off as you want might work better in a smaller company where workers know each other well. In the big company, the leader said workers can take as much leave as they want, but they must be sure that their work is done and that their absence will not hurt the business or their careers. 
But is it easy to be sure? When you come back from a holiday, there is always more work to do. If workers feel guilty about taking time off, they might not take any leave at all. This can lead to stress and less work done over time. 
In some companies, there is pressure from coworkers about who is taking time off and for how long. This pressure can make workers feel they should work late and not take holidays. If workers do not feel safe to take their leave, they might think they look lazy. 
Also, with modern technology, it is hard to separate work time from free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because workers wanted to know how to balance work and time off. But if there are no set working hours, workers might feel they are always being watched by their boss. 
Workers have the right to take a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. I am not sure if letting workers take as much holiday as they want is a good idea or if it will really happen."

Peer review is when experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This process is important because it helps to make sure that only good research is shared. However, reviewing a paper can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Some people think this is worth it to keep the research trustworthy, while others do not.
There is a change happening in how research is published. More scientists are using preprints. A preprint is a draft of a paper that is shared online before it is reviewed. This allows other scientists to read and discuss the research quickly. Many scientists want their work to be published in well-known journals, but this can lead to problems. Sometimes, scientists may leave out important information to make their work look better. Reviewers may also focus more on whether a paper is good enough for a journal rather than if it is good research.
Some scientists are worried that preprints could lead to bad research being published. But preprints allow for open discussion, and many people can give feedback on the work. For example, Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her paper as a preprint. This way, the original authors could respond to her work, and everyone could see the discussion.
Preprint archives help scientists talk about their work with others around the world. They also allow for sharing negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals. Papers shared as preprints are read and cited more often. This shows that sharing research openly can be very effective. Preprints help scientists focus on the research itself, not just where it is published.
**Questions:**
1. What is peer review?
2. Why do some people think peer review is important?
3. What is a preprint?
4. How can preprints help scientists?
5. What did Tanya Elks do with her paper?"

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say, ""a painting in words."" But this answer does not make me happy. One day, I asked my students to pick an object and write about it. They had to write one paragraph like a scientist and another paragraph from the object’s point of view, calling it ""Poem."" One student wrote: 
**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never use me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class understand how poetry works. The exercise was funny and led to good discussions. 
When I was in school, poetry did not make sense to me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, many people care less about poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it is different from regular writing. It makes you want to read it, but often you feel let down because it is boring or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. 
What do we want from poems? A poem can show deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever thoughts. But if we want tears, we watch movies. If we want information, we read articles. Novels take us to new worlds, and music is special too. 
However, poems can be useful because they can be unclear. Life is often unclear, unlike reading a sentence. But this does not tell us what a poem really is. If you search for ""poem"" online, it says it is a type of art that uses the beauty of language. This is a fancy way to say it, but the word ""poem"" comes from Greek and means ""a thing made."" A poet is someone who makes things. 
So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Some poets say poems are like wild animals – hard to control – or like machines – made carefully. But these ideas do not always work. The best part of trying to define a poem is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, it can change how you think about both. 
Poems can be easy to remember, especially song lyrics. The mix of words and music is powerful. But can words hurt us? Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine. A poem can touch us deeply, even though it looks like regular writing. 
Why is there empty space around a poem? This space could be used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is written and rewritten like a story or article, but it is not just made to sell. Publishers send out poetry books, but they do not expect to make money from them. A poem is not just for selling; it is special on its own. Because of this, a poem can surprise us, even if just for a moment."

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money then. My wife, Marion, was very happy when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, I have found many things like brooches and coins. I enjoy feeling connected to the past. 
After the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something that impressed Marion again. One rainy February afternoon, I had some time to search. I went to a place where I knew there were old farming tools. My metal detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug down into the mud and found a round, golden ball. I was excited but tried not to get my hopes too high. 
As I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, twisted necklace. I remembered seeing something like it in the British Museum. It is called a torc, and it is a famous piece from over 2,000 years ago. I took it to my car and looked at it on the way home. 
When I got home, I called Marion and showed her the torc. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We did not try it on because we did not want to damage it. At night, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I moved it under a floorboard in my office. 
The law says I must tell the authorities about my find within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before I reported it. I even took it to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The registrar was surprised when I put the torc on his desk. They confirmed it was real, and it was sold to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. 
I received £350,000 from the sale, which I shared with the owner of the field. But the torc is more than just money. It is something I have saved for everyone. People ask me if I will stop using my metal detector now that I found something so great. But I still enjoy finding brooches and coins. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I will keep searching for more treasures."
96,B2,"""Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a little bad. When my friends tell me about their busy trips with many activities, like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew I like to take naps in the afternoon and sleep in on beautiful mornings? Sleeping better is one good thing about traveling. When I went to Mexico when I was young, I was surprised that I slept more than 12 hours most days. There were loud birds outside, but it didn’t bother me. Far from home, I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams. Without alarms and worries, I sleep better. 
I think sleep is part of traveling, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences come to us. When we sleep, we process these experiences. That is why sleep feels different when we travel. Sleep also changes from place to place. People worry about jet lag, but I think it is more about getting used to new places than time changes. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up early, feel sleepy in the middle of the day, and then are active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their sleep times. When I finally do, I feel like I belong there.
I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment by the blue sea. After eating, we all felt tired and stopped talking. One by one, my friends went to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows. I took some pillows and joined them. I had heard about the siesta, a nap in the afternoon, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.
Travel sleep is special because I remember it. In a new place, I enjoy the different smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If traveling slowly means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleeping is the slowest thing of all. Maybe I should not feel bad about my love for sleep and tell my friends that travel sleep is an important part of traveling too."""

The woman looked at herself in the mirror. “What do you think? Be honest,” she said. Mia picked up a nice hat with a soft layer and a silk bow. “I think this one looks best on you,” she said. The woman made a funny face. “But it is so boring,” she said. “Every woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This pretty hat will make me special.” She touched the small red and black top hat on her head. “Yes, this is the one I want,” she said. 
Mia smiled. She knew the woman would stand out at the wedding. Mia thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was happy to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also excited to meet Jen’s friend, Tattie. Mia’s husband, Jeff, was not sure about Tattie. “What kind of name is that?” he asked when Mia told him. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia said. “I think it’s nice.” Jeff thought it was a strange name. He did not like things that were too fancy. He also thought Mia was too polite. 
An hour later, Mia finished work and went home. It took her only forty seconds to get there. Four years ago, when Luke left home, Mia wanted to turn the old barn next to their house into a place for her business. Jeff was not sure. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. Mia knew many friends had trouble finding the right hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to try on hats in her shop in Little Pelham. She made it easy for them to find the right hat. She even let them bring their outfits to try on with the hats. Now, she also sold handbags and jewelry."

Lawrence Okoye is from London, and now he lives in Atlanta, USA. He is thinking about his journey in sports. He is confident but surprised by how far he has come. He was in the Olympic final for discus throwing, and now he might play American football. Lawrence has never played American football before, but he could be chosen for a big team in the USA.
In Atlanta, he is learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London could be picked for a big American team. But Lawrence likes to prove people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to train for discus instead. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.
Lawrence came to Atlanta to train for discus in warm weather. He wanted to prepare for the world championships. He thought about American football but only decided to try it when he got to the USA. After arriving, he read about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played before, he applied to attend the trials. 
When asked if he was nervous about being tested with experienced players, he said no. He is confident in his abilities. His performance in tests showed that he was a very good player. He felt happy to hear that he was impressive. 
Lawrence knows he has no experience in football, but he believes he has what it takes to succeed. He thinks it depends on how hard he works. He is not worried about whether he will be selected for a team. He has heard many people say he will be chosen, but he is not too concerned.
Lawrence had a tough time in the Olympic final when he came last, but he is proud that he made it to the final. He enjoyed the experience, even if the final did not go as he wanted. After the Olympics, some people thought he might not do well, but he does not want to talk about that.
NFL players can earn a lot of money, so Lawrence has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Some people think he should focus on just one sport. Lawrence understands this but wants to follow his dreams. If football does not work out, he can go back to discus, which he loves. He believes every choice he has made is a good one."
99,B2,"'I woke up on a plane flying east. It was morning, and I looked out the window. Below me, I saw brown and green land. It was September, but it was still summer in Siberia. I could not see any people. The view was beautiful with mountains, rivers, and forests. My neighbor woke up and smiled. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a Russian accent. His name was Sergei. He was a salesman from Moscow. He was going to sell safety clothes to miners. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. I used a dictionary to tell him I was going to Magadan in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to ride my bicycle back to England. 
“But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan. You cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked. “No, I will ride with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” he asked. “Yes, just one,” I said. Sergei looked worried and pointed outside. “Holodna,” he said, which means cold. I tried to show him with my hands that I had warm clothes, but I did not tell him I was on a tight budget. I bought most of my clothes at low prices. I was not sure if they would keep me warm. 
It all started in a classroom in Scotland. The room was full of tired students. The teacher was talking, and I was thinking about a question. Should I ask my friend Al to go on a trip? I took a piece of paper and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway this summer? Rob.” I tapped Al on the shoulder and gave him the note. He read it and wrote back, “OK.”

I visited Al twice during these holidays. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted to cycle around the world. He was taking on big challenges. This trip was the biggest one yet. Sometimes he thought it was too hard, but I admired him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving people wrong who said he could not do it.

In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons. The pylons are between 15 and 25 metres high. The pilots fly very fast, up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to try this flying. 
One hour before my flight, I signed two papers. The first paper said I was healthy. The second paper said I had to empty my pockets. Small things can be dangerous when flying. I learned that I had to look at the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.
Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started to fly, I was nervous. I had to keep calm and focused. If I panicked, it would be bad. 
The pilot, Dario, and I were in a fast plane called the Zivko Edge 540. The plane took off and turned sharply to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon and tensed my body. For a moment, I felt very heavy. Then we flew straight again. 
We turned left and went down fast. I felt my stomach drop. We flew close to the ground, between two pylons, at 400 km per hour. I was excited but also scared. For two minutes, I could fly the plane, but my hands were shaking. 
Dario then did a barrel roll, which is a full turn in the air. He asked if I was okay, and I said yes. He asked if I had enough, and I said no, but I was lying. Then he did a loop, flying up and over. 
Many people think this is fun, like riding a rollercoaster. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, look up.” I looked up and saw fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was easier than what the pilots do in the race. When we landed, Dario ate sandwiches, but I could not eat for hours. That night, I dreamed about flying in loops.

Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature documentary, it might be his work. He likes it very cold, around -18C. Allan studied marine biology and was a diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew find different places. After 48 hours, he realized he loved being a wildlife cameraman because it meant travel, adventure, and underwater work.
Now, he is a famous cameraman and has worked on many wildlife TV shows. When he started, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. He became known as the ""cold man."" The camera technology was very simple 35 years ago. Now, it is easier to film. Before, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Today, with digital cameras, you can see what you filmed right away. In the past, filming was expensive, so you shot less. Now, you can film a lot.
Allan has a lot of experience in cold places. He feels comfortable on sea ice. He does get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places with no leeches or mosquitoes. Wildlife filming has many successes, but also mistakes. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not tell which birds they were.
Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. It is a place with polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, it is usually -32C, and the wind is strong. Carrying cameras in deep snow is hard. After walking for five hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, he only saw one mother bear and her cub. On day 24, he felt like he was in the bear world. 
He waited and watched. After five hours, he saw a quick glimpse of a bear. The camera was ready, and he looked through the viewfinder. At first, he saw just a black nose, then a full bear. The bear came out and rested on the snow. She looked at him but did not care. Then she slid down the slope, and two cubs appeared. It was their first time seeing the world.
Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects them. He believes he can make an amazing documentary."

Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic to prepare for a new trip. This trip is even bigger. Pen and two friends will walk for three months, covering 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice to see how thick it is. No one has done this before, and the results will help scientists understand global warming and its effect on the ice. 
When he was a child, Pen was cared for by a woman who worked for a famous polar explorer. She made him tough by sending him outside in bad weather with few clothes. His father also loved adventures in the cold, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses. She helps him with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is at home because he thinks about the Arctic. 
For fun, Mary once raced against Pen in a mountain event. She and her horse finished an hour before him. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. Pen says it is harder to be away from them this time. When he left before, he told his son to take care of his mother and sister. His son took this very seriously and worried a lot. Pen thinks this was not fair to him. So, this time, he will not contact them much while he is in the Arctic. He believes that calling them will remind them how far away he is. 
Before he leaves, he is getting ready and checking his equipment carefully. He says it is hard to fix things on the ice. He will be with Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them. Pen feels more stressed being part of a team. He is also thinking about his age. He will be 47 soon and has not trained as much as he wanted. He feels worried about what he will have to do. 
Pen believes this trip is important for science. He says that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal before, but now it will help scientists. They want to share what they learn with many people. He feels that their skills are important again and can help society.'"

I liked these activities, but I wanted to compete again. I wanted to stay fit to try for the Olympics if I felt that way again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. That was good, but I remembered Ben Fogle’s invitation: “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I love rowing and how the boat moves in the water. I missed that feeling, but I was not ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not excited. I knew if I joined the race, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben help me win? No. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. This made the race real. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but we needed to work hard. I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money after being a professional athlete. It feels nice that people want to hear me speak. But I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I was doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but I was thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was hard, but it was simple. I trained almost every day, but I had a set plan, doctors, and dieticians. I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV. But my worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing. It is also about the mind. Ben had done tough challenges, but he could not row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my honesty. I could have been more patient, but I needed to tell Ben how much he needed to improve. I should have known that would be his level when I agreed to race with him.'"

A little over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. I was 26 years old and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, snowy places because I was tired of busy London. I found a small company run by Anna and Pasi in Finnish Lapland. They hired me as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, many tourists come to ride sleds pulled by huskies on the snow. The company started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is nice but basic, with no running water. They told me I could work with them for three months, but the work would be hard. I started packing my things.
**November 6, London**  
On my flight, I looked at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I was supposed to remember their names, but I felt nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window. I thought about how spring moves north, but now winter was coming south, and rivers were freezing.
**November 7, Helsinki and Hetta**  
The bus ride north was what I hoped for. We drove through dark forests with snow on the trees, stopping for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark. Anna gave me boots and sent me outside into the cold. She asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the barking sounds to the dogsheds. There were people running around, getting the huskies ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited. I tried to introduce myself, but everyone was too busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone told me to get in the sled, and I almost fell in. Then we started moving into the dark with only a headlamp for light.
**November 15, Hetta**  
I quickly learned how to be a husky guide, but first, Anna asked me if I was useful. I didn’t know how to answer. I had never driven a snowmobile or used an axe. But I did have a driving license, which made me feel better. I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet to stop, and hold the handlebar tightly. But other tasks were hard. Feeding and giving water to the dogs was difficult in the cold. Water would freeze quickly, so we made a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was tired and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I told my friends, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw. In the snow!"""
105,B2,"'On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and crossed the finish line. Many reporters came to talk about her amazing run. They said her time was good enough to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Reporters asked her about emu oil, a special oil that helps heal injuries. Olympic gold medal winner Cathy Freeman had told her to use it after Radcliffe had an accident while training. Radcliffe said she did not really understand how big her achievement was at that moment. She thought it was just what she was supposed to do that day. She and her team decided not to set any limits. Their motto was: no limits. 
During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not keep up her fast pace. Hartmann was angry about this, but he knew that people who did not know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe thought she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part quickly. She had already run 41 kilometers very fast, but she still sprinted the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster than that.’ 
The race director, Dave Bedford, said he never thought anyone would run that fast for a long time. Radcliffe thought, “I will come back and do it next year.” But sadly, that did not happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who ran in a strange way, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann worked with Radcliffe for many weeks, helping her with her training. He said, ‘I have worked with 63 Olympic medalists, and no one could take the pain like her. She would make me work hard.’ 
Hartmann traveled 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training place in France. When he arrived, her husband shouted, ‘Gerard, you are 15 minutes late, Paula is waiting.’ There was no time for greetings or tea. Radcliffe wanted to start a two-hour training session right away. Hartmann gave so much time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became upset. 
Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I trained very hard, but some people are more talented. I thought Mary Keitany would do it. Maybe people are racing against each other instead of racing against themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘It means always pushing yourself, even when you are winning. That helped me because I never thought, “I can relax now.” I always thought, “keep going as fast as you can.” Radcliffe did not know it then, but that marathon was the best run of her career. She would never run that fast again. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running.'"

When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, came out, I was nervous. I did not know if people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ in Britain. I thought we made a good show that was different, but I worried if people would enjoy cooking that included history and science. 
I watched the first show with joy and fear. I did not need to worry. The show was successful, and I started other projects, including a book about my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey into the past or into cooking. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each with its own TV show. In these, I traveled to meet special people, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes amazing. These people worked hard for their idea of perfection.
Perfection means different things to different people. Choosing which dishes to show was hard. I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. I could imagine them asking, “Where is steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?” But after a long meeting, we made a list that had something for everyone. 
I believe everyone has their own idea of perfection based on their feelings and memories. Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew the recipes were not the only way to cook. I used my skills and talked to food makers and chefs to find out what makes these dishes good. 
The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means trying new ideas and improving them. The TV show let me explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before. I was excited to learn about food and memories because I started my career in the same way. 
Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a factory that was using the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming. I even hand-milked a cow and made ice cream, cooked chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burned my house trying to make a real Neapolitan pizza."

We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the front of the van. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets. He looked like he knew what he was doing. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said after a while, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big. I could see only grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I said, because it was better to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John walk away to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I did not sound sure. “Liar,” she said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I thought about it and felt confused. “Mum…?” But she was asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea did not want to get out. The boys waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café. It was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said when it started to get dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road. She made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on the ground. “I will have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John driving. At first, Bea did not want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be pulled. I thought it might be easier to take a boat to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,B2,"'Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe named Liesel or Louisa. They were both older than Lucy by about ten years. They spoke good English and talked about the music they were playing and where they had traveled. 
“I think I’m going to Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go. She didn’t want to do many things that took her away from school. She missed a lot of school and was not officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 
Lucy didn’t even want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen pianists her age were chosen from many applicants, and she was one of them. There was a party, and her dad bought her a necklace with an L pendant to celebrate. Her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took Lucy out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The funny thing was, Lucy hadn’t applied. Her mom filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be sad if you didn’t get in,” her mom said. Lucy thought her mom didn’t want to give her a chance to say no. 
The guy from Tokyo leaned in and asked, “Tanglewood?” 
“Yeah.” 
“How old are you?” 
“Fifteen.” 
He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to brag. It was hard to know when to share and when to show off. 
“It’s just part of a new youth program,” she explained. 
“Excuse me,” Liesel/Louisa said, looking away as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed. “Have you ever been to Japan?” 
“Once. When I was about eight.” 
He was about to reply when Lucy's grandfather came over. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” 
“They're not the competition.” 
“Everyone is the competition.” 
Her grandfather took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she only understood part of what they said. 
In the elevator to their room after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” 
Lucy liked that. She liked being someone important, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn’t make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play difficult music. But here, at the festival, she felt she mattered.'"
109,B2,"""Dad said, 'It’s not good to spend too much time online. You need to go outside and see the real world.' I wanted to learn more, so I looked at what experts say. They say that many teenagers who use social media have real friends, feel good about themselves, and learn important skills for the digital world. 
Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use it all the time, not just to check emails or buy things like adults. He says it is not good or bad; it depends on how you use it. 
Jim Matthews, who studies social media, says it is like the youth clubs that parents went to when they were young. It helps teenagers share jokes and talk about their lives. It helps them learn about themselves and deal with problems with friends. 
Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that when you are a teenager, you ask, 'Who am I?' Social media can help you find out. You can share your favorite music or sports and see how others think. Research shows that teenagers who use social media are not more selfish than those who do not. He says that talking online can be easier for shy people and helps them practice social skills. 
Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social media. He thinks it helps quiet people with special interests connect with others. If you like a certain type of music and only a few people at school do too, you might feel alone. But if you find a group online, you can feel popular in a new way. 
Pauline White, an expert in digital education, says that teenagers can find new interests online and create their own content. She believes social media helps creativity. Teenagers can make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers connect, learn, and share their work. 
She says this can help them get jobs in the future. Many businesses use social media to sell things and reach customers. If you have many friends online, they can be customers for your products. 
Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they grow up and work, says Matthews. He believes that working with others to create and share content is an important skill in today’s world."""

When people think of a family vacation, they may not think of a long trip across many states in the US and Canada. But my parents wanted to have a fun family trip this summer. My dad wanted to plan a trip for us to spend time together. My twin brother and I were not very excited about it. 
In mid-June, we packed our car with bags and food. I was happy but I knew I would miss my own space for two weeks. We started our trip called ""The Family Great American Road Trip."" We left our big house and drove for a long time. 
We drove west through Oklahoma. We had some adventures, like stopping for the night in a small town and seeing many stars in the sky. We learned that cows can stop cars on the road! The next day, we woke up early and continued our trip. We saw deserts and then mountains. Each day was different, but they all felt similar. 
We visited the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. It smelled strange there, but it was a nice place. We learned that some roads are not good for regular cars. We saw many signs that said “CLOSED” at the Four Corners Monument, and we laughed about it. 
On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many windmills. At Yellowstone, we watched the sunset and saw bears near the road. Sometimes, cars had to stop to let bears cross the road. We had a close encounter with a bear, which was exciting! 
As we drove, I forgot about home. The hotel we stayed in was old and did not have internet, but the views were beautiful. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we drove back home. My parents were right; we did not need to go far to have a great time. 
It was nice to be home, and I was happy I did not fight with my brother during our long trip. We took many photos of our adventures, and I knew I would remember the fun surprises we had along the way."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and living at the college. She had a nice room with a kitchen and a study area. Amy could use the Internet and phone for free. Jeff and Dahlia would check on Amy, even if she did not like it. 
Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a few happy times with her grandmother and did not know her grandfather. Daisy wanted Rose to stay with her. Rose's parents were not happy about this, but Daisy was excited to see Rose again. Rose did not know why her parents did not like her grandma, but they had a fight in the past. Rose had not seen Daisy since she was ten years old. 
Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy liked to meet people and go to events. Rose thought this was nice. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she went to many social events. Before the move, Dahlia talked to Rose. Rose was smart and knew about healthy eating and exercise. But she wanted to be independent. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. 
Daisy understood. Dahlia gave Rose a new mobile phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They all agreed to trust each other. Rose was not a wild child. She had good friends, and her school reports were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school. This was her fourth school in five years, but she knew this would be her last school. For Rose, this was a new beginning in her life. 
**Questions:**
1. How old is Rose Frost?
2. Who is Rose going to live with?
3. Why are Rose's parents separating?
4. What is Amy doing at the college?
5. How did Rose feel about moving in with her grandmother?
6. What did Dahlia give Rose for emergencies?
7. How many schools has Rose been to in five years?"
112,B2,"'Charlotte Grainger says that her primary school teacher thought she might write a book. “I wanted to write a book because it seemed hard, and I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like sports. When I turned 13, I thought: ‘I will try this now.’ The book Charlotte started then is going to be published. “I told my old teacher about it, and she was surprised. She thought I would write a book when I was 30 or 40. I didn’t understand why I should wait to do something I could be good at.” 
It is a winter afternoon in the office of Charlotte’s publishers. I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, and I was surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a big achievement: it is exciting and well-written. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, shows that it was written by a teenager. 
Charlotte is confident and smart, but she is also calm. She knows she is young. I ask her about the important questions in her book. “I wanted to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons for my readers,” she laughs. “I think my age does not limit my understanding of the world, but I am not very wise. I just wanted to talk about taking responsibility.” 
Charlotte thinks that teenagers are often shown in a bad way in books. She says there are three types of teenagers in stories: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows nothing, and the awkward teenager who is not good in social situations. She is annoyed by these types. “What if you are okay? There are not many stories about teenagers who are not struggling in some way. Some writers make teenagers feel they do not know who they are because they are not experienced enough. This can hurt their self-belief.” 
Charlotte loves to read famous fantasy writers, but they almost stopped her from writing. “My favorite fantasy books talk about deep things in life. I asked myself: do I have to write like this to write a good book?” She does like a book called How Not to Write a Novel. “It says if the reader can guess what will happen, the story is not exciting anymore.” 
Some people think Charlotte’s parents helped her get her book published because they are journalists. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. She knows she is lucky because it is hard to get anyone to read a first book. “Every writer needs help and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. In the end, writers succeed or fail because of their talent, so I do not take anything for granted,” Charlotte says.'"

“Remember, speed is good, not bad,” said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked down the ski slope. “Now, who wants to go first?” The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew up into the air, arms moving everywhere. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. “Remember,” Gareth said kindly, “speed can be tricky.” 
I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On past ski trips, I liked to practice turns in the snow. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid to try because I didn’t know how. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and tried new tricks, landing in foam cubes – not like the real slopes outside. 
After practicing inside, students went outside to try their tricks for real. “You will get better!” the center’s slogan said. “Before places like this, new ski jumpers just went down the slopes and hoped for the best,” said Gareth. “But remember – if you land on the flat part before the jump, you will be in trouble.” The flat part is called the ‘knuckle.’ If you land in the right place, you keep moving. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important. 
At first, it was hard for me to ignore my fear and go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to slow down, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but I felt tired. “You need to control the jump, not let it control you,” said Gareth. 
On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied moves for ski-jumping, and others helped us know where our bodies were in the air. Gareth told us what to do. I needed to work on my ‘aerial awareness’ – I only knew I was about to jump and then I found myself in the foam cubes. 
We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes before I finally landed correctly. Gareth was happy for me, and I felt proud. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last jump of the day, I made myself go fast. I jumped and landed in the right place. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope, no longer on my feet."
114,B2,"'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You feel scared and hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage goes slowly up. Then, suddenly, it drops down, and your stomach feels funny. You go fast forward, turn left, and even go upside down. You scream because you are scared. But you chose to go to the amusement park, just like many other people do every year. 
Amusement parks are very popular and make a lot of money. Many people work hard to make the rides fun and safe. There are engineers and designers who create the rides. Being a rollercoaster designer sounds fun, but it is a big job. They must make the ride exciting but also safe for everyone. 
Many of the ideas for rollercoasters were made a long time ago by a designer named John Miller. He made rides that were very exciting, but they were not always safe. Now, designers have to follow rules to keep people safe. I talked to some experts about rollercoasters. They said it is important to make the ride feel thrilling but also safe. 
Designers create stories for the rides, like a space adventure or a jungle chase. They want to make the ride exciting with tall drops and twists. But they also need to use their experience and test the rides before people can try them. 
I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, would change rollercoasters. One expert said that while new technology is exciting, the real experience of the rollercoaster will always be the most important part.'"
115,B2,"'Miranda Ellington is 25 years old. She is a choreographer and has made many dance works for different theatres and dance companies. Sometimes, she still dances. I asked her why she does both things. She said, “Dancing again helps me remember what it is like to be a dancer. It can be hard to take orders from choreographers.” As a choreographer, she teaches young students. She enjoys this because they are open to new ideas. “Young dancers want to learn and try new things. They want to be successful, but they do not always know their strengths and weaknesses. They listen to my advice, even if it is tough. Sometimes they ask questions, and I like their honest feedback.” 
When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. “Sometimes I do not like a piece of music, but I still make a good dance routine for it. If the dancers do not like the music, it can be hard, but I must find a way to make it work. I wish I could try different pieces of music to make rehearsals more fun. But now, I work on big shows where the music is already chosen.” 
Miranda does not want to stay with one place. “I like to meet new people. But each theatre and school has different ways of working. I must change how I work each time I go somewhere new. This helps me not to get stuck in my ways.” 
We talked about a new documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda said, “Some documentaries look nice but are not real. This one shows the true life of a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections. I smiled because I understand how she feels. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not see how much work ballet takes.” 
I asked Miranda what makes a great dance show. She said, “It is when everything comes together – the music, costumes, lights, and dancers. We may not be perfect, but aiming high is good for the audience. Sometimes, the dance is good, but the costumes or props are not right, and that is disappointing.” 
Miranda has done many types of work. I asked if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet choreographer. She said, “People want to label you, but I do not understand why. Many people think you should only be good at one thing. I do not agree with that. For now, I want to learn and try many things.”'"

This talk gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was giving away his old sofa, and I used it in my film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and used old seatbelts to carry it. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it every night, even one night on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and cheered me on. I have walked a lot in the past years, but this was very different. It was the longest I have ever walked, and I could stop at cafés to drink coffee and relax on the sofa instead of sitting on a rock. I often told people, “No, I am not doing this for charity, and I am not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I like to tell them how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about TV shows. You can see the film on my website.'"

My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person. Many families go to the islands. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would join ten others to swim around the small islands. He smiled and showed me on the boat. 
Before we started, our group sent emails to each other, but we did not have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us a support boat would help us, and they showed us how to talk to it. We swam a short distance to split us into speed groups. Then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this swim, and I was very happy when I did it by myself. 
The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to look at the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I swam faster and enjoyed them more. I did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come back next year.'"

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help them serve food to the passengers. Some of them said yes. 
Later, when I wanted to change my job from banking, I remembered this. I went to an interview for the flight attendant job. There were many young people there, and many of them got the job too. They were also changing careers like me. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my skills and my work experience, not just that I liked to travel. Because of this, I got the job!
I think this job is great for many reasons, but free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard. There is a saying: 'No one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

At the start of the week, some children miss home. It is not the youngest children who miss home the most; it is the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now, and they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time.
Sometimes, parents call a lot to ask how their child is. This is not needed. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other things, so we tell the parents to call back later. We also get some children who come in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."""
120,B1,"'Rock the Planet is a musical show. The actors are also musicians. The show opened in London last year. Before that, it was in the USA for five years. It won the ‘Best Musical’ award four times in the USA! 
In London, it was hard to find actors. The UK has rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed more actors in London. The director found many talented actors in the UK, and they won their first ‘Best Musical’ award.
The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA. It is full every night. Many people want to hear the songs that were popular in America. I met Jamie, who is 11 years old and an actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful Gibson guitar.’ 
Jamie told me that the young actors are very busy. They have school lessons at the theatre. He said, ‘The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ I asked him if his friends liked the show. He said, ‘My whole class came! The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel confident. My parents come when they can, but it is expensive for them.’
When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found another guitar and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days. I did not know it, but Jamie helped me learn it. I was happy when I got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was trying to keep up and was glad the director was not there to hear my mistakes!
The young actors were already musicians. Some of them play many instruments, but none had played in a band before. They found it easy to play together. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is worth seeing.'"
