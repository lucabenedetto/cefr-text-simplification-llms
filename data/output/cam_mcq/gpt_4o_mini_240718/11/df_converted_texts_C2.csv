1,"Text: 'Some time ago, a website pointed out the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location – not all of whom you may want to meet. This highlighted the growing understanding that there can be negative aspects to the constant sharing that the internet encourages. The internet offers many chances to share every part of our lives with a global audience, which can seem exciting: wealth, fame, and more! So, we dive into the chaos of the internet, sharing personal stories, photos, and confessions. However, we often realize too late that the online world can be crowded and dangerous, leaving us feeling lost. This may sound discouraging, but there is hope. The future has been mapped out for us by early internet pioneers. In the beginning, they explored these online waters and identified the risks. They faced job losses, gained and lost friends, and dealt with the challenges of fame long before social media existed. These pioneers, known as the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. It is important to learn from their experiences. 

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the World Wide Web, which was mostly used by graduate students, scientists, and a few talented teens. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his life. He created a complex web of personal stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his adventurous use of this new medium. Hall's approach was simple: anyone who crossed his path could appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some may see this as attention-seeking behavior, there was also a depth and beauty to his work that many would consider art. 

However, one day, visitors to Hall’s site found his homepage replaced by a single, emotional video titled Dark Night. He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog was removed, but the issue remains. Sharing online can be wonderful, but if you think that sharing your life will make people want to be around you, you may be disappointed. 

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Sometimes, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker sent the link to her blog to all the vice presidents at her company, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers who study online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes the feeling that we can say things online that we would never say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. 

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a few months, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once a symbol of the risks of online sharing, she has become skilled at revealing just enough about herself. Armstrong has learned an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, that doesn’t mean we should.'"
2,"Text: 'Some scientists recently started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to suggest that there is much about our universe that we do not understand. How can any scientist disagree with that? Scientists can sometimes be arrogant, but even the most enthusiastic physicist would not claim to know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt it was important to warn the public about the film, calling it everything from ‘atrocious’ to ‘very dangerous’. Clearly, this film was controversial. 

At first, I did not understand the fuss. Various scientists made harmless statements about how new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It was only when the film discussed some of these discoveries that I began to see the concern – discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. I had heard before about a Japanese researcher who claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the film only provided pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to positively and ugly after being exposed to negative feelings. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is simple and easy to understand. However, scientists typically respond with skepticism. 

I understand their point. The idea that water can be influenced by thoughts is fascinating and suggests new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Beautiful pictures of crystals, while nice, are not enough. The real issue is that the film’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a mysterious energy that drives the expansion of the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research from laboratories and observatories worldwide. 

In fact, discoveries are being made that confirm the universe is stranger than we ever imagined. Astronomers have discovered that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy’. Additionally, scientists are making incredible discoveries on Earth. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay we do not notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest links between life on Earth and the fundamental design of the universe. 

Despite what some may think, science is not close to being complete. In fact, we seem further from knowing everything than ever. Many natural phenomena may never be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the world’s leading physicists are trying to create a Theory of Everything, which would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Overall, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible.'"
3,"Text: ""In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, while writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes complement each other, creating a landscape I cherish. The trees provide shade, and the wind rustles the leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the gentle change of seasons. Since I began my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a set of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and vice versa. The two types of writing may engage different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. I started my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I began writing short stories. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was challenging, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my beginning as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can take longer). It’s not the same total commitment required for the year or two it takes to write a novel. You enter a room, finish your work, and leave. For me, writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. So, writing short stories provides a necessary change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas—an idea, a word, an image, anything. Often, it feels like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can simply accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This comforts me. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I experience in writing short stories. In this way, short stories serve as a kind of experimental space for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment the way I like within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows I have placed in the world, faint traces I have left behind. I remember exactly where I created each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."""
4,"Text: 'At its core, science is closely related to philosophy, but it also has practical applications, such as curing diseases. It has improved our lives but also posed threats to our existence. Science seeks to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often falls short. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. The beauty of science is often recognized only by those who study it, while its dangers are frequently misunderstood. Its significance has been both exaggerated and underestimated, and the mistakes made by scientists are often overlooked or unfairly highlighted.

The history of science is marked by constant conflict. Established theories are often changed or completely rejected, similar to how new music styles are initially mocked before becoming accepted. The battle between old and new ideas is rarely respectful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. The history of science is fundamentally about conflict. This book will explore scientific ideas that have transformed not just science, but also many areas of human thought. While science has practical benefits, our focus will be on the ideas themselves, appreciating their beauty and being ready to question them. We must recognize both the creativity and the limitations of the human mind.

Science is inherently changeable. There is always a scientist challenging the ideas of another. Most of the time, these changes do not disrupt society. However, sometimes significant shifts can challenge our established beliefs. For example, in the seventeenth century, science introduced the idea of a mechanical universe, like a giant clock. Three hundred years later, physics began to question basic assumptions, leading us to a complex understanding where our observations can influence the universe, and we struggle to grasp the true meaning of fundamental concepts.

Some people view the instability of scientific theories as a sign that science cannot explain the universe. However, scientific changes usually enhance our ability to understand and predict natural events. The seventeenth-century scientist Isaac Newton could explain much more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein, the founder of modern physics, could explain even more than Newton. Science may falter, but it continues to progress. 

It is important to remember that at the end of the nineteenth century, many physicists believed there was little left to discover in physics. Then came breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, the discovery of the electron and the nucleus, and many new particles, along with quantum mechanics and relativity. Biology has also made significant advances. Currently, some claim that a complete theory explaining the universe's origins and workings is on the horizon. 

Science is not just a harmless intellectual activity. Over the last two centuries, we have shifted from merely observing nature to controlling it in small but growing ways. This has sometimes disrupted the natural balance in ways we do not fully understand. It is crucial for non-scientists to engage with scientific advancements, as these will shape the world their children will live in. Science has become a key part of how humanity envisions and shapes its future. The questions raised by science are not just for philosophers; the answers can impact national budgets, the health of future generations, and even the long-term survival of life on Earth.'"
5,"Text: 'Since around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had leveled off or even decreased in some cases. This raised new questions about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in “the power of the word on the page.” Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can coexist in the market, the debate about whether ebooks will replace print books continues. Whether people are trying to predict or dismiss this possibility, what matters is that the potential loss of print books continues to spark our imagination and provoke strong discussions. Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium “killing” another often follows the introduction of new technologies. Even before digital technologies, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many believed radio would disappear. However, radio survived by finding new ways to be used; people began listening in cars, on trains, and in factories. The idea of the disappearing book is not new either. As early as 1894, there were concerns that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated itself many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been thought to threaten print books as sources of culture and entertainment. Some believed the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others, imagining a perfect digital future, exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. It is no coincidence that the idea of the death of the book arises during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our mixed feelings of hope and fear about technological advancements. To understand why these reactions are so common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with different media as they become essential parts of our lives. Many studies have shown how we develop strong attachments to objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or expressing frustration at our laptops. Therefore, the arrival of new technology, like e-readers, does not just signal economic and social change; it also forces us to rethink our relationship with something that has become a vital part of our daily lives. As technology evolves, we often find ourselves missing what we once knew but no longer have. This is why entire industries emerge around retro products and older technologies. For instance, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe led people to seek out original manuscripts. The transition from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older format. The same occurred with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Unsurprisingly, e-readers have sparked a renewed appreciation for the physical qualities of “old” books, including their often distinct smell. This should reassure those who worry about the decline of print books. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be an attractive narrative about both the transformative power of technology and our resistance to change. In fact, one way we cope with change is by using familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and endings. Easy to remember and share, the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world—and ultimately, of ourselves.'"
6,"Text: 'For a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday morning. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time to do their best work. I focused on the daily lives of these individuals – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – to offer a new perspective on their personalities and careers. I wanted to create interesting, small portraits of these artists as people with routines, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I would say, “Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.” In this way, the book is somewhat superficial. It looks at the conditions of creative work, not the final product; it focuses on the process rather than the meaning. However, it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about the writer – and he was right. My main concerns in this book reflect my own struggles: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep, income, or a tidy home, or can you learn to do more in less time, to “work smarter, not harder,” as my dad always says? I do not claim to answer these questions in the following pages – some may not have clear answers, or may only be resolved through personal compromises – but I have tried to show how many brilliant and successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to illustrate how big creative ideas can be broken down into small daily actions, and how one’s habits can affect their work and vice versa. The book is called Daily Rituals, but I really focused on people’s routines. The word suggests something ordinary and thoughtless; following a routine can feel automatic. However, a good routine can help you use limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism effectively. A strong routine creates a path for your mental energy and helps manage your moods. The psychologist William James believed that putting part of your life on autopilot through good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule. Interestingly, it was a moment of procrastination that inspired this book. One Sunday afternoon, while working at a small architecture magazine, I was supposed to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself cleaning my workspace, making coffee, and wasting time. I am a “morning person,” able to concentrate well in the early hours but not very productive after lunch. That afternoon, to feel better about my tendency to procrastinate, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many entertaining stories. I thought someone should gather these anecdotes in one place, which led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day, and now this book. The blog was informal; I simply shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I have created a much larger and better-researched collection while trying to keep the variety of voices that made the original blog enjoyable. I have let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I should mention that this book would not have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I used. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also guide further reading.'"
7,"Text: 'Howard became a palaeontologist because of a rise in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, a careful man with a large mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast, and on a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was interested in the very beginnings of life, rather than the more famous periods like the Jurassic and dinosaurs. He studied small creatures found in grey rocks. As he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would get a job, especially in the kind of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving a job does not always guarantee getting one. When the Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London became available, he applied, though he did not expect much.

On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and the professor who replaced him was someone who disliked Howard’s former professor. This man managed to ensure that Howard got the job. Howard was surprised by this unexpected support and felt grateful until a colleague later explained the situation to him. He was only slightly disappointed; what mattered most was that he had the job and could do the work he loved.

Howard often compared his orderly professional life, where he could plan and pursue scientific truth, with the chaos of personal life. Many people can affect your life, and sometimes a stranger can change everything, as Howard discovered when his briefcase, containing notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station. Upset, Howard returned to the college, made a phone call to postpone the lecture, reported the theft, and then went for a coffee. There, he met a colleague who was with a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This conversation led Howard to learn about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied, which would become his biggest challenge and secure his future. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi.'"
8,"Text: 'Charles Spence is open to trying many different foods. “We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,” says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they may look like maggots, they are said to have a “slightly nutty, floral” taste. One of the challenges Spence and his team are working on is how to make eating insects more acceptable. Through his research on how our senses work together to create our experience of flavor, Spence is quietly influencing what we eat and drink. This includes the products of large food companies (he advises one well-known company and receives funding from another) and the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink in detail, a field informally called gastro physics. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and weight of plates and cutlery, and background noise all affect our taste. Spence’s book, The Perfect Meal, co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting facts for anyone who enjoys food. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? And that we eat about 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? 

Spence’s lab in Oxford is not high-tech. “It’s low-tech, just paper and drawing pins,” he says. There are soundproof booths that look like large safes, where he did much of his PhD work, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who cannot afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a large food company. He notes that in the past, research funded by industry was often seen as less serious in universities. However, since the government required universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research has become more accepted. Spence is currently helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, which is important for keeping customers healthy. Interestingly, many companies have been making these changes quietly, so customers do not notice the difference. “Research shows that when you inform people about changes, they focus on the taste and often do not like it as much,” he explains. 

Spence first met the famous experimental chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a major food company. “At that time, people thought science and food did not mix, but most food is scientific,” he says. Blumenthal’s collaboration with Spence, who studied how sound affects flavor, led to the creation of the “Sound of the Sea” dish in Blumenthal’s five-star restaurant. Interestingly, Spence points out that members of the early-twentieth-century Italian futurist art movement experimented with sounds and food, but it did not become popular. Now, the food industry is applying Spence’s sensory science to many products. For example, he has found that higher-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. “It’s surprising how shapes can affect taste, or how a tune can change how you perceive a flavor,” he says. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream melted, but they did not match the music to the taste, which is often the case, according to Spence. 

What are dinner parties like at the Spence home? One time, they had rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. “We’ve had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and ten different drinks to see if they have different pitches.” For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab.'"
9,"Text: 'Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false information, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information that we must sort through to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more than before. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us find what we needed in stores. Now, we do most things ourselves. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, with the help of our smartphones. They have become part of the 21st-century rush to fill every spare moment. However, there is a problem. Although we believe we are multitasking – doing several things at once – this is a strong and dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says that our brains are ‘not wired to multitask well.’ When people think they are multitasking, they are actually switching quickly from one task to another. Each time they switch, there is a mental cost. So, we are not juggling many tasks like experts; we are more like amateur plate spinners, hurriedly moving from one task to another, ignoring the one that is not in front of us but worried it will fall. Even though we think we are accomplishing a lot, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. It has been shown that multitasking increases the stress hormone cortisol and the fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline, which can overstimulate our brains and lead to confusion. Multitasking creates a craving, rewarding the brain for losing focus and constantly seeking new stimulation. Additionally, the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain we need to focus, can easily be distracted by new things – like shiny objects that attract infants. The irony is that the very part of the brain we need to stay on task is easily sidetracked. Just having the chance to multitask harms our cognitive performance. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while an unread email is in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. Wilson showed that the cognitive losses from multitasking are even greater than those caused by tiredness. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning new information while multitasking sends the information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do their homework while watching TV, the information from their schoolwork goes to the striatum, a part of the brain for storing new skills, instead of facts and ideas. Without the distraction of TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and categorized, making it easier to remember. Moreover, multitasking often involves decision-making: ‘Should I answer this text or ignore it? How should I respond?’ Decision-making is also hard on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. We can quickly become mentally exhausted, and after making many small decisions, we may end up making poor choices about important matters. In discussions about information overload with business leaders and scientists, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not a dislike of email itself, but rather the overwhelming amount of communication we receive. When the 10-year-old son of my neuroscience colleague was asked what his father does, he said, ‘He answers emails.’ My colleague admitted that this is quite true. We feel we must reply to our emails, but it seems impossible to do so and accomplish anything else.'"
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they cannot find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions would have seemed unimportant. Animals had behaviors, those behaviors led to measurable results, and science recorded those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral systems was considered overly sentimental. However, this view has started to change. Research on the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions, which were once a taboo subject. This shift has influenced popular science books, such as Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This change has sparked a debate that may never be resolved: do animals have consciousness? This debate leads to another important question: do animals have a moral sense that guides their behavior? 

In a recent experiment with cows that had to open a locked gate to get food, it was clear that those who opened the gate themselves showed more happiness—by jumping and kicking their legs—than those who had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we produce and consume beef? While the observations may not be disputed, their interpretation is. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" argues that the only logical response to this new research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the brink of a major ethical revolution, similar to the abolition of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, suggests we should at least reconsider our views on animal intelligence. He believes that animals likely have a simpler understanding of the mind than humans do. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should avoid attributing human emotions to animals. These three perspectives may never agree because the core issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks, what it is like to be a bat? 

Balcombe describes an important experiment he conducted that seems to show that starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Initially, both groups were fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and they quickly learned to take only from the tasty box. However, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the starlings in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, “We look back with horror on a time when there was racism. Our views about animals will one day be the same. We cannot support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.” If he were the only one with this view of animal consciousness, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He states, “What we are seeing is a swing in perspective. At the start of the 20th century, some people believed animals thought just like us, and there was a backlash against that. Now we are moving back in that direction. But this is a very controversial topic, and we should be careful of academics with strong personal opinions.”"
11,"Text: 'Critical thinking is a way of engaging with what we read or hear to gain a deeper understanding. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., notes that many believe argument is a way to discover the truth. While information technology helps us store and process large amounts of data, there are growing concerns that it is changing how we tackle complex problems and making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but appealing ideas, trends, and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Ironically, having more data does not necessarily lead to better knowledge or decision-making. West highlights that this has not significantly improved the quality of our thinking. According to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading has dropped by 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that the increased focus on visual media has a cost. She suggests that the decline in reading may be linked to a decrease in critical thinking, as people are more focused on real-time media and multitasking rather than concentrating on one task. However, there is still no clear answer on how technology impacts critical thinking. The presence of technology has complicated the situation, making it hard for academics to rely on previous beliefs. It is tempting to see computers, video games, and the internet as either good or bad, but the truth is they can be both, and different technologies can lead to different outcomes. For instance, a computer game might encourage critical thinking or hinder it. Reading online can improve analytical skills, while endlessly clicking on links may prevent deeper thinking. Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, states that technology changes how people think. She observes that reading fosters thinking and imagination in ways that visual media like video games and television do not. Reading develops imagination, reflection, critical thinking, and vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can enhance some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are real-time and do not allow for reflection or analysis. As a result, many people, especially younger individuals, may not reach their full potential. Society's view of technology greatly influences how it perceives critical thinking. The conflict is especially clear in the area of video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video and computer games are often misunderstood. He explains that they are not only a popular form of entertainment but can also be effective learning tools. Evidence suggests that video games can help develop better reasoning skills in children. Games like Sim City and Civilization go beyond simple memorization and teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging, virtual settings that mimic the real world. These games also allow players to explore ideas and concepts that might otherwise be difficult to access. In the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it is important to closely examine technology and understand how it influences thinking and analysis.'"
12,"When Matthew Crawford is not thinking and writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy institutions. His first book was a thoughtful piece about the advantages of manual trades. His latest book is a philosophical discussion on how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed advertisements appearing on the credit card machine during a brief moment while he entered his pin number. Crawford realized that these demands on our attention are becoming harder to escape. What we want to focus on at any moment is very personal, but we are often unaware of how outside influences affect our choices. It is increasingly difficult to think or remember conversations we’ve had. To avoid constant interruptions, we tend to isolate ourselves and stop doing simple things like talking to strangers. Crawford notes, “We increasingly encounter the world through representations that are often manipulative: video games, apps on your phone.” These representations reflect our desires perfectly and can take over our lives. 

Crawford is not alone in his concerns. Many people know an office worker who complains about emails all day but spends their free time checking emails. Studies show that our attention can wander if a phone is simply visible on the table – a common experience for those who have felt distracted at dinner by the phone in their pocket. There is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, but there have been worries about this since the telegraph was invented in 1837. It is clear, however, that we are more aware of other things we could be doing. While it is easy to blame technology for this crisis, Crawford believes that technology has created perfect tools for our self-obsession. Living in a world of constant choices makes it hard to control ourselves, which affects our social interactions. We often prefer to send a text message to a friend instead of risking a face-to-face conversation. By only interacting with representations of people rather than real people, Crawford argues, we may lose something essential in our society.

Screens are only part of the issue. Crawford uses his gym as an example. There used to be one music player in the middle of the room for everyone to share. People had different music tastes, which could lead to tension. Now, people usually listen to their own music through earbuds. “The gym used to be a social place, but it has lost that character. Real connections with others often happen through conflict – discussing different tastes and finding common ground,” he says. 

Crawford suggests a two-part solution. First, we need to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled practices to connect with the world in a more fulfilling way. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorcycle racers as examples of people whose jobs require them to deal with real materials. No representation can match the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under your tires at high speed. Each of these roles requires good judgment and the ability to manage interactions with others in the same space. “When you engage with the world this way, manufactured experiences are revealed as poor substitutes for real involvement,” he says. “They lose some of their power.” This does not mean everyone should become a chef; rather, it is important to find ways to use your judgment. There are many benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and makes it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, practicing attention on one thing makes it easier to pay attention to others."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. It is acceptable to say you study or teach philosophy, but claiming to be a philosopher may suggest you believe you have special knowledge or insight. This idea is misleading; philosophers are just like everyone else. 

So why do people have this stereotype of philosophers? One reason is that philosophers often judge the actions of others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical living, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers agree with this, philosophy is still associated with deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting societal norms can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to reflect on the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not require extensive reading of philosophical texts or a life focused solely on intellectual thought. It means paying closer attention to our everyday experiences to ensure they are meaningful. You do not need to be a wise person living apart from society to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is essential for a good life.

Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more disconnected from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are linked to expensive academic journals. As a result, philosophers often have little chance to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. For many, philosophy can seem distant from reality. While some philosophers have tried to change this view, many have accepted it. The academic environment has created a sense of isolation, and as philosophy has become more focused on specific debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the area of philosophy that examines human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully capture my work, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and values. There is a new trend in philosophy where ethics is seen as applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of specific social practices. The role of the ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people examine the practices and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes this examination confirms what we already know; other times, it reveals that our beliefs are difficult to justify. Either way, by exploring these ideas, we contribute to the benefit of everyone."
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies and chefs, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, throughout history, discussions about food in philosophy have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers have discussed eating, it has usually been a way to talk about something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, there are philosophical discussions that seem to be about food, but a closer look shows they are really about different, but related, ideas. 

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Despite this, his name has become closely linked to a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites, likely because these businesses hope to attract customers by associating with a famous philosopher. 

Food is also a social and cultural experience. The food we eat comes from historical backgrounds and is shared with our communities. These communities provide us with people to eat with and the systems that help grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more important ways than with any other product, making it a clear topic for philosophical discussion. 

Once food is ready, critics begin to talk and write about it. But why do these critics have such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, good food critics are simply better at describing flavors. This area has not been studied much in philosophy, as most research on perception has focused on sight, which should change. 

Another important aspect of food is its beauty. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers argue that, with the growth of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed in terms of beauty, just like art or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when we enjoy it, unlike art, which remains. Aesthetic objects need to last over time, so it is incorrect to think of food as having true aesthetic value. 

There are also many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? The answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will always question why we choose what we do; discussing these issues is important in relation to food. 

Cooking at home and in restaurants can be quite different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone is included as we gather to share food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, but only to those who are qualified, and their relationships are more like colleagues than friends. 

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we can learn to appreciate others by enjoying their food; second, we build personal connections with people from other cultures by sharing meals, a practice that has a long history in international relations. The essay is filled with great examples and entertaining stories, making this part of food philosophy engaging for everyone.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, from the United States, creates ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he enjoyed as a child were no longer fun or challenging, so he began to think about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect future games? He modified a classic game called Risk to create a new version called Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and long-standing rivalries become part of the game. Daviau explained: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’ 

He was later invited to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy received much praise, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sailing (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to keep the story coherent. To do this, they use testers to see how the games will play out. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said, ‘It takes a huge amount of time. The first few games might go well, but then after a few more, it can start to fall apart, and you have to go back and fix everything.’

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When developing the idea, Daviau thought it would appeal to a small group of people. He said, ‘I thought it was really different and pretty good, but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I expected it to be successful with just a few people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest advancements in game design in recent years. ‘It brings a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more thrilling for a board gamer than to learn a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of an unfolding adventure outweighed any worries about the game lasting. ‘At first, I was worried about making changes and ruining my board,’ he said. ‘But that concern was eased by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t go to the cinema to watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling aspect similar to video games.’ The legacy format is influenced not only by video games but also by the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau thought he would become a television writer, but he moved into advertising and then game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares the legacy design process to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start,’ he said. ‘But it’s not enough to just have a general outline.’

While Daviau feels a sense of ownership over the idea, he is curious to see how others will develop it. However, he also tries to downplay its importance. He thinks gamers will soon be asking, ‘What’s next?’ Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less certain. For him, the legacy format has been a revelation. ‘It’s an idea that changes how you think about what a board game can be.’"
16,"Text: 'Recently, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children’s movie, became popular online. Part of the enjoyment comes from seeing animals as similar to us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very intelligent and have bodies that are very different from ours. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways. 

Some people think that seeing animals as similar to humans is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually a mistake to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this mistake ""anthropodenial."" After studying many years of research on animal intelligence, he shows that animals, except for their lack of fully developed language, display many behaviors once thought to be unique to humans. These include the ability to think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand the intentions of others. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often believe.

De Waal thinks that anthropodenial is a recent idea. In medieval and early modern Europe, people believed that animals were intelligent enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed our understanding of evolution, wrote that the difference between humans and higher animals is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, behaviorism became popular, focusing on training animals through rewards and punishments. During this time, many people viewed animals as simple machines or robots with instincts. Those who believed animals had inner lives were often seen as unrealistic. This change in thinking happened at the same time that humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly.

Fortunately, de Waal believes we are starting to recognize animal intelligence again. He notes that there has been a lot of new information about animal cognition shared online in recent years. He argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits of each species. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid their nuts. 

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might focus on how many color patterns we can create on our skin. If we failed, the octopus might think we are not very smart. 

De Waal is cautious about Inky’s escape. He believes that while octopuses have escaped before, it is unlikely that Inky knew how to reach the drain leading to the ocean. However, he understands how powerful stories like Inky’s can help people appreciate animal intelligence. 

He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (a food they liked) and others received grapes (which they liked even more), the monkeys with cucumbers became upset when they saw their friends getting grapes. The study was published in a well-known scientific journal, but what really made people believe the results was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our understanding of animal minds can be quite unique.'"
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once a topic in science fiction, is now set to cause major changes in technology, similar to the impact of industrialisation. Robots have been used in car manufacturing and other industries for many years, but experts believe we are about to see a significant increase in their use across various fields. Many people see robotic automation as a disruptive force. Interestingly, while about two-thirds of people think robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years, around 80% believe their own jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not: every industry will be affected by robotic automation soon. 

For instance, the Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot called Hadrian X, which can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a task that would take two human workers a whole day or more. Two years ago, the San Francisco startup Simbe Robotics introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check that products are well-stocked, placed correctly, and priced right, rather than just cleaning the aisles. 

Supporters of robotic automation often point out that robots currently cannot maintain or program themselves, which could lead to new, skilled jobs for technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not ignore the importance of human skills in the workplace. They believe society is unprepared for the changes that will come from reducing human interaction. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, a leading expert on robotics in business, understands this issue well. As a research director at IDC, he studies how robotics is changing the workforce. 

A recent report by Zhang and his team predicts that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and more efficient, able to work with other robots and alongside humans safely. In three years, 30% or more of top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and many governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but over one-third of jobs in this area will remain unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers. Zhang stated, ‘Automation and robotics will impact lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. The best way for them to adapt is not to rely on the government to protect their jobs, but to find ways to retrain themselves. No one can expect to do the same job for life anymore.’

At the same time, advancements in motion control, sensors, and artificial intelligence will lead to new types of robots for consumers, including upright, walking robots that live in our homes and interact with us in advanced ways—robots that were once only imagined in science fiction. Zhang believes this presents a unique opportunity for companies ready to embrace this change, but it also brings challenges, such as the need for new regulations to ensure safety and privacy. With millions of jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is essential to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce that will include robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a mountaineer, is famously quoted as saying he wanted to climb Mount Everest ""because it’s there."" This response reflects a common question people have: why do climbers take on such dangerous challenges? Mallory's answer might inspire some to pursue their dreams and encourages certain individuals to confront the unknown. However, it also suggests that the main reason for climbing could simply be for adventure and enjoyment.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He identified seven different climbing activities, or ""games,"" ranging from bouldering to climbing high peaks, each with its own rules. He argued that the approach to any climb, such as the amount of equipment used, should depend on the rules of that specific game. Over the years, this perspective has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and casual conversations.

Many climbers love the sense of freedom that climbing brings. Yet, climbing can also feel restrictive. For instance, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing. However, some argue that the limited choices in climbing can simplify life, which can also feel freeing.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of our nature; we are wired to take on challenges and test our limits, even with the risks involved. Therefore, the joy of climbing may be more about our biology than logical reasoning.

US academic Brian Treanor also contributed to this discussion, suggesting that climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While he acknowledges that not all climbers show these traits, he believes they are especially important in today's risk-averse society. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits, helping people develop the qualities needed to thrive in everyday life.

Another interesting viewpoint comes from expert climbers Ebert and Robinson, who stirred some debate by claiming that climbs done independently are more challenging and deserve more recognition than those completed with large teams or artificial aids, like bottled oxygen. This claim raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Exploring climbing outside the Western perspective reveals that climbers often experience being ""in the moment"" or ""going with the flow."" The physical effort of climbing, the meditative state while climbing, and the intuitive problem-solving involved are all key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those in Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of peace. This idea adds another layer to the question of why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Text: 'For over sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel held a prominent place in classical music. He was an intellectual and sometimes serious person who explored and recorded important European piano works. He wrote and performed a lot, but taught very few students. Those who knew him well saw a playful side to him, but this was rarely shown in his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of study, travel, and performance. 

About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist: ‘You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ However, something about the 14-year-old boy caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and said, ‘He played incredibly well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a recital he had performed, and it was so beautiful that I thought, “I must make time for him.” It was a performance that connected every note. It’s rare to find a musician with this kind of understanding and subtlety.’

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to make his mark, though Brendel is cautious about the young man burning out too soon. Now 19, Kit is always busy outside of lessons—learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother keeps a close watch. He also composes music. Brendel says, ‘This is very important. Learning to read music well is helped by trying to write your own. I noticed that Kit has an incredible memory and is an excellent sight reader. More importantly, he listens to his own playing, is sensitive to sound, and understands me when I explain things. When I tell him something to do in a piece, he applies it throughout the entire piece.’

Brendel pauses and looks serious. ‘I don’t want to raise expectations. I get very upset when newspapers do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century, which is very unhelpful. It can be damaging. Like many talented young musicians, he can play some pieces wonderfully, while others need more time and practice. It would be harmful if a critic expected perfection.’

Now at 80 years old, it is heartwarming to see Brendel’s gentler side in his retirement. He explains, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous in five years, but I hoped to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I turned 50, I felt I had accomplished most of those goals, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Although I don’t have the physical strength now, my mind is always active with many pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform anymore, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.’"
20,"Text: ""When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandfather’s garden was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. Although I couldn’t reach the river, I could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. My grandfather’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors, who used old window frames and patched them with plastic where the glass was broken. 

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved, but he had a sense of humor. He liked to say phrases like, ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ instead of just saying, ‘I don’t mind.’ Deep down, he might have felt disappointed about his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it never happened. 

He was skilled at home repairs, able to build bookshelves or cupboards impressively. My parents only moved house once during their marriage, but my mother was adventurous with furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother said they were too fancy and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I later asked my mother why I wasn’t given a chance, she simply said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

Of the three places I could choose to explore – moors, woods, or the river – I always chose the river. I could imagine another world there. With a fishing net over my shoulder, I would walk along the riverbank in old sandals, looking for a good spot to take them off and leave them with my picnic. I would then carefully look for fish in the water to catch and take home. After failing to keep them alive in the backyard, I returned them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but that seemed unlikely until one day my father said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, he went against his usual judgment. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I like to think that deep down, he hoped things would turn out well if I worked hard. Maybe I’m fooling myself, but I believe that even though he didn’t like gardening, he had seen my enthusiasm for it and recognized my passion for plants and flowers."""
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I do the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic threatens to blow us off the steep cliff at our feet and into the bay 120 meters below, dropping us into the ocean. Then MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, approaches, and his blond, bearded owner gently strokes him. Despite the howling wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. He shows me around his neighborhood. Pointing to the north, he shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on Rum’s tall mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

“I have sheep to move,” MacEwen suddenly says as rain approaches. We start walking down the slopes. As we go, he shares details about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3,000 years. Herding the sheep interrupts our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to circle a flock of sheep but is not doing it well. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” means the dog should go to the right. Instead, he runs straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says with disappointment. “That will never do.” The dog looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, takes care of the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats on summer days. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry.” However, island life has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait nervously for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. But I manage, even without mobile phone service. “There is mobile reception on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days, then just put their phone away.” So I do the same.

Everything on Muck feels wonderfully surprising. The boat today brings some groceries and three musicians, who arrive with their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a great success, with the islanders tapping their feet to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay advertised in the newspaper and bought it without even visiting. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know anything about running a farm? “She had good typing skills.”

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all my food comes from the tiny island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, incredibly delicious. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to my next island. Over the past two months, many scheduled ferries had been canceled due to rough seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, secretly, I longed for."
22,"Text: 'The game design industry was once mainly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals, and it did not offer many ways to enter. Often seen as just a hobby for young people, the video games industry is now taken seriously. This may surprise some, but industry experts are not surprised. However, entering this field is not easy. Video game adaptations of new movies require many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it can be difficult to break into, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says: “It is very hard to make progress in large companies or to influence major mainstream games. But the industry needs game designers now more than ever. Not just top-level directors who manage entire games, but also those who design systems and individual elements.” 

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim disagrees. “The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed independently if you are not producing work. Game design is more than a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, it must be practiced to be real.” Another expert, John Field, offers different advice. “While ‘just doing it’ is important, it is more complex than that. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s requirements; even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit needed to contribute to this evolving field.” 

Can you succeed on your own? “Maybe, but it is quite difficult,” says John. “A good postgraduate course in games can help, providing support and guidance for a year or two. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and have a strong passion for the arts and contemporary culture. They may have spent some time working after graduation but have realized that games are their true passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety of the medium. Finally, networking is important. This is often overlooked, but to advance in games, as in many fields, you need to make connections.” 

The stereotype of a young boy playing video games has changed to a more accurate view of a mature medium that captures our attention. Families often engage with interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is much room for growth. “Games have become popular among larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this already significant area as full of new possibilities and opportunities.”'"
23,"Text: ""Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I appreciate that. I had a friend whose dad was very demanding. He often said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest in football and has not played since. I’m glad that didn’t happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was young. You can only score great goals by practicing. The best players in the world, who have natural talent, still need years of practice to succeed. Sometimes young players collide on the field, but I learned proper technique. When I teach kids, I focus on helping them enjoy learning skills. At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but football was my main focus back then. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that his habit of kicking the books around doesn’t mean he will be like me. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players could join the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He didn’t gather us and say, ‘This is your chance to prove yourselves,’ but we all understood that we had to. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a well-known TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his words. I depend a lot on my close friends and family. However, having money can sometimes create issues. For instance, people often ask me, ‘Why do you let your mother keep working?’ I have helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong people, and I think they would be upset if they felt they should rely on me. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to help those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn’t solve all my problems. After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I retire. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg while skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."""
24,"Text: 'Sam Carter was the reason we lived at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. Out of desperation, he offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father couldn’t write anything while we were there, and Sam was at risk of losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because the sun was often hidden by sea fogs. Reef Point was rarely visited by day-trippers. The road was not inviting, and the nice resort of La Carmella was just nearby, so people with sense and some money chose to stay there. Only those who were broke or really loved surfing would take the last mile to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, the place was full of people and activities. My father was busy every day trying to write a script by a deadline, and he was in a bad mood. Most days, I went out to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to join us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some cool water. My father threw a boot at him, but it was just a weak attempt to scare him off. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, ‘Who does he belong to? He thinks he belongs to us.’ My father replied, ‘You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes, he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He liked to swim too and always wanted to come with me, even though I could swim much faster. You’d think he would get tired, but he never did. That day, we had been swimming. My father had finished his script and drove to Los Angeles to deliver it, so Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. They would choose a wave and balance perfectly as they rode it to the shore. One surfer caught my attention. She was so graceful that the others looked clumsy next to her. But then she decided to finish for the day and rode in on a final wave. ‘Hi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’ ‘I don’t have a surfboard.’ ‘You could get one.’ ‘I have no money.’ ‘You’re British, right? Are you visiting?’ ‘No, I live here.’ ‘Is your father American?’ ‘No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.’ ‘Really? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’ ‘Rufus Marsh.’ ‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that book completely.’ She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that this was how it usually was. People were friendly but only showed interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning.'"
25,"Text: ""‘What have I done?’ Violet Hetherington wondered. She was in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. The line was spilling out of the area marked ‘Departures’. Her friend Annie had told her, ‘It’s best to arrive late at the docks. If you come too early, you’ll just be waiting around.’ Annie, who was married to a diplomat and loved giving advice, was an experienced traveler. But this time, her advice was wrong. After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a ‘breakdown in the computer system.’ This news made the atmosphere among the waiting passengers tense. Some tried to be patient, while others attempted to stay cheerful, but most people became frustrated. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and many felt it was their last chance for a bit of luxury. The fact that they could not board the ship smoothly did not bode well. Violet felt like leaving. She reached into her bag for her phone and realized it was missing. This was more annoying than the long wait. It made her feel that going on a cruise was a mistake. Now, she had the problem of the missing phone. She couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it there because all her contacts were stored in her phone. This was the very mistake her older son Harry always warned her about. Behind her in the line was a friendly-looking couple. ‘I’m sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make a quick call?’ Violet used the couple’s phone to call Harry and left a message asking him to ask their neighbor, Kristina, to check if the phone was left behind. If it wasn’t in her apartment, she would be in trouble since she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she didn’t tell Harry this. Harry believed that, although he was not much older than his mother, he was much more experienced. Daniel, her younger son, was more understanding of her mistakes, but that was because he made them too. Dan might forget to pass the message to Kristina. Eventually, the line started to move, and Violet was directed to a window where she handed over her travel documents and got ready to board. Her heart sank further when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a not-so-grand hotel trying too hard. There were shiny fake wood panels, fancy chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets that looked like those in airports. Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’, which were covered in mirrors and packed with tired passengers who might have preferred not to see their reflections. She was squeezed against the side of the lift as it moved up, stopping at each floor to let people out. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out into freedom. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she had decided to spend as much as she could to ensure she had a good view of the sea."""
26,"Text: 'When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, but instead, he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer known for her remarkable ability to capture striking images. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked around at everything he had collected. He realized he was on the brink of something special, all by chance. ‘When I bought this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I come from a family of flea market sellers and could have easily sold it all to someone else.’ For a while now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together details of Maier’s life. They reached out to local families who had employed her as a nanny and spoke with staff from the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be a private person with a unique personality, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘On her day off, the camera was always around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and films. Although she was not very social, she would walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be quite dedicated to her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist who followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is a pure form of art; she did not create it for commercial purposes. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. ‘What is fascinating about Vivian is the number of interesting pictures she took,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian sophisticated enough to do this on her own, or did she borrow ideas from those before her?’ Maloof often wonders if he will ever sort through all the negatives, which he has stored in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof began to take his own pictures. ‘As I improved as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I was holding something more significant than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to share her name and ensure Vivian Maier is recognized in history.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often suggests that it has not fully succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very successful, and she was at the center of a lot of attention. Despite being in her twenties, she appeared calm. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass, and the official asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s, where a series of crimes have occurred, leading a council of 12 men to come together to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. At over 800 pages, the book is “big by necessity” because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responded thoughtfully. “It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. There’s a family-like feeling at home; I received a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.” She also mentioned that it annoys her when people assume her book is not a philosophical work.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part being half the length of the one before it. This structure makes the story speed up as it progresses. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. She said she aimed to create a book with structural patterns that were not essential, but if readers cared, they could find them.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Interestingly, Catton did not plan the story in advance. “I would try to write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be in getting out of the situation I had created.” One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also discussed her love for television dramas, noting how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would be interested in screenwriting. “That could be pretty cool,” she replied, her enthusiasm evident.

She became animated when discussing her craft and New Zealand. “I notice that when I come to Britain, the landscape of my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for more populated areas to experience the energy of other people.” For now, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."
28,"Text: 'As a boy, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either building things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the past forty years, he has made a living by handcrafting steel-string acoustic guitars. “I am still fascinated by the guitar,” he says. “How can two pieces of wood create such beautiful sounds? Different types of wood can produce different sounds, and that still amazes me.” Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. “Some people would get a part-time job to save for one,” he says. “But I believed that if you wanted something, you should make it yourself. I studied guitars to understand how different shapes and woods affect sound.” The bass guitar was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making model boats and planes for a long time. “We drew designs and built them, so I was used to the process. My father taught us how to use tools like saws and chisels. I had also been customizing and repairing instruments for my friends.” Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he hadn’t thought about a career in guitar-making yet. “I was also interested in painting and sculpture,” he says. After finishing school, he decided to study architecture at university because it involved design, which he liked. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out. “I was too independent for it,” he says. “But I left with a clearer idea of what I wanted to do. I realized that building guitars is a form of sculpture – it shapes sound. I thought it might be a more practical choice than pure art because you create things that people use.” Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time to earn extra money. The first guitars he sold were priced only to cover materials, but as he gained a reputation as a skilled guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is “still just getting by.” He admits he can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the beginning, he focused on getting known. He attended music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, as he was not naturally good at that. Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. “When I started, many thought only American-made acoustic guitars were worth having,” he says. “UK-made guitars were not seen as real, even though we have always had good instrument-making courses and the skills have remained strong. Now, our handmade guitars have the reputation they deserve.” Jonny thinks valuable skills can be learned in classes, and he encourages new makers to take these courses. However, he also believes there is no substitute for learning through experience. “You should look at other instruments, see what works and what doesn’t, and try different things,” Jonny says. “If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you learn from someone else, you may only learn one method, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.”'"
29,"Text: ""When discussing English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a common tradition, and I will reference the well-known statement by the 18th-century writer Dr. Johnson, who said, 'When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather.' This statement is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many people stop here or struggle to explain why the English seem so focused on the weather. They often make a mistake by thinking that when we talk about the weather, we are genuinely interested in it. 

For instance, the American writer Bill Bryson points out that English weather is not particularly interesting. He notes that in England, we do not experience extreme weather events like tornadoes or blizzards, which are common in other places. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson, arguing that English weather is indeed interesting. He believes that the English fascination with the weather is not about strong feelings but rather about its unpredictability. He says that while we may not have tropical storms, living on the edge of an ocean means we can never be sure what the weather will be like.

From my research, I believe that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point: our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather itself. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, phrases like 'Nice day, isn’t it?' or 'Ooh, isn’t it cold?' are not genuine questions about the weather; they are simply ways to start a conversation or fill silence. 

This type of weather talk is similar to 'social grooming' seen in monkeys and apes, who groom each other to bond socially. There are specific situations where weather talk is used. Some people say that the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is not accurate. In reality, there are three main contexts for weather talk: as a greeting, as a way to start a conversation, or as a fallback topic when other conversations pause. 

This does lead to a lot of weather talk, which makes it seem like English people are obsessed with it. A conversation might begin with a weather greeting, move to more weather talk to break the ice, and then return to weather talk when there is a lull in the conversation. This is why people from other countries, and even some English commentators, think that the English are very focused on the weather."""
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip, choosing it over exciting tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they wanted to know why the Wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to help her explain life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching for 31 years, Alice began her new career as an author in 2001. Although she had a successful teaching career, she felt she was stepping into the unknown. “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very physically demanding. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not as tiring. My former teaching colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my stories,” Alice says. 

Her main goal for her novels is to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. “Much of the young adult fiction now focuses on negative experiences. It is well written,” she adds quickly, “but a lot of it is dark reality, or it’s total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.” Alice always tried to teach English and History together, such as lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy. She is motivated by her love for children. “I’m very interested in the moment when a child goes from being bored to interested, and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because that’s when the challenge begins. It’s up to me to make it work at that point.” She sees her writing as an extension of her teaching. 

Although she was inspired to write her first novel because she saw a gap in the market, the idea also came as her two sons were leaving home, and after her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. “I had been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me, but I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday on a course I didn’t think I needed.” Before she could join the course, she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, which she learned about only a few days before leaving. “I sat down at the computer and quickly created a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.” Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted right away. During the course, the other students reviewed her work as it developed, gave her great feedback, and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing ability besides that one story, she asked her school’s head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. 

Alice benefits from having her husband, critic and editor Zachary Leader, help her. His editing was crucial. Alice says, “My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I believe we complement each other. He works with what I’ve written – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, he suggests different words. My instinct is to keep adding more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.”"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to participate in a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and rugged Yorkshire Dales in northern England. 

“I’m looking forward to it,” Jonny said as they prepared to start. “I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! The views here are beautiful, and it’s very cold, so I’ll be warm in the car.” Alistair was also eager, but he was dressed in full winter cycling gear, unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt. “To be honest,” Alistair said, “I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he’ll make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway up.”

The race began at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high. This would be easy for the car, but Alistair faced a steep climb right from the start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sped away on his bike, heading straight up the hill, while Jonny got into his car and drove off. The question was, who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence quickly faced a challenge. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he encountered a large tractor blocking the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he complained to the cameraman in the car. “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair struggled with the steep slope. A few miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, passing walls and fences. Sheep watched curiously as the Olympic champion walked with his bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. With the sun shining and open land ahead, he began to pick up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another challenge. The narrow roads in this part of Yorkshire were not built for fast driving. He had to carefully navigate a very tight corner and then drive through a stream that had formed on the road. Once past the last village, he was on a straight path to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny accelerated down the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. 

With his head down and legs pumping, Alistair reached the finish line and suddenly hit the brakes. He looked up and asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they replied no, he raised his arms in celebration, shouting, “Yes!” Moments later, Jonny’s car arrived, and he stepped out. “Well done,” he said, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a calm atmosphere that protects you from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. What I struggle with most in a tennis match is to focus only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by loud applause and cheers when a point ends. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t realize there are fifteen thousand people watching me closely, or that millions are watching around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not too hard. I was just happy to have made it that far after turning twenty. Federer won easily, more easily than if I had believed in myself more. But my loss in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have played better; it was not my skill that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, my tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me, even when I win. It shows how upset I was that he told me not to cry and that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand; I thought this was my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment matters, but some moments matter more, and I had let a big one slip away in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to ease my sadness. But he was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat; this time, my mindset would be strong. The best sign that I was focused was my belief that I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to mention it, but they understood that I was already preparing for the match in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: 'In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always longed for.” Her name was Jane Goodall, and she would spend most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, the National Geographic Society in Britain helped make Jane Goodall famous by publishing articles and making documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including popular children’s books and the 1971 bestseller In the Shadow of Man, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on sentimental aspects. She has been portrayed as a little girl seeking adventure, a privileged woman wanting to live with wild animals, and a determined feminist in a male-dominated world. These portrayals can diminish her true contributions. 

Based on the number of academic references to her research, the success of her students in biology, and the extensive data from her forty-year study, Jane Goodall should be recognized as a pioneering zoologist. More simply, she opened our eyes to the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before Goodall's work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or that they used tools, like humans. We did not realize that chimpanzees share similar emotions with us or that their social structures are surprisingly similar to ours. We also learned that chimpanzee communities in Africa have unique cultural traditions. Goodall’s book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), is the most important work in this field and serves as the first encyclopedia for chimpanzee research. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals, and since chimpanzees are our closest relatives, she also changed how we view ourselves.

Even as a child, there were signs of the person Jane Goodall would become. One clear example happened in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, Jane disappeared, and her family called the police to help find her. After a frantic search, she reappeared alone, with straw in her hair and clothes. Her mother asked, “Where have you been?” Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she crawled into a henhouse, hid in the straw, and stayed still for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist.'"
34,"Text: 'In our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voices of a playful 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to viewers of children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says, “so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.” Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even well-known ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there’s more to it. You have to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions because of their fame, but often they don’t get the roles because they are too used to acting with their whole bodies.” 

After school, Shirley joined a drama course with the goal of having a standard acting career. During the course, she occasionally worked singing jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon soundtrack. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.” 

Adult female actors are often asked to provide the voices for young boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than those of male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and many forms, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices while watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of a job that includes a variety of work from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,” she says. “They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; the interaction with other actors makes a big difference.” 

The competition for work is strong, and a good showreel – a recording that shows what the artist can do – is very important. “It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached her position – near the top of her field – through determination as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.” For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also believes a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,” she says. “My children have grown up used to their mom talking in completely different voices.”'"
35,"Text: 'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many dream about as children, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and think about more practical careers, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can earn a living by drawing simple pictures, like those in the margins of school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do just that. 

People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist: I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ‘the kid who draws.’ I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to various companies. I was fortunate to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, and they bought them; soon, I was earning enough to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your mind, your hand, and something to make marks with. However, if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. While the technical skills needed to be a cartoonist are low, it is still a challenging job. No one should try to become a cartoonist unless they feel they cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have of making a living from your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I accept all kinds of work because you can learn a lot, even from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But those days are fading. For most people today, cartooning is an entrepreneurial activity, meaning you not only have to create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with this, the more successful you will be. I have seen cartoonists with average creativity and strong business skills do much better than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ circle it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it could actually be a lucky break!'"
36,"Text: 'Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. Among other items, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of even useless items, so why did I want to throw this one away? I took it to the dump and was about to leave it on a pile of trash when a young man approached me, looking confused. “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” he asked. I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said ‘Yes’. We then went our separate ways. In the days and years that followed, I felt a deep sadness for what I had done. A few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean; ten years later, he found it in a fish he was eating at a restaurant. That’s how I felt when I clicked on an email from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer and restorer named Keith Rushton. He wrote, “I’ve got your electric guitar.” It had been bought and sold many times since the young man at the dump took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back. He realized it was probably out of date but used my name to find me online. He eventually contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was overwhelmed with emotion. I would have given him anything he asked for, but his price was very fair. I had forgotten that my dad always put name-and-address stickers on my things, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this strange situation! My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it: calming and gentle, and it was easier for beginners than the violin. However, I didn’t make much progress, so I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple songs. This was also the time of punk music, when people who couldn’t play well could still be rock stars. When I took my old guitar out of the box that Keith sent me, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my smiling parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are played that way. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t have drawn a diagram for the chords I wanted to play, but my hands just remembered. My middle-aged fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or perhaps there are others my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!'"

Recently, there has been much discussion about sleep. When I wrote the book *Insomniac*, which focuses on people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and emotions. Anyone who has insomnia will tell you that sleep is essential for our mental, physical, and social health. Interestingly, those who find it hardest to sleep often understand the importance of sleep the most. It is encouraging that sleep is finally receiving the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. There hasn’t been much talk about them. We often lose our dreams. When you wake up early due to an alarm, you miss out on the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, the stage where we have the most dreams. Our most vivid and powerful dreams happen during REM sleep just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, meaning that a person who lives to be 90 years old will spend around six or seven years in this stage. When researchers prevent people from experiencing REM sleep, they find that the next night, the amount and intensity of REM sleep increases to make up for it. This suggests that dreams serve a purpose. 

When REM sleep was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the focus shifted to the physical reasons behind dreams rather than the psychological ones. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are significant. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams much better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as film is one of the most dream-like forms of human expression. However, I wondered if only creative people benefit from their dreams. Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? 

Stickgold explains that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from our past and present to create new associations. Dreams may help us discover new patterns and combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For instance, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a specific word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They tend to ""ignore the obvious"" and combine ideas in unexpected ways, which is a form of creativity. 

I personally find that I write better after experiencing intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one that I can barely remember, seems to spark my thoughts. On those days, words and images flow so quickly that I can hardly keep up with my typing. I don’t fully understand how it works, but it does seem effective. 

Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and everyone needs their brains to function well. We must think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."
38,"Text: 'Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, which has a stunning view of the sea, you see several empty frames on the walls, along with happy photos of her two daughters. As a leading artist in the copyist art movement, who can recreate the beauty of early 20th-century impressionist paintings and 16th-century Caravaggio portraits, it seems unusual that she has no paintings of her own. “I don’t keep any,” Susie says with a shrug. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” The reason is that Susie is in high demand. Over her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by many famous artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings could sell for millions at auctions, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie does not reveal most of her clients, even when asked, but they include galleries and private collectors. While many collectors truly love art, some are more interested in status. One celebrity enjoys showing off his ‘Van Gogh’ painting, which is actually a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank safe and displaying Susie’s copy instead. Susie has always been honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she aims to make it look as real as possible, believing that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. However, she signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as the real thing is illegal, and although she knows people who have profited from that, she has never been tempted. Those who create fakes often face serious consequences. Susie mentions that she isn’t wealthy and has faced challenges, but her situation is more stable now, and it wouldn’t be wise to risk her reputation with collectors and artists. Susie didn’t always work as a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden for several years, earning very little. Looking back, she sees that it helped her develop skills for her current work and sparked her love for plants, even though it was hard to make ends meet. She explains that she had to be very precise and get things right on the first try. She has no regrets about that time but is happy to have found a more financially rewarding career. When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to master her craft. Her training allows her to create everything from plant drawings to perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces and 20th-century abstract art, although she now focuses on French impressionists, particularly Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie notes that many people think modern art is simple, almost like child’s play. However, she believes that impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very careful, making their work more challenging to replicate. Given her talent, it seems strange that Susie doesn’t create her own art. Isn’t art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She explains that her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own pieces, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—acceptable, but not impressive. Perhaps it’s like living on plain food after enjoying meals prepared by a top chef. The key thing about Susie is that she is a perfectionist.'"
39,"Text: 'During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest on it. This passion started in her childhood. She had a unique bond with the boats that took her around the world; they felt like one entity. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant. People crowded around her, eager to hear about the race, but she quickly longed to be back on the ocean, challenging nature even in dangerous places. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she showed me the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher. This was her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned her supplies, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly displayed her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, a tiny gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her attention to detail was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her entire world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it. Now, she views the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, fragile thing with limited resources. 

Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. ‘It made me stop and think. It gave me space to see things differently,’ she said. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. ‘It felt like we just took what we wanted and moved on. That’s what we do.’ When I arrived at Ellen’s office, she was finishing a heated conference call. She then explained why we must act now to save the planet. ‘Coal, oil, and gas are no longer being made. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways to not use them up. At first, my message was negative – use less – but I realized there is another way to look at things.’ Now she focuses on reusing materials, passionately discussing things like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ‘I will never be an expert,’ she says. ‘But I am like a sponge. I love soaking up information. The current situation is something I cannot ignore. Compared to sailing, this feels less selfish. It’s about finding how my voice can be most helpful. It really matters.’ She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and schools to inspire young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ‘I do miss the adventure of being at sea,’ she admits. ‘It defines who I am. You feel connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message is not as simple as saying: “I’m going to be the fastest around the world.” I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I’ve ever done.’"
40,"Text: 'Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his time. He hopes to inspire other kids to explore the outdoors instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero,"" and climbing Everest is just part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to have climbed the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might complete the challenge before he turns 20.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They agreed that a young climber might be physically strong, but they were unsure if a teenager would be emotionally strong enough. They also questioned whether a young person could have enough experience to make good decisions and react properly in dangerous situations.

The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can’t focus on it – there’s still so much to do. I think about possible problems, of course. Karen and I consider the risks all the time, but we believe our experience as climbers will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He’s becoming very strong and mature.""

I also wonder about Jordan’s reasons for wanting to climb. Is this just an ambitious father pushing his son too far? Paul insists, ""This project isn’t about me trying to gain fame through my son’s achievements. At first, Jordan thought about doing it later in life, but we discussed it and decided: ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him often to ensure he still wants to do it.""

When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ""I just focus on achieving my goal."" In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting event. The more exciting the record, the more interest it creates. This puts Jordan in a difficult position. We often say that achieving goals can take away from the enjoyment of the experience, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he must engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to offer something impressive, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he’s done with mountain climbing and wants to play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym."""

42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you regret I came here,” she said to the school, with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie wouldn’t have minded if she had. Her mother understood how Bonnie felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it was quite confusing at first. Then she saw the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved between the trees. “I wish you’d walk next to me instead of behind me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t seem to expect Bonnie to do so. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be kicked out soon anyway, so why not get it over with?” She left the building and went towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one in sight. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, carefully observing each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. The next horse caught her attention. “But aren’t you the best of them all!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. It can’t be far.” Bonnie was happy to find that the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. Lost in the joy of putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she climbed onto the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in control of everything she could see. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I’m serious, I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else.” She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, with a light breeze brushing past her cheek. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"Text: 'I have met Cody Simpson before and have always admired his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up performing on stage in front of thousands of fans? “I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven,” Cody recalls, explaining how it all began. “But I was swimming and surfing every day. Those activities were more important to me back then; I had my life set up and was busy. When I was 13 and in high school, I posted a few videos online.” These videos changed everything. He started by sharing a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos. So, Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share. The responses were overwhelming. Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with top coaches and focused on perfecting his sport. But then record labels contacted him, and he faced a tough choice: stay in Australia and continue swimming or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the plunge. “It was very difficult for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. “It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,” he remembers, thinking of their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy industry.” So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family across the world, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody believes it’s important to have a close circle of good people around you to stay grounded. Of course, everyone has days of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight, and he’s traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how that affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support and encourage me in everything I do.” Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big break, even when it’s a bit scary. “It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m visiting countries I never thought I would see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s something many people dream of achieving. But I know it won’t last forever.”'"
44,"Text: 'I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sunlight. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the wall of sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I had worked with most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing that I could handle the job. My grandfather didn’t seem to notice. With one hand still on the curtain, I looked along the half-mile stretch of steaming black water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on either side, and the dark open water was followed by solid ice downstream. As I took off my pajamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. I didn’t recognize him. I frowned. Amazingly, he was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from an expedition in South America. This chain is much better than having a famous grandfather, and only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have the actual diary he kept on that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled at me as I took a banana from the counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he stepped out of his bedroom. ‘Can’t you watch where you’re going?’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ As if my wetsuit didn’t make that clear. As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s been harder lately. ‘What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. For a moment, his harsh words hit me hard. But I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. Mom came in with a sympathetic smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished for her. I held back from saying he had always been that way. But, like Mom, I try to be kind to him. When I was a child, he was my hero – from the time he first showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang framed on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. Yet, a part of me still wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even on these cold days!’ I smiled back at her as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse.'"
45,"Text: 'Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her into the study, where on the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously unfinished. “Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” Jess looked closely at the painting. There was a river that took up most of the scene; it was not a river she recognized and might not even be real, just a made-up river. The painting was strange and unclear – yet beautiful in a haunting way. The riverbank was almost unnoticeable, with just a hint of green that the eye barely registered, as it was drawn into the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people; and it felt right that way. There seemed to be no place for living things in this distant image. Yet for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking about autumn coming after a long, warm summer. Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice – too casual and detached – that showed her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others interpret them, if they could. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written there. Jess read them aloud. “River Boy.” The words felt strangely significant to her, but she couldn’t explain why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” “Exactly. Strange, isn’t it – for him to be so specific. Still, he hasn’t finished it yet, so maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” “Mum! You should have known better.” “I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. I guess you can imagine his response.” Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. “He told you it’s not the artist’s job to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, just like a poem, and we either understand it or we don’t. And he said painting is hard enough work without having to waste time explaining it to every fool…” “Ignoramus, he said.” “...every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their paintings to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who came along, they’d never get any work done. And he said…” Mum interrupted her, laughing. “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to inspire him.” “Inspire?” “Someone who motivates an artist.” She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually, it was just to say that the muse wasn’t being kind to him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a tough part to work on. He never suggested the muse was about her. In fact, she always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. “He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He’s been painting all his life.”'"
46,"Text: 'When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. That is something that could have happened. I’m not saying it did, just that it could have. I didn’t mean to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up thinking, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it’s too late. This happens to me quite often. I’m a bit unlucky in that way. 

What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in there: shepherdesses, milkmaids, and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was so happy when she gave it to me! 

But the cabinet is a corner cabinet, which means it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, tucked under the roof, and shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one that is the size of a broom cupboard is mine. Mum says that when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. And when Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems I will be stuck in my broom cupboard for a long time. 

I don’t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the way the roof slopes down and the window is at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimeters off the bottom of it... That was when I had an idea. If I couldn’t cut anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"Text: 'The novel ‘The Borrowers’ tells the story of a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house, borrowing things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it would be challenging to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how it should be portrayed. I relied on the original illustrations from the book because I wanted to avoid criticism for getting it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' point of view, not that of humans, which made filming more complicated. 

The most important aspect was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on borrowing missions, we had to position the camera ten times further away than usual. To capture the Borrowers' perspective, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. 

A major challenge was creating realistic shadows when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized surroundings. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, the famous US director George Lucas called to ask how we achieved it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with oversized objects to make the actors appear small. It was wonderfully surreal. I remember asking them to carry giant scissors, and they really embraced the idea. The coins were particularly memorable; they were larger than dinner plates and hard to lift, often making the crew laugh so much that we had to pause filming. 

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to be pushed down a tunnel with hoses, and they found it so frightening that they didn’t need to act. One important aspect for me, which other directors have struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they would stick out like dolls' clothes. This made it very difficult for the lead actress to move; she couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail with the costumes!

Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren’t physically there. I had to draw pictures of each scene to show how they should look – I ended up with 2,000 drawings. They weren’t precise, but they were helpful. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once filmed an entire scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But everything came together in the end, and I believe the series successfully captured the magic of the books.'"
48,"Text: ""Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, searching for journalists that aren’t there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones asking for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. ‘Everything will be fine,’ I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life on the road with tour tutors. While the rest of the band is renting here for recording, we are staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet regular kids. How about a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns? That would be so cool. 

I walk into the school’s main office. ‘Hi, I need my schedule, please,’ I say to the school secretary. ‘Name?’ She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ‘Desert McGraw.’ ‘Desirée?’ she asks, leaning closer. ‘Desert,’ I repeat. The secretary seems confused. ‘Oh,’ she says and types ‘McGraw’ on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad uses his stage name. ‘What grade?’ ‘Eleventh.’ ‘One moment, it’s printing,’ the secretary says. Then she rips the sheet and hands it to me. English Literature, first period. Great, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map the night before so I wouldn’t look foolish searching for my classes. 

When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. ‘Aurelio Gonzalez.’ ‘Here.’ She continues while I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes scan my very normal and, I must say, clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! ‘Nice shoes,’ she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. ‘Thanks,’ I say. The teacher pauses in the attendance. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize! All teachers should understand how important this is. 

‘So why did you move here?’ my new friend asks. I have many options. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras, reporters, and the red carpet? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ‘We need a change, Desert,’ he said, ‘and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.’ Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a recording studio two steps from the sand? ‘My dad had to move,’ I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ‘What does he do?’ she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. ‘He’s an artist,’ I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. ‘Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.’ And she doesn’t seem to care. Great."""

Today, American teenage girls are expected to be Student Council presidents, have part-time jobs, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Both boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average; mediocrity is not acceptable, and lacking ambition is seen as laziness. Teenager Kristen Loose explains, “People, often adults, forget how much pressure teenagers face today. We have a lot of homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to maintain a social life.” 

Despite these pressures being common, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, many believe it is unfair to label the entire generation this way. Loose points out that many people think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She acknowledges that she often has her cellphone nearby, but she uses it for more than just texting friends. It is a tool that helps teenagers manage their lives. 

Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and be reachable at all times, which can create the impression of cellphone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities now require attention around the clock, adding to the stress of already busy teenagers. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish after midnight, balancing school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. 

The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of American teenagers get the recommended amount of sleep. Additionally, 28 percent of teens admitted to falling asleep in school about once a week due to lack of sleep. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen believes that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen rarely spends this time on social media or TV; instead, she dedicates it to volunteer work. She says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests.” However, Olsen enjoys volunteering and looks forward to making a positive impact in her school and community. 

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these views and make a difference in the world. There will always be a new generation of students who are making their mark before they even finish school."
50,"Text: 'The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded mostly by wilderness, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this small group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This ongoing science project is both an astronomy experiment and an outdoor adventure, which may be why teenagers join. I visited them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to capture images of shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a bright trail of light. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside were a camera, an altitude measuring device, and a thermometer to check temperature changes during the ascent. Two GPS trackers were placed on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. A gas tank, given by a supporter from a nearby state, was used to inflate the balloon, which slowly grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour round trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it was time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they counted down, and the balloon began to rise. Some of them ran and followed its path with bright flashlights for as long as they could, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was silence and a strong feeling of wonder. Then the balloon vanished into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at a sky so clear that it was hard to believe they were only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with around 4 million people. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor streaked across the sky. As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, causing the balloon to expand until it was almost the size of a house. Then it popped with a loud bang. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Retrieving it wasn’t easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, noting they’ve lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey has been getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to reach it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They also had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. ‘It’s important to remember that these students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What may seem wild and dangerous to some is just a way of life for others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera hadn’t captured any shooting stars. While this was a bit disappointing, it also provided a chance to discuss the effects of atmospheric waves and how they might behave above mountain ridges. And it was one more adventure story to share with anyone who asked.'"
51,"Text: Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, did not interest her much until she was fifteen. It was more of an accident than a plan. ""My younger brother was going through a dinosaur phase, which I had not experienced. I usually dismissed it. I helped him with a science project, and when I found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology, it amazed me. I knew right away that I wanted to pursue this field.""

I am curious about the support she received, as Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people back then. ""I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,"" she laughs. ""Matt Cornelius was already famous, even though he was young. I was very nervous, even though he was known for being friendly. I worried he would think I was just an annoying kid asking too many questions. It could have been awkward,"" Chloe says. ""But I felt more comfortable when he showed patience and listened to me.""

I ask her about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowns for a moment. ""I have to admit that films like Jurassic Park, which feature dinosaurs created with special effects, have increased public interest in these creatures, but not necessarily in Palaeontology itself. While I appreciate this interest, I think the few palaeontologists shown in films are often portrayed inaccurately. It bothers me that we are either seen as eccentric geniuses or as socially awkward people who cannot connect with others. Movies do not accurately represent our daily work life.""

I ask her to explain her job. ""My work is very varied. I spend a lot of time digging up dinosaur bones, but I also work long hours in laboratories, analyzing fossils and writing for scientific journals."" Although it is not something she does every day, she also communicates scientific findings to the public when she can. She takes this role seriously. ""There are many misunderstandings about science, and while some colleagues do not want to be distracted from research, I believe it is important to address these issues. I want to reach out to young people because it is essential to inform them about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs can inspire children to learn about the natural world and explore other areas of science.""

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She emphasizes that the creators of the program knew what they were doing, and she was there to offer advice if needed. ""I had an easy time because there was little I needed to correct, like dinosaurs that were too large or the wrong shape; mostly, I checked that the dinosaurs shown lived during the same time period. We attracted audiences of all ages because we have learned so much about dinosaurs recently, and the ones in this program are very different from those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are the most realistic representations ever made.""

Why does Chloe think dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain a focus of research? ""I believe they appeal to our natural curiosity. Our imaginations are drawn to the unknown and the idea of discovery. In a world that seems to be getting smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still much to explore. Palaeontology is like a form of time travel."""
52,"Text: ""I will say this once: when you are traveling by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not ‘there yet,’ even when you keep asking, ‘Are we there yet?’ The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not ‘there’ anymore; it’s ‘here.’ So if you think you might be ‘there’ already, you should be asking, ‘Are we here yet?’ I’m sure no one wishes to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear that question over and over on long car trips. 

Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You could watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the beautiful views outside. In the front seat, there’s a parent with a map, giving out juice boxes and cookies, adjusting the radio, and making sure everything runs smoothly. 

But then, someone in the car does something annoying—usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he’s all over my space, and a fight starts. The driver and the other parent have to reach back to separate us while the car swerves. They tell Tim to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a bit, and we continue to see the beautiful scenery.

Then, while I’m trying to read, I feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing his breath in my direction. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. This makes me angry. Tim gets yelled at again, and the car swerves more. Eventually, things calm down again.

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask, ‘Are we there yet?’ he often replies, ‘Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.’ But we are still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour. Then he says, ‘Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.’ This keeps us quiet for a while. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults jump out of the car and move as far away from us as possible after all those hours. So remember: if Mom and Dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you’re not there yet."""
53,"Text: 'John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee and cake while playing board games. The owners hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation for starting this business: “There is so much technology today. Everyone is busy with their mobile phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn’t involve staring at screens. It’s natural for people to connect and communicate.” The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged until the end, so no one feels left out. This idea was improved in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players either win or lose together, encouraging more social interaction. Pandemic, a Eurogame where players work together to solve global problems, was created by North American designer Matt Leacock, who is very successful in the board game world. He was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, based on the famous book. Leacock recalls, “When I played that with friends, we felt scared and excited. In the end, everyone felt good, whether they won or lost. I wanted to create something like that.” Leacock’s love for board games started when he was a child. “Games were my favorite birthday gift,” he says, “but I would get very excited, open the box, and then feel disappointed when we played.” With help from his game-loving uncle, young Leacock would change the games they played to try to make them better. Pandemic became a huge success, and its follow-up version advanced game design even further. Leacock explains, “It has a lot of storytelling. It’s like a video game where you develop characters, get new rules, and the world changes. It tells a story.” Surprisingly, the growth of the video game industry has helped the success of modern board games. Many people now have game consoles and play mobile games, making game-playing more common. Ben Hogg, who works for a leading games company, says, “Video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. Everyone plays games on their smartphones now. More people are open to playing games than ever before.” For a while, video games allowed some social interaction, like at arcades or multiplayer games played in the same room. But then, many multiplayer games moved online, making players physically distant from each other. As a result, some people who enjoyed video games began to seek ways to play games with others in person again. In John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just entertainment. In our increasingly online world, games are now something to be shared directly and physically, and this trend is likely to continue.'"
54,"Text: Jamie Scott has written and produced many popular songs in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are important in the music industry, even if your career starts with many challenges. He mentions that his mother was a great singer and helped him learn the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced his musical taste as he grew up. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he did at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room learning songs on the piano. He said, “I was doing well in tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for my life. It was just too much hard work.” At 17, he left school to pursue a career as a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not share his passion for performing. Jamie recalls, “I went to my parents and broke down. I told them I wanted to do this, that I had been writing lyrics in economics class and playing the piano every day while others were outside.” His father gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would need to find a job. After several close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 based on one song. However, record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend. Ultimately, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. However, fame did not come easily. He said, “In my own artist career, I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time. But as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.” Writing for other artists is where he truly found his success. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists. He helps launch their careers. Sometimes, he has to explain to the artists he works with that aiming for chart success is not something to be ashamed of. He asks, “Why don’t you want to? Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?” He emphasizes that they should create something amazing that is also likely to sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write hit songs. Scott does not come across as arrogant; he simply understands that he wants to write number one songs and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goals. He says, “When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.”"

He is a ‘street trials cyclist’ – he jumps from difficult places like roofs or walls to land safely in other challenging spots. These stunts are filmed and shared online. On the day I interview him, we meet in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids know who he is, and several older people come to greet him, calling him ‘an absolute legend’. After seeing some of his skills, I agree with them. I came with doubts, but I am impressed by his courage, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and I sometimes doubt he can succeed. However, when I compliment him afterwards, he seems uninterested and a bit down. Despite his online fame, Tony says he is not comfortable with being a celebrity. ‘I find the social side hard. I understand the importance of connecting with fans, but I prefer to focus on doing things rather than talking about them.’ This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that create much of that content. ‘This technology allows people like me to earn a living,’ he says. ‘Sometimes I feel like everyone is filming themselves or looking at screens, and I don’t fully agree with that.’ Still, he is not complaining. Through his videos, he makes a good living from what would have been just a hobby in the past. After many years of interviewing top athletes, I’ve learned that two key factors turn a passionate child into a top competitor: energy and the ability to overcome emotional disappointment. These traits may be more important than talent and help build the mindset to keep going despite failure. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength is needed. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he considered easy but new challenges. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He says, ‘Those who criticize me may care, but they don’t understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t see the technical side of what I do and don’t realize I get advice from experts to reduce risks.’ In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. ‘People are different. Some never feel scared, and they probably shouldn’t do these sports; it’s smart to recognize the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those who can’t overcome fear and those who can. I belong to the group that feels fear but finds a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend hours planning and preparing. Sometimes I need to ride around for a while to get in the right mindset before trying a new stunt. I know I must stay calm just before I jump. If I fully commit, then I’m fine.’"

For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net; she only had a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. ‘The training was a shock,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could keep going. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterwards. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ However, this experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"

He had previously written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.” Jeff wanted a unique touring bike and decided to build one himself. He thought a penny farthing would be the most interesting choice, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, which ended because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more people were amazed by it. His worst experience was having to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine and had no money for a hospital or to return home. Despite these challenges, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"

We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we know very little about their nighttime activities because we did not have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat. 

The work is challenging. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and record every duck I see. The weather has been difficult; some nights are warm, but most are rainy. It is very quiet, and I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles.

60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a center that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching objects like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

In the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing repeatedly – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great aspect is the friendships with other performers and the chance to learn from them. Staying fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is essential, but the best performers are those who desire success, have creativity, and never stop improving their skills. 

People often think that injuries are common, or that you might only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also includes business planning. Many former students have started businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, though, that it’s not a profession for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also competitive – but a lot of fun!”'"

“What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. It might even be a funny little song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never complain; I just do my job!”

“Excellent musical skills are very important for my work, as well as the ability to learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. I will never forget my first experience recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are already long enough.”

“One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers do not always know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.”'"

These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular among many celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, from cake decorating to party planning, instead of just going with her first thought. Once she made her choice, not everyone supported her. Julie recalls, ‘Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.’ She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. Although Julie was not familiar with fashion blogs, they played a key role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her products continued to grow, along with the speed at which her company produced the satchels. Julie now enjoys waiting to see which celebrity is seen with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online ads, she uses the internet community for ideas on new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied Julie’s design to sell similar bags, so she now ensures she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices – people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while the buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place.'"

She was a good swimmer, and her coach believed she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard for her to balance training with her schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and began competing. Vicky found this exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so attending training sessions after school was easy for her. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. When she turned 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky explained, ‘For years, I loved winning, but I started to feel tired of it all – when the excitement fades, it loses its meaning. Fortunately, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sports,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to learn to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does important work and helps young people feel part of a community.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘I know some people question whether celebrity support is always good for a charity. They argue that celebrities may be more interested in their own image, which can distract from the charity's real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I believe they should.’"

Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school, and she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. This teacher suggested that she join the school theatre club to build her confidence. After some time in the club, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional. Although she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, which inspired her to write the song Something to Say. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in her words. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to invite her to join the company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone to control her music. However, Joss assured her that this would not happen, and soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a wonderful evening. Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times rather than happy moments, as she feels she has more to express then. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about her brother's temporary stop in singing and how it affected him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her music, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her.'"
65,"Text: 'Last year, I went on an incredible trip – a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, although I do not share that interest. However, I had always dreamed of visiting this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally agreed! A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. Luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry promised he would handle everything, so I stopped worrying. 

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people live along that coast, and indeed, the only other living creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was wonderful to forget about how fast or slow the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all cooked together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life! When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I return to normal life? But I knew if I stayed, I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!'"
66,"Text: ""My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. I watched many of his games when I was a child. You might think that seeing so many matches would make me love the sport, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training session, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed, and a few weeks later, I found myself playing against another school’s team. My parents watching made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t a big change for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too! I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""
67,"Text: ""Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I trained to be a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and was surprised by how much I enjoyed giving tours. I saw the city I had lived in my whole life from the perspective of tourists, and it felt like a new experience each time! After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I researched what I needed to do, I learned that to get a license as a full-time tour guide, I had to know much more than I had learned so far. All Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. 

Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. There are many other important skills. You need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and most importantly, you must be able to adapt to changing situations. For example, if a place you thought was open is actually closed when you arrive, or if the route changes. Tourists do not want to hear about problems or that they are missing something; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour. I must ensure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I understand that these reviews are very important because good reviews attract more customers. That is why making tours enjoyable and stress-free is essential. For me, the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job mean that my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."""
68,"Text: 'My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were all older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first time doing something like this. However, we ended up having a great experience. 

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of our day. Josie found it very hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meals made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very enjoyable, even though I got wetter than the elephants! 

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a small bedroom because she didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which we both do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. 

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I think she might be a little upset with herself for not fully enjoying her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she reflects on the experience, she realizes how lucky she was to go. Maybe she will return one day – I definitely will!'"
69,"Text: ""My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just for personal gifts or home decoration; we have many types of customers. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and we sometimes provide flowers for businesses' advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle for a wedding, which was a lot of work, but I felt very proud of what we accomplished. 

My day begins at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be quite cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were picking for myself, I would probably choose only pink flowers, as that is my favorite color. However, I have to remember that my preferences may not match what customers want. 

Sometimes, it’s difficult to find the flowers customers want because not all flowers are available all year round. I don’t enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it is part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price I can. 

Back at the shop, we review customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought into vases. Then, we create flower bunches and calculate the costs of the orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much work, but I enjoy figuring out how to create beautiful arrangements within a budget. That’s what selling is about, and I wouldn’t want to do anything else!"""
70,"Text: ""My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and many children's movies on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized I wanted something more – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which created a great atmosphere for the film, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs without making a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can track ticket sales online, so we no longer worry about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us how much they enjoyed the experience, it feels wonderful. Our website has been very helpful, and we are now connected with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to see how they operate, but it is always nice to return to our own club! We also started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local reviews. We have tried putting up posters in cafés, but nothing is as effective as word of mouth – people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film; last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""
71,"Text: ""Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, so I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to share these photos on a website for young photographers because I wanted to create a photo diary and show others my work. I was surprised to find that many people liked my perspective and style. I enjoyed photographing a variety of subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better, and I agreed. I started focusing more on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what most young photographers were doing, as they were taking color photos. Because of this, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up. In the end, I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for my age group, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and that I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my career choice."""
72,"Text: 'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities that help you grow and learn. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you finish each level, you receive a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take on the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I found myself wanting to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I completed the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had formed good relationships with the children. Now, I spend about four hours a week there, and I always look forward to it. 

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I have decided that after I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job or youth work before starting at the club. This experience has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, including one for camping!'"
73,"Text: 'I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved the sport and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I did well. Soon, I developed a passion for snowboarding and improved my skills. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for participating and winning has grown as I’ve aged, which motivates me to work harder. I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I would try the jumps that earned me that score until I actually started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. In the summer, I focus on training and studying when there’s no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends during this time. It helps me cope with not being able to do what I love and what I’m good at. I need to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also believe it’s important to have another option in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is possible if my active life allows time for college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever.'"

One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am grateful to my parents for making me do that – it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try that. I never thought it would be so easy, as it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. Mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to be sure they looked good enough for others to buy. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my items to take home. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but we were just two people at a market stall! That was when I realized it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far.'"
75,"Text: 'When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly inspired by Janine’s own life. In an interview about her book, Janine said, “Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve learned to make new friends easily. I know what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, adjusts to a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.” 

Janine started her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to spend her time this way. The year before, she entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was available in bookstores. 

One review of Being Amelia notes that, despite the book having pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the characters face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer mentions that even though Janine is still very young and Being Amelia isn’t a long novel, she has shown that she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors. Janine is still adjusting to being a famous writer: “At first, I would hide when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s fine. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I know that if I spend time with my friends, I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!”'"
76,"Text: ""My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy about this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should accept the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school nearby. However, once we moved, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment there is comfortable. In summer, the island is lively with many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, but there are not many teenagers among them, which I had hoped for. The adults help each other and work together on repairs around the island, which can be hard work. 

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I will miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So, when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! But we often enjoy amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then, within hours, it can be bright and sunny again. This still feels incredible, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do experience terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to withstand them. But then I remind myself that it has been here for centuries and is still standing!"""
77,"Text: 'I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best spots to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am close to achieving that. During family holidays abroad, I have had the chance to see birds from other countries as well. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I have learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it interesting and commented positively. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous just before I walked onto the stage, but I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me. I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not consider becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in areas with lots of green spaces. I also believe that birdwatching clubs should work to attract more young people to this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to be expensive.'"

My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought I would do the same with football. But that never happened. I even started dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised at first because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club when I was just 13. After that, I improved a lot. Still, some people doubted I would ever be a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let the other players down. By chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with the large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to meet other players from my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and encourage them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach’s advice to me – there will be good times, but also some bad times. I’ve had very few bad times, though – so I’ve been lucky!"""
79,"Text: 'In recent years, there has been an interesting trend in further and higher education in the UK and around the world. This trend encourages new students to get involved in research as early as possible in their studies. This idea shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries, but is also a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will be helpful not only in your studies but also in your future jobs, as they help you think about the world and how to approach your work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions instead of accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we encounter? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes and new knowledge. However, research can also start from simple inquiries that involve careful work, thoughtful questions about issues, and practical suggestions.

Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done some research for school projects or answered questions at work since you started. You have asked questions that led you to investigate topics, whether it was about where to go on holiday, how to grow plants, fix things at home, train your dog, find the right music system, or shop online.

In college and higher education, it is expected that you will have a curious mind, identify problems and questions, critically explore and evaluate information, and create your own responses and knowledge to contribute to discussions. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning comes from listening to teachers and texts. It may feel disrespectful to question established knowledge and authority, and you might think you should be told what is important to learn.

However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students, academics, and professionals, but we must not just repeat what we read as if it is true. We need to engage with it, think critically, test it, and determine if the information is logical and supported by evidence. We should avoid blindly accepting facts and information from our readings or conversations.'"
80,"Text: 'Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity, from the coffee houses of 18th-century London, where people discussed science and politics, to the cafés of modern Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso talked about art. However, living in a city is not easy. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera; Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While modern cities can be creative places, they can also feel unnatural and overwhelming. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. It has long been known that city life is tiring, but new research shows that living in cities can actually reduce our ability to think clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for our brains. Studies have shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains because they provide a break from the busy city life. This research comes at a time when more people than ever live in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into concrete environments, surrounded by many strangers. Recent studies show that these unnatural surroundings can significantly affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Think about everything your brain has to manage when walking down a busy street: distracted people, dangerous crossings that require attention to traffic, and the confusing layout of the city. These small mental tasks can leave us feeling exhausted because they take a lot of mental energy. Cities are filled with so many distractions that we constantly have to shift our focus. This process of deciding what to pay attention to and what to ignore uses a lot of our brain's energy. In contrast, natural environments do not require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. It has been known for a long time that our ability to focus is limited – if we concentrate hard in the morning, it becomes harder to focus in the afternoon. Kaplan suggested that being in nature could help restore our attention. Natural settings have many things that naturally attract our attention but do not cause negative feelings, unlike loud noises like police sirens. In nature, our mental focus can relax and recharge. Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban areas. Urban parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a break from city life. A well-designed park can enhance brain function in just a few minutes. While people have looked for various ways to boost brain performance, from energy drinks to office redesigns, it seems that simply taking a walk in nature is one of the most effective methods. Given the many mental challenges caused by city life, one might wonder: Why do cities keep growing? And why do they remain important centers of intellectual activity, even in the digital age? Recent research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that can lead to problems with attention and memory – like crowded streets and close proximity to others – are also linked to innovation. Scientists believe that the ‘concentration of social interactions’ is a key factor in urban creativity. Just as the crowded environment of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy atmosphere of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, supports its role as a hub of technology and creativity. Conversely, less crowded urban areas may produce less innovation over time. The challenge, then, is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its unique advantages. Because there will always be moments when someone feels: ‘I’m tired of nature; take me to the city!’'"

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques that support this idea. However, I believe there is no strong reason to limit the study of the mind to just the brain or the body. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as brain cells, play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have actively contributed to human development and the formation of the mind. Therefore, I propose that what exists outside our heads may also be part of our minds. It is understandable why we often connect the mind with the brain. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their surroundings. This is practical for neuroscientists, especially when using brain scanners. However, this approach often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. 

I do not want to deny the importance of the brain in thinking, but I want to emphasize that the mind is more than just the brain. It is more useful to consider the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects can become extensions of our thinking or be integrated into our bodies. For example, when we create numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool, we are engaging with materials in a cognitive way. 

MET also looks at how these interactions have changed since ancient times and what these changes mean for our thinking. This approach provides new insights into what minds are and how they are shaped by the things around us. For instance, consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick helps us understand that minds and objects can be seen as connected. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: by using the stick, the blind person can turn touch into a form of sight, and the stick itself plays an important role. 

The stick shows us that human intelligence can adapt and change significantly by incorporating new technologies. I view the human mind as an ongoing project that is always evolving. It is important to remember that, regardless of what form the “stick” has taken throughout history—whether it is a simple stone tool or a modern smartphone—its main purpose is to connect us to the world. 

Through the “stick,” humans explore, learn, and understand their environment, while also finding new paths forward. This is different from how monkeys use sticks to get food. For humans, “sticks” are tools for satisfying our curiosity. This unique ability to engage with material culture explains why humans create more than any other species, and how these creations shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as we interact with the material world. I want to emphasize the importance of material objects in understanding the mind. MET provides a new perspective on how various forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern devices, have influenced who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, it is important to realize that humans have been using such technology since our early evolution."
82,"Text: 'Few inventions have changed the course of civilization as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture at all levels – from practical and scientific uses to industrial and aesthetic purposes, as well as a new world of entertainment that emerged with the camera. Historians argue that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the United States to the visual arts. No other art form has had such a significant impact from the US. This claim reflects the idea that photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discussions, and to fully appreciate its impact, we must look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century. 

Why was this new art form so appealing? First, photography was a mechanical process that matched a growing interest in technology, part of a national mindset that accepted change as normal. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into homes with an immediacy that was astonishing. 

Second, the camera became the preferred tool for representing the self, allowing individuals to create images for public viewing in a society where personal and national identities were constantly being formed and reformed. Third, the camera has been very important for creating and preserving family memories, even if these memories are somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs aligned with a trend towards realism in the work of American artists, focusing on everyday life. 

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. The fact that a photograph is made by a machine, rather than drawn by hand, gives it a unique quality: photographs are records of events, people, and things; they are at least records of what was in front of the camera, which gives them a sense of objectivity. However, because each photograph is taken by a specific person, it also carries a subjective point of view. 

We may look at a photograph and think we understand its meaning, especially if we recognize the subject. This has led to photography being called a ‘universal language’ since its inception. But the meaning of photographs is more complex. Few things in front of us – whether a person, object, or event – convey their own meaning; and no image is presented to us without some context that shapes our understanding of it, such as a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. 

To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and role within a specific cultural context: Why did the photographer take the image? How did people first view it? Additionally, the same image might be seen in different places and times, leading to different meanings. 

While the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized for a long time, it is now clear to contemporary artists. For several decades, starting with U.S. artist Andy Warhol’s use of photographs in his paintings and silk screens, artists have been integrating photographs into their work in various ways. In summary, photographic vision has become an essential part of painting in the history of art, rather than being seen as separate from it.'"
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, which gives us some understanding of what this means. Although we can study this concept in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains somewhat difficult to grasp. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements: thoughts, feelings, a physical world that exists in time and space, and a way of knowing about these elements. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, which may or may not be influenced by scientific facts. 

This personal knowledge can lead us to make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We often act as amateur psychologists when we share opinions on complex psychological topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in a given situation. Psychologists help us differentiate between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts.

Psychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind or brain. While psychologists study the brain, they do not yet fully understand how it works in relation to our hopes, fears, and behaviors during various experiences, such as giving birth or watching a football match. It is often not possible to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us.

A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not directly observable like a machine's. We can only perceive them indirectly through behavior. Studying psychology is similar to solving a crossword puzzle; it requires evaluating and interpreting clues. These clues must come from careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical analysis that can be publicly examined. 

Psychology often involves complex interactions, and understanding them requires advanced techniques and theories. Like any other science, psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or change the processes it studies. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply findings to real-life situations. Psychological research has been beneficial in various fields, such as improving teaching methods, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings better.

Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation of these questions has only occurred in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to find answers. They aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today, but introspection has clear limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only allows us to see a small part of the mind's automatic processes. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Therefore, modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than on personal reflections."
84,"Text: 'In a storehouse in a typical business park in Michigan, USA, lies a collection of failed consumer products – a contrast to the positive, success-driven culture of modern marketing. Here, you can find items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, both of which were not popular. This collection, now owned by a company called GfK, is informally known as the Museum of Failed Products. It showcases products that were taken off the market because few people wanted to buy them. The museum’s owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product tells a sad story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. 

What is most surprising about the museum is that it exists as a profitable business. You might think that any serious manufacturer would keep a collection of their own failed products. However, the executives who visit the museum show how rare this is. They seem to avoid thinking about their failures and often do not keep samples of their unsuccessful products. The museum itself was an unexpected success. Its creator, Robert McMath, originally wanted to create a ‘reference library’ of consumer products, not just failed ones. Starting in the 1960s, he began buying samples of every new item he could find. What he did not realize was that most products fail. By collecting new products without discrimination, McMath ended up with mostly unsuccessful items.

Today’s culture of optimism may explain why these failed products made it to the museum. Each product likely went through meetings where no one recognized it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into a failing product to try to save face. Little effort is usually made to understand why the products failed; everyone involved may have agreed, perhaps unknowingly, to never discuss it again. 

This focus on optimism is especially common in the growing ‘self-help’ industry. A popular idea here is ‘positive visualization’: if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to happen – or so the belief goes. Research by neuroscientist Tali Sharot suggests that a healthy mind may be inclined to see the chances of success as better than they actually are. Her studies indicate that well-adjusted people often have a less accurate and overly optimistic view of their ability to influence outcomes compared to those who are depressed.

But how effective are these ‘positive fantasies about the future’? This is the question that psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have been exploring. Their findings are surprising: spending time imagining how well things could go often reduces people’s motivation to reach their goals. For instance, groups of people who were encouraged to think about having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our experiences with failure are shaped by our beliefs about ability. Dweck explains that people with a ‘fixed mindset’ believe ability is something you are born with, while those with a ‘growth mindset’ think it develops through effort and challenges. People with a fixed mindset find failure particularly distressing, seeing it as proof that they did not measure up. A common example is a sports star who thinks of himself as a ‘natural’ but fails to practice enough to reach his potential. In contrast, those with a growth mindset view failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles grow by being pushed to their limits, where they tear and heal, becoming stronger. The deeper message is that having a growth mindset is a more positive way to approach life, regardless of whether it leads to success.'"
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many of us think we understand, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we once accepted is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to discover what helps players perform their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. At the same time, investors want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

What does this mean for fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. This may lead them to confuse cause and effect. People often think that events are best explained by the order they remember them, rather than how they actually happened. When a team advances, home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal, causing the crowd to erupt. Fans tend to remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, forgetting the many times their cheers did not lead to success.

However, there is one common belief among fans that scientific evidence supports. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a well-known experiment, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another group watched in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team than those who watched silently. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers concluded that referees try to avoid extra stress from making calls against the home team. They do not simply follow the crowd; they aim to avoid the crowd's anger.

Recent studies on home advantage have looked at long-term trends. They show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. One reason for this may be travel, which used to be difficult; now, football players travel in great comfort, and if their hotel is not good enough, someone from the club will find them a better one. Local conditions used to vary greatly, but now top stadiums are increasingly similar in their efficiency.

Despite these explanations, none fully explains the data. These changes—pampered players, modern support staff, and similar stadiums—have all happened relatively recently. The mystery remains why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the greatest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason might be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and baseball focuses more on individual matchups between batter and pitcher. Team sports require coordination among teammates. In basketball, success depends on all players working together, which builds confidence in their ability to connect on the court. This confidence seems to grow from the familiarity of playing at home, regardless of playing conditions.

Another possibility relates to a more aggressive side of sports. Researchers found that players’ testosterone levels were normal before training and away games but increased by up to 67% before home games. This territorial feeling may connect to a basic instinct to defend their home ground, as seen in the recent Rugby World Cup. In two notable games, underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing determination and a refusal to be intimidated—clear signs of home advantage. As one referee put it, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’"""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous among dedicated athletes and their coaches. The reason is clear. First, there is debate about who originally said it, with many golfers from that time being suggested. Second, the meaning is not straightforward. Player did not mean 'lucky' in a literal sense; he was being ironic. His true message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ But there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, relates to the nature-nurture debate – whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice. However, it is misleading to call it a debate, as it suggests a fair balance. In reality, the evidence strongly favors nurture. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent in sports, music, business, and other areas comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that anyone can become an expert with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has inspired many popular books, including Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, Talent Is Overrated, and Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice. These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor, concluding that ‘10,000 hours is both necessary and sufficient to make anyone an expert in anything.’ However, as Epstein discusses in his engaging book, this is often not the case. He points out a major flaw in much research on excellence: it usually focuses only on successful individuals. ‘Science is much better at looking at an elite athlete and suggesting why that person is succeeding after the fact.’ Are there other ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not? Epstein travels the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and from the Caribbean to the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the key to success in the toughest sled dog race may be the dogs’ drive and desire, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary. Some interpretations of the 10,000-hours rule assume that commitment and determination are choices. But what if, as the huskies’ case suggests, a person’s drive has a genetic basis? Such examples highlight the complexity of the topic. Epstein differentiates between hardware (nature) and software (nurture), agreeing that elite athletes need both. He does not deny the importance of training or environment, suggesting that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, he also examines cases where genetics play a crucial role. He raises important questions about race and gender, asking: ‘If only practice hours matter, why do we separate men and women in sports?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""
87,"Text: 'A recent international report shows that many children in rich, developed countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, whether watching TV or using computers, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main issue. This idea connects with other discussions about childhood today. A follow-up study interviewed some children to understand their feelings better. The study found that many children do not wish for more technology; instead, they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults over 40 often talk fondly about their own childhoods, remembering how they spent long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They believe this was much better and healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they are the ones who created this protective environment for their kids, avoiding risks like building forts in old sheds. 

Griffiths’ book contains strong arguments. She discusses the fear parents have about dangers in the outside world and how this fear leads to more child-focused consumerism. Parents wanting to keep their children safe often buy toys and gadgets to keep them entertained at home. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or requiring kids to wear goggles during traditional playground games. While I am unsure how common these strict rules are, Griffiths expresses her frustration with great passion, and she also inspires readers to think about childhood freedoms and rules, from fairy tales to school regulations. 

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas, ignoring important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares the treatment of children today to a subtle form of racism, calling it ‘really ugly.’ Part of the issue is that Griffiths has a romantic view of children. Although she acknowledges that ‘children can be mischievous,’ she mostly presents an idealized view of them that may not match reality, especially when dealing with a lively group of young children. It would be hard to convince an average parent that, as Griffiths says, ‘children are the musicians of thought.’ Perhaps they could be if given the chance, but I have my doubts. 

One of the main ideas in the book is that children should have the freedom to explore, take risks, and learn from their experiences. Griffiths believes that children need to face some danger to learn how to manage risks. She writes, ‘Children need accidents,’ suggesting that small accidents help them avoid bigger ones later. However, she does not explain how we can create these small accidents safely. Also, do all children really want the ‘wild’ experiences Griffiths admires? What about those who are naturally shy, prefer to stay home, or are more cautious? Perhaps the real issue is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too far.'"
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill is not just from my education. Many life problems cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers learned in school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play. 

My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those that need to learn the most play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. 

Play is the natural way that adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling their impulses and emotions. Creativity is essential for success in today’s world. We no longer need people who just follow instructions or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce. 

The creative mind is a playful mind. Adults we call geniuses are those who keep their childlike creativity throughout their lives. Albert Einstein said that school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what that would mean, which helped him develop his theory of relativity. 

We cannot teach creativity, but we can stifle it through schooling that focuses on fixed questions rather than children’s own inquiries. More importantly, children need to learn to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born with a strong desire to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which are essential for their future. 

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players understand that to keep the game enjoyable, they must keep others happy. This ability to quit makes play a very democratic activity. 

However, school has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework is more, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, adult-led sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. “Play dates” with adults present have replaced unsupervised play, and adults often feel they must intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. 

These changes have happened slowly but have had a huge impact. They are caused by various social factors, including parents’ fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to follow their natural desire to play and explore, so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is a new way to get noticed compared to the old method of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, this increased access also means there is a higher risk of making mistakes. 

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many influential contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him. Instead, the executive was offended by the idea of sharing her contacts with someone she didn’t know. She rejected his request and sent a harsh and sarcastic message that quickly spread online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret her tone, if not her message. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for professional purposes, it could ultimately help them.

Social media can be a risky tool for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. Ironically, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of young people for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress others and create a different identity. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. With the right pictures and songs on your Facebook page, you could seem like a more interesting person. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. For some young people, the line between personal and professional use is not clear. They may still think that being bold and confident online is a good approach. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you are a good candidate. Young people need to understand that what they learned about social networking as teenagers does not apply anymore. They must meet employers’ expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too familiar and come across as arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of young people as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt their chances of getting hired, even though they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, such as doing research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of receiving a helpful response. Avoid sending generic emails, and keep your tone respectful to prevent leaving a negative impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it requires careful use to avoid being ignored."
90,"Text: ""Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. The numbers show that newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by one-third to one-half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of US citizens, down from 45% in 2001. Many people confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist in New York claimed that books and theatre were finished and that the daily newspaper would become the most important source of information. Yet, theatre survived not only the newspaper but also cinema and television. Radio has thrived in the age of TV, and cinema has continued to do well against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once a new form of media, and it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This was not only because producing timely news for a large audience became possible in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railways, and telegraphs, but also because people began to understand that everything around them is always changing and that they need regular updates. In medieval times, people did not think this way; they only recognized the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life, as writer Alain de Botton describes, was 'inevitable and cyclical,' with the most important truths being those that repeated. Before the 19th century, journalism as a profession where one could earn a living hardly existed. Even then, there was no clear reason why most people needed news regularly, whether daily or weekly. In some ways, the regular publication of newspapers and their fixed format can be limiting. Online news allows readers to choose when to read based on the urgency of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms help us customize news to fit our interests. When major stories happen, online news can provide updates every minute. Mistakes and misunderstandings can be corrected almost immediately. There are no space limits that restrict storytelling or analysis, and readers can often access full documents or events mentioned in news articles. This is very different from the limitations of newspaper publishing. Yet, few news providers seem to recognize the potential of the internet to enhance understanding and knowledge. Instead, the focus is often on being the first to report news, increasing reader comments, and creating excitement, which adds to confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in busy marketplaces or taverns, where truth competed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be returning to that environment. Newspapers have never been very effective at explaining how the world works. They may be facing extinction. Or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling that we live in 'an unchangeable and chaotic universe,' newspapers will find that they alone can lead us to wisdom and understanding."""
91,"Text: 'If humans truly belonged under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many night animals do. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genes, even if we don’t think of ourselves as daytime beings, just like we don’t think of ourselves as primates or mammals. Yet, this is the only way to understand what we have done to the night. We have changed the night to suit us by filling it with light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While it has benefits, it also brings problems – known as light pollution – which scientists are just starting to study. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and rhythms that many living things, including us, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects various life aspects – migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lights, and there were no public gas lights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. We have illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. Among mammals, the number of night-active species is incredible. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. The effect is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by searchlights or gas flares, circling endlessly until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours because of artificial light. It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Unlike astronomers, most of us may not need a perfect view of the night sky for our work, but we, like many other creatures, do need darkness. Rejecting darkness is pointless. It is as important for our health as light is; changing our internal clock can lead to various health issues. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping in our lives reflects the regular pattern of light on Earth. These rhythms are so essential to our existence that disrupting them is like changing our center of gravity. In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. Living in our own created glare, we have disconnected ourselves from our evolutionary and cultural roots – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a real way, light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, losing sight of our scale, which is best understood against the backdrop of a deep night with the Milky Way – the edge of our galaxy – shining above us.'"
92,"Text: 'The founder of a large international company recently said that his business would stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to have been inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a cheerful email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change seems like a shallow attempt to make the policy seem friendlier, even though it might not be very generous. 

Is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services, including finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn’t hurt the business"" seems better for a smaller company where employees know each other’s work schedules and can judge if their absence would be a problem. The founder of the multinational said employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel completely sure that their team is up to date on all projects and that their absence won’t harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more waiting when you return. 

Someone following these guidelines might not take any leave at all, or would feel guilty about taking time off. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers don’t take enough leave, it could reduce productivity over time. There could also be pressure from colleagues and gossip about who is off and for how long. This pressure already affects when people start and finish work. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a place with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If the security and rights that come with statutory leave are removed, workers might feel they cannot take the time off they need for fear of being seen as lazy. They would lose their legal right to rely on. 

This policy might create a situation where workers feel they cannot take their entitled leave, or they might continue to use their legal rights as a guideline, making the new policy pointless. Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which has blurred the line between work and personal time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees asked how this new way of working could fit with the old time-off policy. If the employer cannot track how much time employees spend working, why should they use a different standard for time off? 

However, a problem with having no set working hours is that all hours could become working hours. Employees might never know if their working hours are being watched by their employer, which could lead them to self-discipline in unhealthy ways. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid annual leave because rest and leisure are important for their mental and physical health. The increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can exist without considering worker well-being. Therefore, I am skeptical that allowing employees to ""take as much holiday as they want"" is truly the intention or likely result of this policy.'"
93,"Text: 'Journal-based peer review is the process of having experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper. It is often seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. This process is believed to filter out flawed or nonsensical papers, and scientists often mention it positively when speaking to the media or the public. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure the trustworthiness of published research? The answer is both yes and no. Examining these issues reveals much about the current state of scientific publishing, which is changing. 

I am not ready to completely abandon journal-based peer review. I still believe that all papers should go through some form of checking before they are published. However, I sense a shift happening. The increasing use of preprints—drafts of papers shared online without peer review—is an important part of this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new results so that others can read, critique, and build upon them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which has affected the motivations of authors and the role of reviewers. The competition for publication in prestigious journals encourages scientists to produce high-quality work, and these journals do publish excellent research. However, the rewards for publishing in top journals can lead to shortcuts, as stories that omit inconvenient data are more likely to be accepted. Reviewers now often focus on whether a manuscript is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, this can depend on how timely or newsworthy the research is, rather than just its scientific merit.

These issues are well known, but many people are hesitant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints might offer a solution because they do not require a major change from the existing system. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they have not been widely adopted. This slow acceptance reflects the conservative nature of scientists and the misconception that journals will not accept papers that have been posted as preprints. There is also concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to 'junk science,' but this has not happened so far.

While preprints are not peer-reviewed, authors understand that they are open to critique and discussion from a global community of reviewers. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shares her experience: ‘My paper critiqued a published paper, which traditional journals do not handle well. In their anonymous peer review system, the original authors might block a critical paper, or if they are not chosen as reviewers, they might complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their feedback. All comments are public, allowing readers to assess the quality of the arguments. The risk of rejection by journals is less concerning since we still have the preprint and public comments, so our work is not wasted.’

Preprint archives allow informal scientific discussions that were once limited to private correspondence. They can also serve as a platform for sharing negative results, which are often overlooked by journals focused on new discoveries. Additionally, being on preprint archives significantly increases how often papers are read and cited, showing the effectiveness of sharing research this way. By embracing the web's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the work itself, rather than where it is published.'"
94,"Text: 'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, I often hear answers like “a painting in words.” These answers usually do not satisfy me or the students. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist would, and another paragraph from the object’s point of view, titled “Poem.” One student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The item? An oxygen mask – an unusual choice that helped the class understand how poetry works uniquely. This exercise led to laughter and helpful discussion. When I was in school, poetry often confused me. I saw every poem as a silly puzzle that blocked true understanding and feeling. After school, poetry tends to attract less attention from most people. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because it is hard to understand at first. Still, you feel proud for trying. What do we hope to find in the poems we read? Isn’t a poem a place for deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp criticism, we read online articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, nothing can compare to that perfect mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. However, one useful aspect of a poem is its ambiguity. Everyday life – unlike reading sentence by sentence – is full of ambiguity. But these thoughts still do not explain what a poem really is. If you search online for “poem,” it redirects you to “poetry”: “a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language.” This is fine academic language, but it misses the word’s origins. “Poem” comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning “a thing made,” and a poet is a “maker of things.” So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – human-made and precise – depending on their views. But these comparisons break down upon closer examination. The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It can help us rethink our usual patterns of thought and see ordinary things in a new way. The idea of a poem as a mental object is not hard to grasp, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody has a power that goes back to schoolyard rhymes like “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.” But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, right in front of you: A poem can resonate deeply like nothing else, even though, on paper, it does no more than the prose around it. What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or advertisement? A poem is created through writing and rewriting, just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a product meant for sale. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry collections, but few expect a collection to make back its printing costs. A poem stands out not as a product for the market, but as something valuable in itself. Because of its unique status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem still has the power to surprise, even if just for a moment.'"
95,"Text: 'I bought my first metal detector shortly after I got married. At that time, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been better spent on something practical for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered has brought me joy. I have always enjoyed feeling connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion as much. 

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that I knew had mostly old farming equipment. When my detector first beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then, it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't walk away without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleared more dirt away, the ball turned into a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before - the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It is the most famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with a gold ring at each end, just like the one I was looking at. 

I took it to my car. On the way home, I kept looking at the torc on the passenger seat. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the only cleaning it had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I called out, ‘I've got something for you.’ As I admired my find, I heard my wife come into the room and stop. ‘What is it?’ she asked after a moment. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we were worried about damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I felt anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath. 

The law says that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I brought it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone with his back to me. When he turned around, he stopped speaking. The torc was confirmed as authentic and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. 

But the torc means more to me than just a lucky find. I feel like I have saved it for the nation. People often say to me, ‘Now that you’ve found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing - not while there’s a chance of catching an even bigger one tomorrow.'"
96,"Text: 'Sleeping is one of my greatest joys when I travel, but I don’t often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share details of their carefully planned trips, where every moment is filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in comfortable beds? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours – more than 12 – I spent sleeping each day. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could enjoy a deep, dream-filled sleep that was better than I expected. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I believe that the quality of sleep while traveling is different for another reason. I think sleep is actually part of our travels, not just a break from them. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. We take in new cultures, music, landscapes, and even different ways of moving. It is during sleep that we process this flood of new experiences. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are traveling. Sleep also changes in rhythm from place to place. People worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For instance, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up at dawn to start their day before it gets too hot, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is high, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to adjust to the island’s different sleep patterns. When I finally adapt to the local sleep schedule, I feel like I have truly arrived. I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a large lunch with new Dominican friends in an apartment overlooking the blue Caribbean Sea. After the meal, feeling full and hot, our conversation faded and eventually stopped. One by one, my friends left the table to lie down on nearby hammocks and sofas. I realized why my hosts had so many pillows on the floor. I took a couple for myself and followed their lead. I had always heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I truly experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a piece of Dominican life. Travel sleep has another wonderful quality: it is memorable. Away from my usual sleep routine, I find joy in the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep in a new place. If a commitment to ‘slow travel’ – enjoying every moment instead of rushing to do everything – is what defines the modern traveler, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my habits and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is, in fact, an important part of the experience.'"
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Please be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said to her customer with practiced politeness. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that resembled a bulldog. ""But it’s so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will make me stand out."" She sighed and adjusted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said firmly, ""this is the one I want."" 

Mia knew she had lost this argument. With a smile, she agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at her daughter’s wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. Today was Jen's thirtieth birthday, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone had been together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen's friend, Tattie, whom they knew nothing about. Her husband, Jeff, had quickly pointed this out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie?"" Jeff had said when Mia shared the news. ""What kind of name is that?"" 

""It’s short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" 

""More like something very pretentious,"" Jeff responded. He did not like pretentiousness or anything showy. He also did not believe in ""beating around the bush,"" as he called Mia’s hesitation to speak her mind. He would have told the woman in the shop directly that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a dustbin lid would look better on her. ""The problem with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" 

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered through the back door of Medlar House; her commute from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia had the idea to convert the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff had been doubtful. ""Do you really think there’s a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from her friends that finding the perfect hat for special occasions was difficult, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women traveled from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where she provided a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere for them to try on as many hats as needed. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she had expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry as well."
98,"Text: 'It’s a long journey from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident but seems surprised by how far he has come, from competing in an Olympic final in discus to possibly starting a new chapter in his life. Although he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still figuring out what his new position involves. The idea that a 21-year-old newcomer from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports is surprising. However, Lawrence is known for proving doubters wrong. After being accepted to study law at Oxford University, he decided to focus on training for discus instead, having previously played rugby. Within 20 months of starting, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence initially went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. 

When asked about his unexpected chance at a big NFL contract, Lawrence confirms, ‘American football was on my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA. I had thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then.’ Soon after arriving in America, he learned about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Did he think he would be good enough to attend the trials, even without any experience? ‘Pretty much,’ he replies. ‘I went online and applied.’ Was he nervous about competing against experienced players? ‘No,’ he says. ‘I don’t get nervous for many things.’ Although he is not very talkative, he is confident in his abilities. The results from various tests showed that he was the most impressive player. ‘I was very happy to hear that,’ he admits, showing a rare moment of pride.

However, he remains cautious. With no basic experience, how can he make it into an NFL team? ‘Coaches have told me I have the right qualities. It’s all about how hard I work,’ he explains. Will he be relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? ‘I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I’m definitely going to be chosen, but I’m not too worried.’ This calmness may come from his disappointing Olympic final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that experience and is proud that he qualified for the final with a strong last throw. ‘That was an amazing day,’ he says. ‘The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can always return to it.’

After his Olympic disappointment, some speculated that he let the experience affect him. Lawrence chooses not to comment on that. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial reasons are clear. Lawrence has moved from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? ‘I understand why someone would think that,’ he replies. ‘I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can always go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out carefully.’"
99,"Text: 'We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, it had not yet started to change in Siberia. I could see no signs of human life, and the view stretched out in a strange mix of mountains, streams, and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, pronouncing my name with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow flying to the far reaches of civilization to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with the help of a dictionary, I managed to explain that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. “But, Robert,” he reasoned, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it these days. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and with one word, “Holodna” (cold), he pointed outside. I tried to support my case by explaining to Sergei with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I left out the fact that, because my trip was self-funded, I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment had been bought at low prices. In reality, I was not sure they would be good enough. This was especially true of my large postman’s over-trousers, which I had bought for £10. It had all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall that morning was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In the row in front of me slouched Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. “OK,” it said. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job did meet many important needs for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventuring bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. Ever since that first ride together, Al had been setting himself greater challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times he thought that the ride would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the skeptics who told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive.'"
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was healthy, and the second stated that I would empty my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay oriented throughout the experience. “The horizon is your best friend,” I was told, and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I was also asked to promise that when flying upside down, I would “completely relax and try to enjoy the view.” 

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was instructed not to touch anything. As we were taxiing down the runway, my legs were up, my feet avoided the important steering pedals, and my hands stayed away from the many switches within reach. Despite the instructions, I found it hard to relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To survive without fainting, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense up and relax at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea. 

As we began to accelerate down the runway, I felt nervous. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world, ready to take off. The plane lifted off, and two seconds later, we sharply turned to the right. It was a sudden, intense move, and I felt the air rush out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into the seat. For a brief moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out, turned sharply left, and dived, leaving my stomach behind at 2,000 meters. Seconds later, we were just 10 meters above the ground, heading for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, but my moment of excitement was interrupted by another sharp turn. 

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, but my hand shook so much that the plane shook too. It was very responsive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yup.” “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane up and over, completing a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this thrilling, like those who enjoy roller coasters. However, I thought it was a bit overwhelming. At the top of the loop, while upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes and felt “soft” compared to what the pilots experience during races. To illustrate this, Dario took out some sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about the loop over and over again."
101,"Text: 'Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been impressed by videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. His ideal temperature, he says, is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up taking the crew to different locations, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater,"" he explains. He is now a leading cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series. ""I started at a good time. When I began, very few people had been to Antarctica. There were people who focused on coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became known as the cold man. It felt like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed."" The camera and communication technology were very basic when he started 35 years ago. ""It is definitely easier to film today. If you filmed something back then, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much material."" ""My strength is my experience in cold conditions. I have a good sense for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice that it now feels as easy as crossing the street. I do get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes."" Wildlife filming, Allan says, has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify the birds. Recently, when Allan got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a place of polar bears and is only for the bravest or most reckless. Usually -32C in April, the wind is harsh, and carrying cameras through deep snow is very difficult. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on day 24, he felt like he was living in the world of bears, moving at their speed and sensing like them. ""We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch, and run to stay warm. After five hours of watching, with no warning, I catch a glimpse so quick that I almost miss it. But the camera is focused on the hole, and my eye is quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds, and then I see an unmistakable black nose. The nose becomes a muzzle, then a full head, and in less than a minute, she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She looks at me but is not bothered. I just pulled back from a close-up, thinking it can't get much better, when she slides down the slope. I would swear it’s partly for fun,"" he recalls, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ""Clearly, it’s their first view of the world. It’s showtime on the slopes, and we have front-row seats."" Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience its effects firsthand. He believes he could create an extraordinary documentary.'"
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even more challenging expedition. Explorers are confident and determined people, and this time, there is much more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer trek to the North Pole, where they will carefully measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen understands that the results will be very important for scientists. This will provide a clearer understanding of how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar regions.

Pen was prepared for this work from a young age. His father’s old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, took care of him and toughened him up by sending him out into harsh weather with minimal clothing. His father also inspired a love for adventure in cold places, and Pen developed great physical endurance. He is married to Mary, a horsewoman who shares his passion for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home, saying, “He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic.” For fun, Mary once raced against him in a well-known mountain event where horseback riders compete against runners. She and her horse finished an hour ahead of Pen.

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He admits, “It’s much harder to be away from them this time.” When he last left, his children were one and five years old, and he made a mistake in how he said goodbye. He told his son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” His son took this seriously and often asked his mother how she was, but the pressure became too much for him. Although Pen meant well, he realizes it was unfair. For similar reasons, he plans to have very little contact with his family while in the Arctic, saying, “If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.” In the days before he leaves, he is carefully preparing his equipment. “Out on the ice, it’s almost impossible to fix things or do anything complicated,” he explains.

Joining him will be Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support crew of six people who will fly in supplies. Pen finds being part of a team more stressful, and he is also concerned about his age. “I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done much less training than I’m comfortable with.” He feels that organizational tasks always seem more urgent, making him anxious about what he will demand of himself.

Pen believes his mission connects exploration with the quest for knowledge that inspired earlier explorers. “Reaching the North Pole was mainly a personal goal,” he admits, “and it had limited value for anyone outside the polar adventure community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we want to involve as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,” he says. “Our skills, which may seem strange and unnecessary in other contexts, have become very relevant. Suddenly, we are socially useful again.”"
103,"Text: 'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Although I enjoyed these different activities, I felt there was nothing competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay fit so I could compete for an Olympic spot if that dream came back to me. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle’s invitation: “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very interested. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But part of me liked the idea of being an underdog with no pressure. I contacted Ben. He was going to enter the race anyway and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a better chance than most, but it would still require effort to secure it. Besides the race costs, I also had to consider the loss of income from being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It is nice that people are interested. However, I find it difficult to talk about my past achievements without having a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just be discussing my past; I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My preparation for the Olympics was hard, with my life focused on getting in the best shape; but looking back, it was quite simple. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training plan was clear, and there were doctors and dieticians. I was worried about how people would see me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, or else I would have chosen a better partner to win the race. My worries faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing; it’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island for a year. However, he couldn’t row well. I was surprised by how little natural ability he had with a boat, and he was shocked by my lack of understanding. I could have been more patient, but I felt it was important to be honest with Ben about the big improvements he needed to make. I should have realized that this was his level when I agreed to race with him.'"
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, perhaps because I was tired of the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips ranging from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but soon had more than 100. Recently, they took over a second property called the 'wilderness farm,' which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I understood what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical.' I started packing right away. 

November 6, London: On my flight, I stared blankly at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names before I arrived, but I felt distracted and anxious. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. However, I felt like I was seeing winter moving south, with rivers freezing over.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta: The bus ride north was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests of thin conifer trees weighed down by snow, stopping occasionally for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?' Anna asked. It was a rhetorical question. I followed the sound of barking, which grew louder as I reached the dogsheds. Three people were running back and forth, pulling the huskies out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs were excited, straining against their ropes. I could barely introduce myself, but the others were too busy to talk. I stood on the sidelines and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestured for me to join in – 'Get in!' – and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and with a jerk, we were off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

November 15, Hetta: It didn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I faced a discouraging quiz about what I could contribute. 'Are you useful?' Anna asked. I was unsure. Further questions revealed that I was not: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving license?' someone asked finally. I nodded, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding are easy to learn: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, no matter what, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seemed complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs became difficult in freezing conditions. A bowl of water would freeze solid quickly, so we had to make a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head was spinning with instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled around by eager huskies. But I felt proud. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,' I emailed my friends. 'In the snow.'"
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. It was noted that her time would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a natural treatment recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman to heal injuries Radcliffe suffered when she accidentally ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe says that the achievement didn’t fully register with her at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a significant moment, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day, so it felt natural. She and her support team had decided not to set any limits, following their motto: no limits.

During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could maintain her fast pace, fearing she might drop out of the race. Hartmann was upset by this concern, although he acknowledged that anyone unaware of her fitness might see it as a risk to start so quickly. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe began to calculate her finish time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. After running 41 kilometers at high speed, she managed to sprint the last distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, “I can run faster than that.” She remembered race director Dave Bedford saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a while, and she thought, “I will come back and do it next year.” Unfortunately, that did not happen.

After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete with such an unusual running style had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had spent weeks with Radcliffe, providing daily training sessions to support her as she covered 250-300 kilometers each week. He said, “I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one on the treatment table could handle that level of pain. She would tire me out because I had to work so deeply into her muscles; I would have to ice my thumbs afterward because I was in so much pain.” Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, “Gerard, you’re 15 minutes late, Paula’s waiting.” There was no greeting or offer of tea; she was ready for a two-hour training session. “Paula would push you to your limits. That’s what made her so good.” 

During that time, Hartmann dedicated so much of his time to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? “Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought it would happen with Mary Keitany, a two-time London marathon winner. Maybe it’s because people are racing against each other instead of racing against themselves.” What does she mean? “That mental attitude of never easing up, even when you’ve won the race, probably pushed me to my best because I never thought, ‘I can relax now.’ It was always about pushing as hard as I could.” Radcliffe did not realize at the time, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run that fast again, but she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. There was a lot of discussion about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain, and I believed we had created a series that contributed something new to this movement. However, I worried whether people would appreciate a cooking style that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science. I watched the first episode feeling both excited and anxious. I needn’t have worried. The show became very successful, leading to many other interesting projects, including a book based on my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each linked to its own TV show. In these, the journey was often physical, involving passports, suitcases, and travel plans. The latest in the series, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who finds joy in making golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even the simple task of choosing which dishes to include in the series was challenging, and I knew I would disappoint many by leaving out their favorites. I could imagine people asking, ‘Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that would satisfy everyone. This confirmed my belief that each person has their own idea of perfection, shaped by their emotions, memories, and environment. Despite the book’s title, I knew I wouldn’t claim the recipes were ‘definitive’. I believed that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation—trying ideas and refining them until something unique is created. The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before, and I was excited to connect food with memory and nostalgia, as I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, such as visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which forced us to stop filming there! While refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza.'"
107,"Text: 'We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking serious. “Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,” he finally said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field went on for miles. There was not much in it, just grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, because it was best to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything they talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound very sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van down the road to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café that was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it got dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on solid ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home now that our van had to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.'"
108,"Text: 'Lucy was talking at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike her, they were not competing: a guy from Tokyo and a girl from a European city whose name Lucy didn’t quite catch over the noise. They were both about ten years older than she was and spoke good English. They discussed the pieces they were playing, their recent travels, and their future plans. “I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy told them. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, causing her to miss so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which accepted only fifteen pianists her age from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she had been selected. There had been a celebration. Lucy’s dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to plan her repertoire. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t applied herself. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. “I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought, more like you didn’t want to give me the chance to say no. At that time, she believed that causing trouble was the worst thing a person could do, and she didn’t even think about trying to back out. The guy from Tokyo leaned forward as if he had misheard her. “Tanglewood?” “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He exchanged a glance with the girl, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag. It was sometimes hard to know when she was just sharing her experiences or showing off. “It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they’re trying...” “Excuse me,” the girl said, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed. “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were music lovers but also a bit rebellious. “Once. When I was about eight.” He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared at her side. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition.” “Everyone is the competition.” Her grandfather took her around the room and made her talk to everyone he thought was important. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, understanding only part of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after leaving the party, her grandfather turned to her. “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” She liked that part. Being someone important. Even if it meant some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she received. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her any special respect from the kids she had gone to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov piece perfectly. But in places like this, she felt she mattered.'"
109,"Text: ""‘Spending too much time online isn’t good for you. You should spend more time in the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about this topic – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have a large group of real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is now a key part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do – they live in it. This isn’t necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s ‘like the modern version of hanging out at the youth club, where parents used to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club.’ He believes it serves a similar purpose: ‘helping teenagers form their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues and interact with their peers.’ 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time for figuring out who you are. Social networking can help with this: you can share your favorite music or sports, find out what you enjoy, and see that others have different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can be helpful for shy people: ‘Talking online can be easier than in person, and it allows you to practice social skills in a less stressful way.’ 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet individuals with specific interests connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of similar people, you can feel more connected and popular in a different way,’ he says. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘Young people who find new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals, and create their own content are truly making the most of social networks.’ She believes social networking is becoming a creative outlet: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity, allowing photographers to connect, learn, share images, and deepen their skills. ‘This all helps with job prospects and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and build brand awareness – and you need to know how it works to attract customers. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they could all be potential customers. If you connect all those networks, you have your customer base.’ 

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is an important skill in the 21st century and is essential for being employable in a digital world.’"""
110,"Text: 'When people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first idea. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet getaway when they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he thought was the ultimate family bonding experience. “Not enough people do this anymore,” he and my mother said repeatedly before our trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, “There are probably good reasons for that!” 

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a variety of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks, although I had some ways to cope. With barely enough space left for us in the car, we began “The Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our spacious home for smaller places over the next five thousand miles made me wonder what we were getting into. 

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road! The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. I noticed a pattern: deserts turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where the strong smell of sulfur hinted at what was to come. 

At one point, as we climbed to our next stop, we realized that roads marked for Jeeps were best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we went, we saw a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. Disappointment turned to laughter when we took pictures by the huge “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ‘Bear jams,’ where park volunteers helped manage traffic for bears crossing, were common. Our close encounter with a bear on the road (and a nervous park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories. 

As we drove on, life back home faded away, and even the hotel we stayed in, with its problems, couldn’t dampen our excitement. It was a creaky, rustic 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service. But in return, I got to see the most beautiful views I’ve ever experienced. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, my family and I headed back south. My parents were right: you don’t need to travel to a faraway place to find something amazing. 

It was a bit sad to be home together again, but at least I hadn’t fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our wild journey to look through and remember. I knew that the moments I would cherish most would be the unexpected and spontaneous ones.'"
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him, but Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy would spend the next year finishing her final school courses, living under the care of the college Head. It was her last year at school, so it would have been unfair for Amy to move. Amy was happy because she had the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area. She also had free access to the Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. Rose only had vague memories of her grandmother from past holidays, and she had never known her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was eager to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose was unsure why her parents did not get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past, which meant Rose spent summers away from her only other family member. The last time Rose said goodbye to Daisy, she was only ten years old, but her memories were happy. Dahlia had said that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and had a talent for bringing people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips within a week. The thought made her smile. Daisy was not a typical frail old lady; she seemed to attend more social events than anyone else. Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a serious talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time, Rose insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, or go out without asking for permission every time. She believed she could be trusted to do these small things. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother had given her a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, as Dahlia insisted. Rose was thrilled. They all agreed that it would be about trust from now on. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them crossed a line, they would talk about it again. Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This had worked in her favor. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, form bonds, and begin her life again. This was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this would be the last time, as she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new moment in her life, a new piece in the puzzle that was her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to think she might write a novel. ""I believed that writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed challenging, and I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, 'I should try this now.' The novel she started at that age is now about to be published. ""I recently told my former teacher about it, and she was surprised. She thought I would probably write a book when I was 30 or 40. I never considered that—I didn’t understand why I should wait to do something I might be good at.""

It is a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a significant achievement: the story is confident and exciting. Nothing about it, except for the age of its main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support, but she doesn’t. She is independent, spirited, with a bright face and sharp mind, but also a calmness that keeps her from being overly confident. Charlotte recognizes the limits of her youth. When I ask her about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers,"" she laughs. ""I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I’m particularly wise. I was just interested in exploring the idea of taking responsibility.""

Charlotte has a theory about teenagers and how they are often misrepresented in fiction aimed at them. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the socially awkward character. Reading about these types frustrated her. ""What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who aren’t flawed in some way. The message some writers send—though I don’t think it’s intentional—is that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience. This can hurt their self-confidence.""

Charlotte has always enjoyed reading famous fantasy authors, some of whom she thought would inspire her, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""My favorite fantasy books explore deep psychological and life themes. I wondered: is this what I need to do to write a good book, and am I capable of it?"" However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It explains that if the reader starts to guess what will happen, the suspense is likely gone.""

It might be easy to say that Charlotte’s parents, both journalists, played a key role in getting her novel published. In fact, her father’s connection in publishing helped get her book read initially. She recognizes her good luck, as it is difficult for anyone to get a first novel read, regardless of their age. ""Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you’re on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp quickly and flew upwards, arms waving in the air. Even to our untrained eyes, something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, losing both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I had enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers who did freestyle tricks in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I felt that if I tried to join the skateboarders, I would be laughed at. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a large indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, where students practiced their tricks and landed in foam pits – not a realistic start to what awaited us on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their moves for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan cheerfully promised. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope becomes the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which reduces impact. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore what my brain was telling me and to go straight towards the jump. My legs would almost go backward as I neared the launch point, so I landed hard on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two began on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, looking at the snowy mountains outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some drills copied moves we would make while ski-jumping, while others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing as you spun in the air. Gareth provided a running commentary. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – every time I tried, I was aware of the moment before take-off, and then I found myself lying in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more challenges before I finally landed correctly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I forced myself to keep my speed up as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly in the landing zone. Then I noticed both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Text: 'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your palms are sweaty with fear, and your nails are digging into the safety harness. Suddenly, the ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly moves upwards. There is a pause, then a sudden drop that makes your stomach feel weightless. With your teeth clenched, you rush forward, turn sharply to the left, and then go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you let out a scream of fear. But you chose to be here, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks each year. 

What surprises me is that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides designed to attract crowds, are a massive industry. To create the excitement and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. The idea of being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a childhood dream, but it is actually a challenging job. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe, and they also need to introduce new ideas to keep visitors interested. 

While many people think rollercoasters have become more extreme, most of the techniques used today, like the wheels that allow rides to go upside down, were invented by American designer John Miller in the early 1900s. During his time, there were fewer safety regulations, and some rides were quite uncomfortable for passengers. Now, designers must work within the limits set by specialized ride manufacturers. 

I spoke to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer' with a background in aeronautics, said, 'The skill is in putting the pieces together.' Dr. John Roberts, a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that this means quickly alternating between feelings of excitement and safety, so riders feel thrilled but not unsafe. 

To create an amazing ride, the teams behind rollercoasters must develop a strong story, whether it’s a space adventure or a jungle chase, that combines with new features like the tallest drops or the most twists to create a smooth experience. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative fields, intuition, experience, and trial-and-error are crucial. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, added that it helps to be passionate about thrills to understand what riders want and to test the rides before they open to the public. 

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would need to use new technologies like virtual reality. Walker responded that while virtual reality can enhance the experience, it is not a replacement for the physical thrill of the ride. He believes that the real rollercoaster experience will continue to be the main attraction for many years.'"
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both activities in her busy life. “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the instructions of demanding choreographers, and how stressful that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day,” she explains. As a choreographer, she teaches and enjoys working with young students. “A beginner dancer is often open to trying new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they don’t yet fully understand their strengths and weaknesses. This lack of clarity helps them accept even tough criticism. They might challenge me sometimes, but I appreciate their honest feedback.” 

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her actions. “There may be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I won’t go back and choose a new piece. Ideally, I’d like to experiment more and have the option to switch music – it would definitely help improve the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I’m often working on large productions where the music is already decided by the composer and cannot be changed.” 

Miranda does not want to be tied to one institution. “I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. However, I must remember that the theatres and schools I work with have very different methods and styles. So, I need to adapt my approach each time I go somewhere new, rather than just repeat what I usually do. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.” 

The conversation shifts to a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,” Miranda says. “This one tries to show an accurate picture of life in a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer receives many corrections, and I smiled in recognition. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch but very real. The public often underestimates the amount of work and dedication required in ballet.” 

I ask Miranda what makes a great ballet or dance production. “It’s when everything the company has put in – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection may be too much to expect, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and allows for a few mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps are excellent, but something about the costumes or props is distracting. That’s disappointing.” 

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? “People want to label you, and I don’t quite understand that. There’s also a modern trend to focus on developing expertise in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, but maybe one day I’ll be happy to be known for one thing. For now, I just want to broaden my horizons.”"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home on your sofa when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. A friend was giving away his old sofa, which became the main focus of the film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and attached them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I placed my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to keep going. I have gone on many walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads, which allowed me to stop at a café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website.'"
117,"Text: 'When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I felt excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I would not be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked puzzled, he smiled and showed me on board. Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would follow us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I felt nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, though, and I was happy when I finally did it on my own. The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the scenery. As the swims became longer, so did my speed and enjoyment in completing them. I felt less need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come back next year.'"

I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting, which makes it a great job for someone young like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family, so I always flew alone at the beginning and end of each term. When I felt lonely, I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed with me when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for a new path. At the interview, there were many young people, and many were hired. They were often well-qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say, focusing on my strengths and past work experience, rather than just saying I loved to travel, which everyone else would say. This approach helped me get the job! I would recommend this kind of work to anyone because there are many rewarding aspects, though the free flights are not the main reason. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: 'no one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family; even if we don’t see each other often, we are still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. If I do encounter difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again!"""
119,"Text: 'At the summer camp where I work, I enjoy watching the children succeed at activities they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but with encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top eventually. This makes them feel proud. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home. It is not the youngest ones who feel this way the most; it is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We do not allow them to use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and by the end of their week, they come to us to thank us for a great time.

Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call frequently to ask how their child is doing, which is often unnecessary. Their child might be busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to ask the parents to call back later. We often see a certain type of child who comes to camp, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more appropriate, but soon they understand why it is necessary.'"

It opened in London last year after five years in the USA, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was difficult. The UK has stricter rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors based in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The theatre in London is larger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night, with many people wanting to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons each day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

What do his friends think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was relieved that the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 

Although the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said that the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
