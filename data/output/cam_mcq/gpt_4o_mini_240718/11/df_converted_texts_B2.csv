Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also letting many people know where you are, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience, which can seem exciting: wealth, fame, and more. However, we often realize too late that sharing too much can be risky.

In the early days of the internet, a group of online pioneers explored these risks. They faced many challenges, like losing jobs and friends, long before social media existed. These pioneers, known as bloggers, have valuable experiences that we can learn from. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web, which was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a chance to share his own life. He created a personal website filled with stories, photos, and art.

In January 1996, he began a daily blog, and many people were interested in his adventures. Hall was open about everything; he would write about any topic. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the art in his work. However, one day, visitors found his homepage replaced by a video called ""Dark Night."" Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the problem of sharing online remains.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they wouldn’t say in person. However, the internet is not a separate world where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she later got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once a symbol of the risks of sharing online, she has learned to manage her self-revelation. What Armstrong teaches us is important: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."

Some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we do not understand. How can any scientist argue with that? Scientists can sometimes be a bit arrogant, but even the most confident physicist would not say they know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt it was important to warn the public about the film, calling it everything from ‘atrocious’ to ‘very dangerous’. This made me curious to see the movie. 

At first, I did not understand why there was so much excitement. Various scientists made simple statements about how new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It was only when the film talked about some of these discoveries that I began to understand the excitement – discoveries like how water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. However, the movie only provided pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being spoken to by happy people and ugly after being exposed to angry people. 

Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is clear and easy to understand. However, scientists often respond with skepticism. I understand their point. The idea that water can be influenced by thoughts is amazing and could mean there are new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, we need solid proof that this effect is real. Pretty pictures of crystals, while nice, are not enough. 

The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties linked to a type of energy that comes from nowhere, which could be connected to a force that is making the universe expand. The evidence for this comes from many years of research in labs and observatories around the world. 

In fact, discoveries are being made that show the universe is indeed stranger than we ever thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown type of matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy’. Besides the movie, there are also amazing discoveries happening on Earth. Neuroscientists have found that our awareness of events happens about half a second after they actually occur, a delay we do not notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans first appeared and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are connections between life on Earth and the design of the universe. 

Despite what some people might think, science is not close to being complete. In fact, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever. Many natural phenomena cannot be understood as we once thought. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the world’s top physicists are trying to create a Theory of Everything, which would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Overall, many of us believe that the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"Text: ""In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes work together to create a beautiful landscape that I cherish. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which can turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have often switched between writing novels and short stories. My pattern is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing a group of short stories, I feel ready to focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I never write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing may use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was challenging, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this different side of me as a writer. One of my early works, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my beginning as a short-story writer.

One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can take longer). It’s not the same level of commitment as writing a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. For me, writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I will make it through. So, writing short stories is a refreshing change.

Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create a story from the smallest ideas – a thought, a word, an image, or anything. It’s often like jazz improvisation, where the story takes me where it wants to go. Plus, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn’t work out, you can just accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write a masterpiece every time. This gives me comfort. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

When I write novels, I try to learn from both the successes and failures I have in writing short stories. In this way, short stories are like a testing ground for me as a novelist. It is hard to experiment the way I want to within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows I have placed in the world, faint traces I have left behind. I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt at that moment. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy as a writer to share these personal feelings with my readers."""

Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, but it also has practical uses, such as curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but can also pose threats to our existence. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often struggles to do so. It has influenced poets, politicians, and thinkers, and while its beauty is clear to some, its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and the mistakes made by scientists are often ignored or exaggerated.

The history of science is filled with conflict. Old theories are often changed or completely replaced, similar to how new music styles are sometimes mocked before becoming popular. Scientists can be jealous and angry, and conflict is a big part of scientific history. This book will show how scientific ideas have changed not just science, but also many areas of human thought. While science has practical benefits, we will focus on the ideas themselves, appreciating their beauty while also being ready to question them. We must recognize both the creativity and the limitations of the human mind.

Science is always changing. There is always a scientist who is proving another scientist wrong. Most of the time, these changes do not disturb society, but sometimes they challenge our established beliefs. For example, in the seventeenth century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Now, physics has questioned many basic ideas, leading us to understand that observing the universe can change it, and we often do not fully understand our own concepts.

Some people think that the changing nature of scientific theories shows that science cannot explain the universe. However, these changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. For instance, Isaac Newton explained more than the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained even more than Newton. Science may make mistakes, but it continues to progress. 

At the end of the nineteenth century, many physicists believed there was not much left to discover in physics. Then, new discoveries like radioactivity, X-rays, and quantum mechanics changed everything. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people claim that a complete theory explaining everything about the universe is coming soon. 

Science is not just a harmless activity. In the last two hundred years, we have moved from being observers of nature to having some control over it. This has sometimes upset the balance of nature in ways we do not fully understand. It is important for everyone, not just scientists, to understand scientific advances because they will shape the future for our children. Science is now a key part of how humanity thinks about and shapes its future. The decisions made in science can impact budgets, health, and even the future of life on Earth."
5,"Text: 'Since around 2015, after many years of growth, major publishers began to notice that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased in some cases. This raised new questions about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One anonymous publishing executive recently admitted that the excitement around ebooks may have led to poor investments, causing his company to lose faith in “the power of the word on the page.” Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can exist together in the market, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books still comes up. It does not matter if people are trying to predict or dismiss this idea; what is important is that the thought of books disappearing continues to spark our imagination and create strong discussions. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence shows otherwise? The answers to these questions go beyond ebooks and reveal much about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear regarding change and innovation. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium “killing” another often appears with new technologies. Even before digital technologies, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many believed radio would disappear. However, radio survived by finding new ways to be used; people began listening in cars, on trains, and in factories. The idea of books disappearing is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been thought to threaten print books as sources of culture and entertainment. Some believed the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others, imagining a perfect digital future, exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. It is not surprising that the idea of the death of the book appears during times of technological change. This story reflects our mixed feelings of hope and fear about new technology. To understand why these feelings are so common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with different media as they become important in our lives. Many studies show how we develop strong ties with objects like books, televisions, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops when they don’t work. Therefore, when a new technology, like e-readers, appears, it does not just mean economic and social change. It also makes us rethink our connection with something that has become a part of our daily lives. As technology advances, we often miss what we used to know but no longer have. This is why entire industries grow around older products and technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people want original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older form. The same happened when photography changed from analog to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a new appreciation for the physical qualities of “old” books – even their often unpleasant smell. This should reassure those who worry about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be an interesting story about the power of technology and our fear of change. In fact, one way we try to understand change is by using familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings. Easy to remember and share, the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our personal world – and ultimately, of ourselves.'"

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday morning at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest thinkers of the last four hundred years managed their time. I wanted to explore how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By writing about the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to show a different side of their personalities and careers. 

The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I believe, “Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward.” This book is not just about the creative work itself, but about the daily routines that support it. It is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about the writer. 

I face similar questions in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to work on many things a little each day? When time is short, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house, or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not claim to answer these questions, as some may only be resolved individually. However, I have provided examples of how many successful people have faced similar challenges. 

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary and thoughtless, but it can also be a useful tool for managing limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine helps us stay focused and avoid being controlled by our moods. The psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, he struggled with procrastination and could not stick to a regular schedule.

This book began during a moment of procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, while working at a small architecture magazine, I was supposed to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I found myself cleaning my workspace and making coffee. I am a “morning person,” able to concentrate well in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought it would be great to collect them. This led to the Daily Routines blog I started that day, and now this book.

The blog was simple; I shared descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I have gathered a much larger and better-researched collection while keeping the variety of voices that made the blog enjoyable. I have let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. 

I want to acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, said that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He had always wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was not interested in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period; instead, he was fascinated by the very beginnings of life and ancient creatures found in grey rocks.

After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard wondered if he would get a job, especially in the type of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities, but he knew that deserving a job does not always mean getting one. When the Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London opened, he applied, but he did not have high hopes.

On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife. He left home upset, crashed his car into a gatepost, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and the professor who replaced him was someone who disliked him. This professor managed to ensure that Howard got the job. Howard was surprised and grateful, but later learned that it was not because of his skills. He felt a bit disappointed but was mostly happy to have the job and do the work he loved.

Howard often thought about how organized his professional life was, where he could plan and achieve goals, compared to the chaos of personal life. Many people can affect your life, and sometimes a stranger can change everything. This happened to Howard when his briefcase, which had his lecture notes, was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he went back to college, called to postpone his lecture, and reported the theft. After that, he went for coffee and met a colleague who was with a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. 

From this meeting, Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This would be his biggest challenge and help his career. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Text: Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they look like maggots, they are said to have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. One of the challenges Spence and his team are working on is how to make eating bugs more acceptable. Through his research on how our senses work together to create our experience of flavor, Spence is quietly influencing what we eat and drink. This includes the products of large food companies and the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food in detail, a field informally called gastro physics. Many factors affect taste, such as who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and weight of plates and cutlery, and background noise. Spence’s book, The Perfect Meal, co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting facts for anyone who enjoys food. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? And we eat about 35% more food when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others. 

Spence’s lab in Oxford is not very high-tech. He describes it as ""low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff."" There are soundproof booths that look like large safes, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who cannot afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a large food company. In the past, research funded by the industry was often seen as less serious in universities. However, since the government asked universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research has become more accepted. Spence is currently helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He points out that it is important for these companies to help their customers live longer. Surprisingly, many companies have been making these reductions quietly, so customers do not notice the changes. ""Research shows that when you tell people what you’re doing, they focus on the taste and often do not like it as much,"" he explains.

Spence first met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a large food company. At that time, people thought combining science and food was strange, even though food is scientific. Blumenthal helped change this view. Their collaboration led to the creation of the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in Blumenthal’s five-star restaurant. Interestingly, Spence notes that artists from the early 1900s, known as the Italian futurists, were already experimenting with sounds and food, but it did not become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence’s research on the senses in many ways. For example, he found that higher-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. ""It’s surprising how shapes can affect taste, or how a song can change how you experience a flavor,"" he says. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream melts, but they did not match the music to the taste, which is often the case, according to Spence.

What are dinner parties like at Spence’s home? Once, they had rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they played with remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. ""We’ve had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and ten different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Text: 'Our brains are busier than ever before. We are overwhelmed with facts, false information, and rumors, all pretending to be useful information. We have to sort through this to find what we need to know and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more than before. Thirty years ago, travel agents made our flight bookings and salespeople helped us find what we needed in stores. Now, we do most things ourselves. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favorite TV shows, with the help of our smartphones. They have become part of our busy lives, filling every spare moment. 

However, there is a problem. Although we think we are multitasking – doing several things at once – this is a strong and dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says that our brains are not designed to multitask well. When people think they are multitasking, they are actually switching quickly from one task to another. Each time they switch, it costs them mentally. So, we are not like expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried that something will fall. Even though we believe we are getting a lot done, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. 

Multitasking increases the production of stress hormones, which can overstimulate our brains and cause confusion. It creates a craving for constant stimulation, rewarding our brains for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to stay focused, can easily be distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask harms our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this problem info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are even worse than those caused by tiredness. 

Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, found that learning new information while multitasking sends that information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do their homework while watching TV, the information goes to a part of the brain for storing skills, not facts. Without the distraction of TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember. 

Additionally, multitasking often involves making decisions: ‘Should I answer this text or ignore it? How should I respond?’ Decision-making is also hard on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental energy as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can end up making poor choices about important matters. 

In discussions about information overload, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not about disliking email itself, but about the overwhelming amount of communication we receive. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does for work, he said, ‘He answers emails.’ His father agreed that this was quite true. We feel we must reply to our emails, but it seems impossible to do that and accomplish anything else.'"
10,"Text: In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were mostly ignored. Animals had behaviors, those behaviors led to measurable results, and science recorded those results. The idea that animals have thoughts, feelings, and moral systems was considered unscientific. But this has changed recently. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has started to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate that may never be fully answered: do animals have consciousness? This debate leads to another important question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong that guides their behavior? 

In a recent experiment with cows that had to open a locked gate to get food, it was clear that cows who opened the gate themselves showed more happiness – by jumping and kicking – than those who had the gate opened for them. If this research suggests that cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we produce and eat beef? While the observations may not be disputed, their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the only logical response to this new research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is close to a major change in ethics, similar to the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should at least rethink how we view animal intelligence. He says, ""the only reasonable idea is that animals have a simpler theory of mind than ours."" Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop attributing human feelings to animals. These three views may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever truly understand, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks, what it is like to be a bat? 

Balcombe describes an important experiment he conducted that seems to show that starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with plenty of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. At first, both groups were fed tasty worms from one box and bad worms from another, and they learned to take only from the tasty box. But later, when only bad worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, ""We look back with disgust on a time when there was racism. Our view of animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger."" If he were the only one with this view of animal consciousness, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning has written a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" He says, ""What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. At the start of the 20th century, some people thought animals thought just like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are moving back in that direction. But it is a very controversial topic, and we should be careful of academics with strong personal opinions."""

Critical thinking is a way of engaging with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the U.K., believes that arguing can help us find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there are worries that it also changes how we solve complex problems and makes it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are often exposed to poor but attractive ideas, trends, and opinions. The large amount of information available can overwhelm our ability to think clearly. Ironically, having more data does not always lead to better knowledge or decision-making. West notes that the quality of our thinking has not improved much despite the increase in information.

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading literature, with a decline of 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media has a negative effect. She says that less reading may lead to weaker critical thinking skills. People are now more focused on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing.

However, we still do not have a clear answer about how technology affects critical thinking. Because of the growing presence of technology, critical thinking has become more complicated, and experts can no longer rely on old beliefs. It is easy to see computers, video games, and the internet as either good or bad, but they can be both, and different technologies can have different effects. For instance, a computer game might help or hurt critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis skills, but constantly clicking on links can prevent deeper thinking.

Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how people think. She notes that reading helps thinking and imagination in ways that visual media like video games and television do not. Reading develops imagination, reflection, critical thinking, and vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are real-time and do not allow time for reflection or imagination. As a result, many young people may not reach their full potential.

How society views technology affects how it thinks about critical thinking. This is especially clear when looking at video games and thinking skills. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, points out that video games are often seen as harmful to children. However, they can also be a good learning tool. Evidence shows that playing video games can help children develop better reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in engaging environments that mimic the real world. These games also allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to access otherwise. In the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it is important to examine how technology affects thinking and analysis."

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who also writes about how we should live. He chose this job after feeling unhappy with office work and his role in social policy. His first book praised the value of manual jobs, while his latest book discusses how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he saw advertisements on a credit card machine while entering his pin number. Crawford realized that these ads make it hard for us to focus on what we really want to think about. We often do not notice how much our attention is pulled away from our own thoughts. It is becoming harder to think clearly or remember conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people often stop talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we now experience the world through things like video games and apps, which can manipulate our desires. 

Many people share his concerns. For example, office workers often complain about emails but still spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us, making it hard to concentrate, especially during boring moments. While there is no clear evidence that our attention spans are shorter, we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Some believe this problem is caused by technology, but Crawford thinks technology just makes our self-obsession easier. With so many choices, it is hard to control ourselves, which affects our social lives. People prefer texting friends instead of talking to them in person. Crawford warns that by only interacting with screens, we might lose important connections in society.

He uses his gym as an example. In the past, there was one music player for everyone, which sometimes caused disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds, and the gym has lost its social atmosphere. Real connections often happen through disagreements, where people share different tastes and find common ground.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need to manage noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he believes we should engage in skilled activities to connect with the world in a more meaningful way. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real experiences. No video can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or the gravel under a motorbike. These activities require good judgment and awareness of others around us. 

Crawford argues that when we engage with the real world, we see that manufactured experiences are not as fulfilling. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use our judgment in daily life. There are many benefits to this approach, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions can be tiring and makes it harder to focus on what is important. In contrast, paying attention to one thing can help us pay attention to others more easily."

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk, and we often define ourselves by our jobs. However, if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit more complicated. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. It is fine to say you study or teach philosophy, but calling yourself a philosopher might make people think you believe you know some special truth. This idea is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. Still, this stereotype makes me think twice about how I describe myself.

One reason this stereotype exists is that philosophers are seen as people who judge the actions of others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) believed that a life of contemplation, or philosophical thinking, was the best kind of life. While few modern philosophers agree with this, philosophy is still often linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that simply accepting what society says can lead to an unsatisfying life. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices.

However, living an examined life does not mean you have to read many philosophical books or dedicate your life to deep thinking. It just means paying more attention to the everyday experiences that shape our lives to make sure they are meaningful. You do not need to be a wise person living away from society to evaluate life fairly. In fact, examining life can be very practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it is important for a good life.

Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more separated from real-life experiences, especially for those without formal training. This is not entirely the philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations are often linked to expensive academic journals. Because of this, philosophers have little chance to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. For many people, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. While some philosophers have tried to change this view, many have accepted it. As philosophy has become more focused on specific, technical debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand, making it almost impossible for those without training to engage with it. In some ways, philosophy has stepped back from society.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because most of my work is in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I have felt that this title does not fully capture what I do, as ethics is often seen as related to formal rules and laws. There is a new development in philosophical thinking: ethics is now often understood as applied ethics, which examines the fairness of specific social practices. The role of an ethicist today is to decide if certain actions are ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I often explore.

However, philosophy is more than just this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the effects of consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people think more deeply about the actions and beliefs that shape their lives. Sometimes this might confirm what we already know; other times, we may find that our beliefs are hard to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we can benefit everyone."

People who love food, like foodies and chefs, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, throughout history, discussions about food have often been less important than other philosophical topics. When philosophers talk about eating, they usually use it as a way to discuss something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, conversations about food seem to be about food, but they often explore deeper ideas that are only loosely related to food.

One interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. However, his name has become closely linked to a love for eating and drinking. You can see his name in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites. These businesses likely hope to attract customers by connecting their products to famous philosophers.

Food is also a social and cultural experience. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities help us find dining partners and provide the means to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more important ways than with other things, making it a clear topic for philosophical discussion.

Once food is prepared, critics begin to talk and write about it. But why do these critics have such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, good food critics are just better at describing flavors. This area has not been studied much in philosophy, as most research on perception has focused on sight. This should change.

Another important aspect of food is its beauty. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but we rarely talk about the taste of food in the same way. Some philosophers believe that, with the growth of modern cooking, food deserves to be discussed in terms of beauty, just like art or poetry. However, food is consumed when we enjoy it, unlike art, which remains after we experience it. Aesthetic objects need to last over time, so it is incorrect to think of food as something that can be considered beautiful in the same way.

There are also many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? The answers often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers will always question why we choose what we do. This kind of academic discussion about food is important.

Cooking at home and in restaurants can be very different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of their personal relationships. In a home kitchen, everyone comes together to share food and companionship. In contrast, professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, but only to those who are qualified, and their relationships are more like colleagues than friends.

A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food and dining can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: first, we can learn to appreciate others by enjoying their food, and second, we can build personal connections with people from other cultures by sharing meals. This practice has a long history in international relations. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy come alive for readers."

Rob Daviau, from the US, designs ‘legacy’ board games. He felt that the traditional board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging enough anymore. This made him think about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect the next? He changed a classic board game called Risk to create a new version called Risk Legacy. For the first time, decisions made during the game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and players’ past actions become part of the game. Daviau said: “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”

Daviau was then asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a very popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases that threaten humanity. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very well received, SeaFall was seen as a true test of the legacy format because it was the first game that did not follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th to mid-19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world.

Designers of legacy board games must think about all possible player choices to make sure the story stays strong. To do this, they use testers to see how the games will play out. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. The first few games might be great, but then after a few more games, it can start to break. Then you have to go back and fix everything.”

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. When Daviau was developing the idea, he thought it would only appeal to a small group of people. He said, “I thought it was really different and pretty good, but it’s unusual and breaks many rules. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.” However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He believes it is one of the biggest improvements in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment, excitement, and intensity. There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than to learn a new game or a new way to play, and you get that constantly with legacy games.”

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the excitement of a story unfolding was more important than worries about the game lasting a long time. He mentioned, “At first, I was worried about making changes and ruining my board, but that worry went away with Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice in the cinema, right? You’re buying into an experience. It adds a storytelling aspect like in video games.”

The legacy format is inspired not only by video games but also by the popularity of TV series. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer but later moved into advertising and game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said, “You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start, but it’s not enough to just have a general plan.”

Daviau feels proud of his work but is also curious to see how others will use the idea. He thinks that soon gamers will be asking, “What’s new?” Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is not so sure. He believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."

Not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared widely online. Part of the fun of such escape stories, which also include animals like rats and llamas, is that we like to think of animals as being like us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very intelligent and look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in complex ways.

Some people think that comparing animals to humans is not scientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that it is actually a mistake to ignore the human-like qualities of animals. He calls this mistake ""anthropodenial."" He has studied many years of research on animal intelligence and found that, except for having a fully developed language, animals show many behaviors that we thought were unique to humans. These include remembering the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding what others want. In other words, animals are smarter than we often think.

Dr. de Waal believes that anthropodenial is a recent idea. In medieval and early modern Europe, people thought animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world with his theory of evolution, wrote that the difference between humans and higher animals is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, a new way of thinking called behaviorism focused on training animals with rewards and punishments. During this time, many people saw animals as simple machines or robots with instincts. Anyone who believed that animals had thoughts and feelings was often seen as unrealistic or unscientific. This change in thinking happened at the same time that humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly.

Fortunately, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand animal intelligence better. He believes that we are beginning to see that animal thinking is similar to human thinking, even if they are not the same. He says, “The times are changing,” and notes that there is a lot of new information about animal intelligence available online.

Dr. de Waal argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique skills of each species. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we failed, it might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is not completely convinced that Inky’s escape had a happy ending. He believes that while octopuses have escaped before, it is unlikely that Inky knew how to find a drain that led to the ocean. However, he understands that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys could feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers (a food they liked) and others received grapes (which they liked even more), the monkeys with cucumbers became upset when they saw their friends getting grapes. This study was published in a well-known scientific journal, but what really made people believe the results was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our minds work in unique ways."

Robotics, once just a part of science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to what happened during industrialization. Robots have been used in car and factory production for many years, but experts believe we are about to see a big increase in the use of robots in many other areas. Many people think that robots will take over most jobs done by humans in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people also believe their current jobs will still exist in the same way during that time. This shows a common belief that our jobs are safe, but they are not. Every industry will be affected by robots in the coming years.

For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot named Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This job would take two human workers a whole day or more. Another example is Tally, a robot from a San Francisco startup called Simbe Robotics. Tally moves around supermarkets to check that products are well-stocked and correctly priced, rather than cleaning the aisles.

Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot yet fix or program themselves, which could lead to new jobs for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not forget the importance of human skills in the workplace. They believe society is not ready for the changes that will come from reducing human interaction.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His recent report predicts that in two years, nearly one-third of robots will be smarter and able to work safely with humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled because there aren’t enough skilled workers.

Zhang says that automation will affect lower-skilled workers, which is unfortunate. He believes that these workers should not rely on the government to protect their jobs but should find ways to retrain themselves. People can no longer expect to do the same job for their entire lives.

At the same time, advances in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, such as robots that can walk and interact with us in new ways. Zhang sees this as a great opportunity for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe and protect our privacy. With many jobs at risk and a global employment crisis approaching, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future workforce that will include robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is reported to have answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response reflects a common question people have: why do climbers take on such dangerous challenges? Some may find inspiration in his answer, as it encourages people to pursue their dreams and face the unknown. However, it also suggests that the main reason for climbing could simply be for adventure and enjoyment.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different climbing activities, from playing on boulders to climbing high mountains, each with its own rules. He argued that the way climbers approach a climb—like how much equipment they use—depends on the rules of that specific activity. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and casual conversations.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing brings. However, climbing can also feel very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a paradox in climbing. Yet, some argue that having fewer choices can make a climber's life simpler, which can also feel like a form of freedom.

When asked ""Why climb?"", US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes that climbing is part of our nature; humans are built to take on challenges and test their limits, even if it involves risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing may be more about our biology than logical thinking.

US academic Brian Treanor also contributed to this discussion. He believes that climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While he acknowledges that not all climbers show these qualities, he thinks they are especially important in today's world, which often avoids risks. Climbing, then, can have practical benefits by helping people develop traits that allow them to thrive in everyday life.

Another interesting idea is that climbers who do not depend on others or technology must be fully dedicated to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred some debate by claiming that climbs done independently are more challenging and deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or with help from tools like bottled oxygen. This claim raised concerns that it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

We can also explore climbing from a different perspective. Many climbers report experiences like being fully present in the moment or going with the flow. The physical effort of climbing, the focused meditation while climbing, and the intuitive problem-solving involved are all key aspects of the activity. Some argue that climbing techniques are similar to those used in Zen philosophy, which aims to train the mind for peace. This idea offers another perspective on why people are attracted to climbing."
19,"Text: 'For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was an intellectual and serious person who explored and recorded important European piano works. He wrote and performed a lot, but taught very few students. Those who knew him well saw a playful side to him, but this was rarely shown in his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of studying, traveling, and performing. 

Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came backstage at one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had very few students and did not see a reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist: ‘You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ However, there was something special about Kit, who was around 14 years old. Brendel listened to him play and said, ‘He played very well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a recital he had performed, and it was so beautiful that I thought, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that connected every note. It’s rare to find a musician with this kind of understanding and subtlety.’

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is starting to make his way into it. Brendel is careful, worried that Kit might burn out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy outside of lessons, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all while his mother watches over him. He also composes music. Brendel says, ‘This is very important. Learning to read music well is helped by trying to write your own music. I noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and is a great sight reader. More importantly, he listens to his own playing, is sensitive to sound, and understands me when I explain things. When I tell him something to do in a piece, he can apply it everywhere in that piece.’

Brendel pauses and looks serious. ‘I don’t want to raise expectations. I get very upset when newspapers do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century, which is really the worst thing. You shouldn’t say that in a newspaper. It can cause a lot of harm. Like many talented young players, he can play some things incredibly well, while others need more time and practice. It would be harmful if a critic expected him to be perfect.’

Now at 80 years old, it is nice to see Brendel’s gentler side in his retirement. He explains, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous in five years, but I wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I turned 50, I felt I had done most of those things, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Although I don’t have the physical strength now, my mind is always active with many pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform now, but I enjoy this new phase of my career.’"
20,"Text: ""When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a fancy greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass was broken. 

At home, my father was often quiet. He had a sense of humor and enjoyed silly things. He liked to say, ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ instead of just saying, ‘I don’t mind.’ Deep down, he might have felt disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. 

He was good at fixing things around the house. He could build bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once during their marriage. My mother, however, loved to change the furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it made me nervous. I only liked the two brass candlesticks on it. My mother thought they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn’t get the chance, she simply said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

Of the three places to explore – moors, woods, or river – I always chose the river. I could imagine another world there. With a fishing net over my shoulder, I would walk along the riverbank in my old sandals, looking for a good spot to take them off. I would leave my sandals with my picnic and carefully look for fish in the water to catch. After some failed attempts to keep them alive in the backyard, I returned them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as I could, but it seemed impossible until one day my father said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, he went against his usual thoughts. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter. But I like to think that deep down, he hoped things would turn out well if I worked hard. Maybe I’m wrong, but I believe that even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw my enthusiasm for it and noticed my love for plants and flowers."""
21,"Text: Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I do the same. A strong wind threatens to blow us off the steep cliff at our feet and into the ocean below. Then MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and his owner gently strokes him. The howling wind cannot make this man uncomfortable here, on his island, where he feels at home. MacEwen is showing me around his neighborhood. He points to the north and shouts, “That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.” I see dark clouds pouring rain on its tall mountains. “Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 

“I have sheep to move,” MacEwen suddenly says when rain starts to come our way. We walk down the slopes. As we go, he tells me more about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. Herding the sheep interrupts our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to circle a flock of sheep but is not doing it well. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” means the dog should go to the right. Instead, he goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. “Tie,” MacEwen says with disappointment. “That will never do.” The dog looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence works the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. “They go out the door and come back only when they’re hungry.” But life on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait nervously for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. But I manage, even without mobile phone service. “There is mobile reception on the hill,” Mary tells me. “Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone away.” So I do too.

Everything on Muck seems wonderfully surprising. The boat today brings some groceries and three musicians, who jump off carrying their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with the islanders tapping their feet to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. “Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay advertised in the newspaper and bought it without even looking at it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.” Did Jenny know anything about running a farm? “She had good typing skills.”

I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all my food coming from the small island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and deliver it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, delicious beyond words. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to my next island. In the past two months, many scheduled ferries had been canceled because of rough seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I would be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, secretly, I longed for, phone or no phone."
22,"Text: 'The game design industry was once mostly made up of computer scientists and self-taught individuals. It did not offer many ways for people to enter the field. Often seen as just a hobby for young fans, the video games industry is now taken seriously. This may surprise some, but industry experts are not surprised. However, getting into this field is not easy. Video game spin-offs that come out quickly after a new movie need many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it is difficult to enter, but it is growing. 

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, “It is very hard to make progress in big companies or to influence major mainstream games. But the truth is, the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just top-level directors who manage an entire game, but also lower-level designers who create systems and individual parts of the game.” 

So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim disagrees. “There is only one way: make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something, and you won’t succeed on your own if you are not making things. Game design is more than just a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real.” 

Another expert, John Field, sees other options. “There is value in just doing it, but it is more complicated than that. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s requirements today; even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit to truly contribute to this changing field.” 

Can you succeed on your own? “Maybe, but it is quite difficult,” says John. “A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide support and guidance for a year or two. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and have a strong interest in the arts and modern culture. They may have spent some time working after graduation but have realized that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety of the medium. 

Finally, connections can help. This is often overlooked, but to succeed in games, as in many other fields, you need to network.” The old stereotype of a young boy playing video games has changed. Now, video games are seen as a serious medium that attracts a wide audience. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. “Games have become popular for larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this already large area as having many new possibilities and opportunities.”'"

I had a friend who came to the park with us, but his dad was very strict. He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest in football and has not played since. I am glad that did not happen to me, but I know things could have been different. When I score a great goal from far away, people often say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced taking long shots since I was a kid. You can only score amazing goals by practicing. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players collide on the field, but I learned the right techniques. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills. At school, I played many sports, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I don’t want my son to be like that. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope that when he kicks the books around, it doesn’t mean he is just like me. 

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that younger players could join the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He didn’t call us together and say, ‘This is your big chance,’ but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us realize how much we needed to improve. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite his words. I depend a lot on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes create problems. For example, people ask me, ‘Why do you let your mother keep working?’ I have helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong people, and I think they would be upset if they felt they should rely on me. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to help those around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think, and it doesn’t solve all my problems. After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off or even longer to do things I haven’t been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can’t do that now because if I break a leg while skiing and can’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."""
24,"Text: 'Sam Carter was the reason we lived at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. In desperation, he offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father could not write anything while we were there. This was bad for Sam because he could lose clients and money. 

During the summer, the beach was empty because the sun was often covered by sea fog. Reef Point was not a popular spot for day visitors. The road was not inviting, and the nice resort of La Carmella was nearby, so most people chose to stay there. Only those who were broke or really loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, the beach was full of people and activities. My father was busy every day trying to write a script and was in a bad mood. 

Most days, I went to the beach with a book to read and my dog, Rusty, for company. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to join us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father threw a boot at him, but he didn’t really mean it. Rusty knew this and came closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to? He thinks he belongs to us.” My father replied, “You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.” 

Rusty loved the beach and liked to dig things up and bring them to me. Sometimes he found things that didn’t belong to him, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, and I had to return them to their owners. He also loved to swim and always wanted to join me, even though I could swim faster and farther. You would think he would get tired, but he never did. 

That day, we had been swimming. My father had finished his script and went to Los Angeles to deliver it. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in the sea. As the sun began to set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. They would choose a wave and balance perfectly as they rode it to the shore. One surfer caught my attention. She was so good that the others looked clumsy. But then she decided to finish for the day and rode in on a final wave. 

“Hi,” she said, “why didn’t you join us?” 
“I don’t have a surfboard.” 
“You could get one.” 
“I have no money.” 
“You’re British, right? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No. He came here to write a film script based on a novel he wrote.” 
“No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“You mean, Tall as the Morning?” I nodded. 
“I read that book from start to finish.” She looked at me with new interest, and I realized that people were friendly but only showed interest when I mentioned Tall as the Morning.'"

""What have I done?"" Violet Hetherington asked herself. She was standing in one of the long lines at the dock in Southampton. The lines were spilling out of the building marked ‘Departures’ as people waited to board the Queen Caroline. No one was moving. Her friend Annie had told her, ""It’s best to get to the docks late. If you arrive too early, you’ll just be waiting around."" Annie, who was married to a diplomat and loved giving advice, was an experienced traveler. But this time, her advice was wrong.

After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a ""breakdown in the computer system."" This news made the atmosphere among the waiting passengers tense. Some tried to be patient, and a few even tried to be cheerful, but most people became frustrated. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and many felt it was their last chance for a bit of luxury. The fact that they could not board the ship quickly did not make things better. Violet felt like leaving. She reached into her bag for her phone and realized it was missing. This was much more annoying than the long lines. It made her feel that going on a cruise was a mistake. 

Now, she had the problem of her phone. She couldn’t call the taxi company to see if she had left it in the taxi because that number was saved in her phone. This was the very mistake her older son Harry always warned her about. Behind her in the line was a friendly-looking couple. ""I’m sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make a quick call?"" Violet asked. She called Harry using the couple’s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbor, to check if her phone was left behind. If it wasn’t in her apartment, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, ""Thank goodness,"" but she didn’t tell Harry this. Harry believed that, even if he was not older than his mother, he was much more experienced. Daniel, her younger son, was more understanding of her mistakes, but that was because he made similar ones. Dan might forget to give the message to Kristina.

Eventually, the lines started to move, and Violet was directed to a window where she handed over her travel documents and got ready to board. Her heart sank when she entered the ship’s foyer, which looked like a not-so-grand hotel trying too hard. There were shiny fake wood panels, fancy chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets that looked like those found in airports. Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators,’ which were covered in mirrors and filled with tired passengers who might have preferred not to see their reflections. She was pressed against the side of the lift as it moved up, stopping at each floor to let people out. Finally, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out and felt free. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to make sure she had a sea view."

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures to use in a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images taken by Maier, a street photographer known for her amazing ability to capture interesting moments. Since then, Maloof has built a collection of Maier’s life and work. In his home attic, he keeps her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. 

One morning, Maloof looked around at everything he had found. He felt he was on the edge of something special, and it all happened by chance. “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,” Maloof said. “I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily sold it all to someone else.” For a while, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They spoke to families who had hired her as a nanny and talked to people at the shop where she developed her film. 

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be a private person but had a unique personality. She always carried a camera with her and wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. “On her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,” said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. “I remember her as a private person but one who had strong opinions about movies and politics.” 

Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Although she was not very social, she would walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her “second job” of documenting the world around her. “She was a true artist who followed her dreams,” said Rydzon. “She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.” 

Maier’s work is a pure form of art; she did not create it for money. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. “What is interesting about Vivian is that she has so many captivating pictures,” said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees influences from other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her own style. “Was Vivian very skilled, or did she take ideas from those who came before her?” 

Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. The funny thing is that he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. “As I improved as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized that the cityscapes were not what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,” he said. “There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to share her name and get Vivian Maier into the history books.”"

When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it has not completely succeeded. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, *The Luminaries*. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she seemed calm, especially since she was still in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She pressed her novel against the glass. The official looked at it and asked, “What’s it about?” This is not an easy question for an author. 

*The Luminaries* is set in New Zealand during the 1860s. A series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men has come together to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past gave her more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. At over 800 pages, the book is “big by necessity” because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good chance to shine.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she answered in a thoughtful way. “It’s nice coming from a small country like this because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. There’s a family-like feeling at home; I got a lot of praise from other people’s grandmas.” She also mentioned that it annoys her when people think her book is not a serious work.

“I wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral,” Catton explained. “Each part is half the length of the part before it.” The story speeds up as it goes along. I asked if it matters whether readers notice these patterns. “I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could find them in the book.” 

Despite its unique structure, *The Luminaries* is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she said she did not know how the story would end before she wrote it. “I would try to write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be to get out of that situation.” One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also talked about her love for television dramas. I asked if she might be interested in writing for TV. “That could be pretty cool,” she replied. She spoke with excitement and laughed softly. She lights up when discussing her writing and New Zealand. “I notice when I come to Britain how much my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for busy cities to be around more people.” But for now, New Zealand will still be her home. I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."

As a boy, Jonny Kinkead spent his time either making things in his dad’s garage or playing the guitar. For the last forty years, he has been building steel-string acoustic guitars by hand. “I am still amazed by the guitar,” he says. “How can two pieces of wood create such a beautiful sound? And using different types of wood can change the sound too. It still surprises me.”

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. When he turned sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. “Some people would get a part-time job to save money for one,” he says. “But I thought if you wanted something, you should make it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and types of wood affect the sound.”

The bass guitar was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making model boats and airplanes for a long time. “We drew designs and then built them, so I knew how to do it. My father taught us how to use tools like saws and chisels. I had also been fixing instruments for my friends.”

Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a career at that time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he decided to study architecture at university because it involved design, which he liked. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out. “I was too independent for it,” he says. “But I left with a better idea of what I wanted to do. I was still interested in sculpture, but I realized that building guitars is a type of sculpture too – it shapes sound. I thought it might be a more practical career than pure art because I would be making things that people use.”

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time to earn extra money. The first guitars he sold were only for the cost of materials, but as he became known as one of the best guitar-makers, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is “still scratching a living.” He admits he can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.

In the early years, it was important for him to get known. He would go to music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him to their friends. He also had to learn how to price his instruments because he didn’t naturally think about money.

Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. “When I started, many people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were good,” he says. “UK-made guitars were not seen as real, even though we have always had good instrument-making courses here. Now, our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.”

Jonny thinks new instrument-makers should take courses to learn valuable techniques. However, he also believes that learning through trial and error is important. “You should look at other instruments, see what works and what doesn’t, and try different things,” Jonny says. “If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you learn from someone else, you may only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.”"
29,"Text: ""When we talk about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a common tradition, and I will mention the famous saying by the 18th-century writer Dr. Johnson: 'When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather.' This saying is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many people stop here or try to explain why the English are 'obsessed' with the weather, but they often get it wrong. They think that when we talk about the weather, we are really interested in it. 

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not interesting at all. He points out that in England, we do not have extreme weather like tornadoes or big storms, which makes it less exciting. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that while we may not have tropical storms, living on the edge of an ocean means we can never be sure what the weather will be like.

From my research, I believe that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather itself. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to connect with each other. For example, when someone says, 'Nice day, isn’t it?' or 'Ooh, isn’t it cold?' they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to start a conversation or fill a pause.

Talking about the weather is similar to how monkeys groom each other. They spend time grooming, even when they are clean, to bond socially. There are specific situations where we use weather talk. Some people say that the English talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. There are three main situations for weather talk: as a greeting, as a way to start a conversation, or as a topic to fill silence when other topics run out. 

This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather a lot. A conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to more weather talk, and return to it when there is a pause. This can make it seem like we are obsessed with the weather."""
30,"Text: Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip, choosing it over exciting tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they really wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. When she could not find a suitable historical novel to help her explain life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started her new career as an author in 2001. She felt that writing was a big change for her. “Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very demanding. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not as tiring. My former teaching colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my stories,” Alice says. 

Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. “Many young adult books focus on negative experiences. They are well written, but often they are dark or completely fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different.” Alice always tried to teach English and History together, like lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy. She loves the moment when a child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. “I enjoy having bored children because it challenges me to make them interested,” she explains. 

Alice was inspired to write her first novel because she saw a gap in the market, but she also felt the change coming as her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. “I had been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me, but I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I didn’t think I needed.” Before she could join the course, she had to send the tutors her best piece of writing, which she only learned about a few days before leaving. “I sat down at the computer and quickly created a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.” Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted right away. During the course, other students reviewed her work and encouraged her to publish it. 

With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, apart from that one story, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. It helped that her husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor. His help in editing the novel was very important. Alice says, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I believe we work well together. He improves what I write – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if something isn’t working, he suggests different words. My instinct is to keep adding more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor.”"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to take part in a special race. This race would have Jonny racing in a car on the roads, while Alistair would race on a mountain bike across the countryside. The race took place in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. 

“I’m looking forward to it,” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I’ll be warm in the car.” Alistair was also excited, but he was dressed in full winter cycling gear, unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt. “To be honest,” Alistair said, “I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.”

The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would finish at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, which is about 350 meters high. This would be easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill right at the beginning. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair quickly rode away on his bike, while Jonny got into his car and started driving. The big question was: who would reach the finish line first?

Jonny’s confidence quickly faced a challenge. Just 15 seconds into his drive, he encountered a giant tractor blocking the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman in his car. “If Alistair beats me, it’s all because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny continued driving, while Alistair struggled with the steep hill. A few miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, passing walls and fences. Sheep watched curiously as the Olympic champion carried his bike.

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. With the sun shining and open land ahead, he began to pick up speed. Meanwhile, Jonny faced another challenge. The narrow roads in the villages of Yorkshire were not made for fast driving. He had to slow down to get around a very tight corner and then drove through a stream on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he raced straight towards the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard, and then suddenly had to brake as he reached the finish line. Looking up, he asked the crowd, “Is he here?” When they said no, he raised his arms in celebration, shouting, “Yes!”

A few moments later, Jonny arrived in his car and stepped out. “Well done,” he said, feeling disappointed. “I’m gutted.”"

You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your own shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a special atmosphere that keeps you focused. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. What I find hardest in a tennis match is to block out everything except the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by loud applause and cheers when a point ends. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t realize that there are fifteen thousand people watching me closely, or that millions are watching around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach since I was young, taught me that this is the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing with my friends my dream of playing there one day and winning. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not too hard. I was just happy to have made it that far after turning twenty. Federer won easily, but my loss in 2007 was much harder. I knew I could have played better; it was not my skill that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, my tough coach, usually does not comfort me, even when I win. It shows how upset I was that he told me there was no reason to cry and that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand; I thought that was my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments are more important than others, and I had let a big one slip away in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to help me feel better. But he was right in the end. Another chance came my way. Here I was again in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat the year before; this time, my mindset would be strong. The best sign that I was ready was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family and friends the night before the final, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to mention it, but they understood that I was already focused on the match in my mind. From that moment until the match started, that focus was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: In early April 1957, a young and hopeful Englishwoman arrived in Africa. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always longed for.” Her name was Jane Goodall, and she would spend most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, the National Geographic Society helped make her famous by publishing articles and making documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including popular children’s books and the 1971 bestseller *In the Shadow of Man*, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her personal life rather than her work. She has been portrayed in many ways: as a girl seeking adventure, a privileged woman who wanted to live with wild animals, and a strong feminist in a male-dominated field. These images can undervalue her true contributions. 

Based on the number of references to her research by other scientists, the success of her students, and the data collected during her forty-year study, Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading figure in her field and the world’s top zoologist. Simply put, she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before Goodall’s work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or that they used tools, like humans. We also did not realize that chimpanzees share similar emotions with us or that their social structures are very much like ours. Goodall discovered that chimpanzee communities in Africa have their own unique cultural traditions. Her book, *The Chimpanzees of Gombe* (1986), is the most important work in chimpanzee research and serves as an encyclopedia on the subject. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals, and since chimpanzees are our closest relatives, she also changed how we view ourselves.

Even as a child, there were signs of the person Jane Goodall would become. One clear example happened in the autumn of 1939 when she was just five years old. One day, Jane disappeared, and her family called the police to help find her. After a long search, she reappeared alone, with straw in her hair and clothes. When her mother asked where she had been, Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. To find out, she had crawled into a henhouse, hidden in the straw, and stayed very still for five hours until a hen laid an egg. This moment can be seen as the start of her journey as a biologist."
34,"Text: 

In our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voice of a playful 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV shows and cartoons, as well as those who have seen training videos about health and safety. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says, “so I had to learn how to say many medical terms quickly.” 

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,” she says. “But there is more to it. You need to bring the script to life for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many well-known people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions because of their fame, but often they don’t get the roles because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”

After school, Shirley joined a drama course, hoping for a traditional acting career. During the course, she occasionally worked singing jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major role.” Shirley discovered she could do voices and thought voiceover work might be a good path for her. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”

Adult female actors are often asked to provide the voices for young boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than those of male actors, and hiring child performers involves complicated procedures and many forms, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create different sounds and to avoid always sounding like the same child. She collects new voices by watching children’s TV. 

Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,” she says. “I’ve learned that the trick is to smile while you talk – it makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; working with other actors makes a big difference.”

The competition for work is strong, and a good showreel – a recording that shows what the artist can do – is very important. “It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she has reached the top of her profession through hard work as much as talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending “specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.” She also thinks a love for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing a specific American voice, for example, it can take over me, and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days,” she says. “My children have grown up hearing their mom talk in many different voices.”"
35,"Text: ""People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is understandable because cartooning is a job many children dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually give up these childhood dreams and think about more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can earn a living by drawing simple pictures, like the doodles in school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do just that. 

People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I created a few ideas, and they bought them. In a few months, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as there are teachers. The barriers to becoming a cartoonist are low, but it is still a tough job. No one should try to become a cartoonist unless they feel they cannot do anything else. It is much easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and allows time for family, home repairs, and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better chance you have of making a living with your art. I have created political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also worked as a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I don’t refuse any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you may not want to do. It also helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But those days are fading. Today, cartooning is often an entrepreneurial activity, which means you not only have to create the work but also sell it. The more comfortable you are with this, the better you will do. I have seen cartoonists with average creativity and great business skills succeed more than those who are very talented but lack other skills.

It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon and are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried that they won’t even let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ circle it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it can actually be a lucky break!"""
36,"Text: ""Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. Among other items, I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate getting rid of old things, so why did I want to throw this one away? I took it to the dump and was about to leave it on a pile of rubbish when a young man approached me, looking confused. 'You’re not going to throw that away, are you?' he asked. I told him I was, and I started to feel regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said 'Yes.' After that, I felt sad about my decision for many years.

Then, a few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it ten years later in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I read the email from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, 'I’ve got your electric guitar.' It had been bought and sold many times since the young man at the dump took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back of the guitar. He realized it was probably old, but he used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so emotional; I would have given him anything, but his price was very fair. I had forgotten that my dad always put name-and-address stickers on my things, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this strange situation!

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. Unlike the violin, it didn’t sound bad when a beginner played it. But I struggled to improve, so I switched to the electric guitar and played easier songs. This was also the time of punk music, when people who couldn’t play well could still be rock stars. When I opened the box that Keith sent me with my old guitar, I suddenly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my smiling parents gave it to me. Holding it again felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap over my shoulder because electric guitars are played that way. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands just knew what to do. My middle-aged fingers felt the familiar pain of pressing down the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves 'The Regainers!'"""

There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book *Insomniac*, which is about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Anyone who has trouble sleeping will tell you that sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social health. Those who struggle the most with sleep often understand its importance the best. It is good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. However, I wonder about dreams. I haven’t heard much about them in this discussion. We are losing our dreams all the time. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss out on the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, the stage where we have the most dreams. Our most vivid and powerful dreams happen mainly in REM sleep just before we wake up in the morning. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, so a person who lives to be 90 years old will spend six or seven years in this stage. When researchers prevent people from having REM sleep, they find that the next night, people have more REM sleep to make up for it. This suggests that dreams serve a purpose. 

When researchers discovered REM sleep in 1953, many agreed with the famous psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was the best way to understand our minds. However, later research did not support this idea. The focus of dream studies shifted from psychological reasons to physical ones. Currently, there is very little agreement among dream researchers, according to Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. 

Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study that found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams much better than others. He concluded that the use of dreams increases with a person’s interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as film is very dream-like. But I wondered, are only creative people the ones who benefit from their dreams? Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? 

Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to create new associations. Dreams may help us discover new patterns and combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They “ignore the obvious and connect things in unexpected ways... This is what creativity is,” says Stickgold. 

I find that I write better when I wake up from intense dreams. Even a difficult dream, or one I can barely remember, seems to give me ideas and inspiration. On those days, words and images come to me so quickly that I can hardly keep up with typing. I don’t know how it works, but it does seem to help. However, creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and we all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why dreaming is important."

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see a beautiful view of the sea and many empty frames on the walls, along with smiling photos of her two daughters. Susie is a well-known copyist artist, able to recreate famous paintings from the early 20th century and the 16th century. It seems strange that she doesn’t keep any of her own work. “I don’t have any of my own around,” Susie says with a shrug. “As soon as I finish them, they go.” 

Susie is in high demand. Over her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted works by many great artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings can sell for millions, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she spends on them. Susie does not reveal most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but others care more about status. One famous buyer likes to show off his “Van Gogh” painting, which is actually a “Susie Ray Van Gogh.” “Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors keep the original in a bank safe and display Susie’s copy to save on insurance.

Susie is honest about her work. When she copies an old masterpiece, she tries to make it look as real as possible because she believes it is important to respect the original artist. However, she signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as the real thing is illegal, and even though she knows people who have done that, she has never been tempted. Those who make fakes often get into trouble. Susie points out that she isn’t rich and has faced challenges, but her situation is better now, and she doesn’t want to risk her reputation.

Susie didn’t always work as a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden for several years, earning very little money. Looking back, she sees that this experience helped her develop her skills and gave her a love for plants, even though it was hard to live on that income. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets about that job but is happy to have found something more financially rewarding.

When younger artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and represent things accurately. She emphasizes how much she has studied to do her work. Her training allows her to draw plants, make perfect copies of 15th-century paintings, and reproduce 20th-century abstract art, but she now focuses on French impressionists, especially Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 

Susie believes that many people think modern art is easy, almost like children’s art. However, she explains that impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very careful. This combination is harder to achieve than people think. Given her skills, it seems unusual that Susie doesn’t create her own art. Isn’t art about expressing yourself? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She explains that her work is the result of years of training, and she makes a good living from it. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs—fine, but not special. It’s like living on simple food after enjoying meals from a top chef. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"Text: 'During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur cared most about the sea and being the fastest person on it. This passion started in her childhood. She had a special connection with the boats that took her around the world; they felt like one with her. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant. People wanted to know about her races, but she quickly wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that had almost defeated her. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me the small, stuffy cabin of her boat, Kingfisher. This was her home, workplace, and survival space for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was key for her. She proudly displayed her unappealing stock of foil-wrapped, freeze-dried food, a tiny gas stove, and organized medical supplies. Her care for the boat was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it. Now, she views the world as a boat: a small, beautiful, and fragile thing with limited resources. 

Her turning point came during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. This experience made her reflect and see things differently. The many abandoned whaling stations served as a warning to her. She felt that humans often take what they want and move on without thinking. When I arrived at Ellen’s office, she was finishing a heated conference call. She then explained why we must act now to save the planet. 'We are not making coal, oil, or gas anymore. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways to not waste them. At first, my message was negative – to use less – but I realized there is a better way to think about it.' Now, she focuses on re-using materials, passionately discussing things like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the past three years, she has been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. 'I will never be an expert,' she says. 'But I am like a sponge. I love learning. The current situation is something I cannot ignore. Compared to sailing, this feels less selfish. It’s about finding how my voice can be most helpful. It really matters.' She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and schools to help young people imagine and create a sustainable future. 'I do miss the adventure of being at sea,' she says. 'It defines who I am. You feel connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on records, practical matters, and survival. My new message is not as simple as saying: “I’m going to be the fastest around the world.” I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I’ve ever done.'"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his time. He hopes to inspire other kids to go outside and explore, instead of just playing on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves ""Team Romero."" Climbing Everest is just part of their plan. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Very few people achieve this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he becomes a teenager.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the highest mountain in the world. They agreed that a young climber might be strong enough physically, but they were not sure if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also questioned whether a young person could have enough experience to make good decisions and react quickly while climbing safely.

The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know there is criticism, but I can’t focus on it – we have a lot to do. I think about possible problems, of course. Karen and I always consider the risks, but we believe our experience as climbers will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""

I also wonder about Jordan’s reasons for wanting to climb. Is this just a father pushing his son to take risks? Paul insists, ""This project isn’t about me wanting to be famous through my son’s achievements. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided: ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.""

When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal."" In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting event. The more exciting the record, the more attention it gets. This creates a problem for Jordan. While some people say that focusing on achievements can take away the fun, if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He has to do something amazing, like climbing Everest.

Paul adds, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will end this project and go to the gym."""

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they usually don’t know who he is. I just started a music degree, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other people our age. If you don’t know who created the music, you probably don’t own any of their recordings. This is sad for fans of classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only about 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. 

So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who enjoy classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I like many styles, but according to what’s on my computer, I listen to classical music about as much as that 3% figure suggests.

Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many changes, can be hard for us. We like to talk, play, and think quickly. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while understanding classical music takes time and focus. Also, pop music often talks about things that interest teenagers, while classical music usually does not.

The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more middle-aged people enjoy classical concerts, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.

Some people say that schools are to blame for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it’s not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,” she said with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the other side, so she didn’t hear, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… “Riding centre,” Bonnie said, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” her mother replied. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,” Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do so. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she thought. “I’ll be thrown out soon anyway, so why not get it over with?” She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a large area for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one in sight. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, and she could see that right away. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, looking carefully at each horse. “I know what you’re doing here,” she said to a small pony, gently touching its nose. The next horse made her stop. “But aren’t you the best of the lot!” she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, which Bonnie liked. “You know, I feel like we’ve met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “It was in my dreams, and I was riding you to victory in a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle. It can’t be far.” Bonnie was happy to find that the room with the riding equipment was unlocked. While she was busy putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she could see. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,” she said with admiration. “I’m not joking because I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else.” She nudged him into a walk, then into a trot. “If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,” she said. She went around and around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, with a little breeze brushing past her cheek. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,"Text: 'I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up on stage in front of thousands of fans? “I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven,” Cody says, remembering how it all began. “But I was swimming and surfing every day. Those activities were more important to me back then; I had a busy life. When I was 13 and in high school, I posted a few videos online.” These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans left comments asking for more videos on their social media. So Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The responses were amazing. Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on his sport. But then record labels contacted him, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the chance. “It was very hard for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 years old and trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. “It surprised most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,” he says, remembering their shocked faces. “I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to stay that way in this crazy world.” So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family across the world, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and is not directly involved in his career, they support him from behind the scenes. Cody says it’s important to have a close group of good people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, everyone has doubts. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old, and he’s traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a normal life,” Cody admits. “I worry about how that affects him, but my family always reassures me that they support me in everything I do.” Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big opportunity, even when it’s a little scary. “It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I’m going to countries I never thought I’d visit and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s something many people dream of. But I know it won’t last forever.”'"

I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sunlight. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags into place. Last week, I had worked with most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing that I could do the job. My grandfather didn’t pay much attention to this. 

With one hand still on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of dark water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on either side, and solid ice further downstream. As I took off my pajamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t recognize him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. This chain is more special to me than having a famous grandfather, and only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have the diary he kept on that trip, which I read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen. 

“Good morning, Rex,” my mom smiled as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his bedroom. 

“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was obvious from my wetsuit, and he had seen me in my kayak every morning. I tried to ignore his anger, but it was getting harder. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hit me hard, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came over with a sympathetic smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I didn’t say that he had always been like this. But like my mom, I tried to be understanding. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me photos of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own collection of trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. 

My mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even on these cold days!” 

I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my expedition.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Text: 'Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her into the study, where on the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s works, but it looked different from his usual style and was obviously unfinished. “Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” 

Jess looked closely at the painting. There was a river that took up most of the picture; it was not a river she recognized and maybe it wasn’t real at all, just a made-up river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was very small, with just a hint of green that was easy to miss, drawing the eye into the pale waters and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, no birds, and no people; it felt right that way. There seemed to be no place for living things in this distant scene. Yet for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking about autumn coming after a long summer.

Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written there. Jess read them aloud: “River Boy.” The words felt strangely important to her, but she didn’t know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” 

“Exactly. Strange, isn’t it? For him to be so specific. But he hasn’t finished it yet, so maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” 

“Mum! You should have known better.” 

“I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess his response.” 

Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. “He told you it’s not the artist’s job to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, just like a poem, and we either understand it or we don’t. He said painting is hard enough work without having to explain it to everyone…” 

“‘Ignoramus,’ he said.” 

“… every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to every Tom, Dick, and Harry, they’d never get any work done. And he said…” Mum interrupted her, laughing. “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.” 

“Inspire?” 

“Someone who gives an artist ideas.” Jess knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he usually said it to mean that the muse wasn’t helping him that day or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a hard part to work on. He never suggested that the muse was about her. In fact, she always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a real person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. “He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He’s been painting all his life.”'"
46,"Text: 'When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the edge of the bed while holding Dad’s Stanley knife, the blade might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I’m not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn’t mean to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up thinking, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me quite often. I’m a bit unlucky in that way.

What I was really doing was trying to find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved from her house to a flat. It’s very cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in there, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones in it. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet, and I was so happy when she gave it to me!

The problem is, it is a corner cabinet, which means it has to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one that is the size of a broom cupboard is mine. Mum says that when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. And when Tom goes to university, I can choose any room. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be stuck in my broom cupboard for a long time. I don’t really mind; I quite like my little bedroom. It’s cozy, like a nest. I love the way the roof slopes down and the window is at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. 

I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. Then I thought, if I can’t cut anything off Gran’s cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box.’ And that was exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"Text: 'The novel ‘The Borrowers’ tells the story of a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They “borrow” things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be difficult to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn’t want to be criticized for getting it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans', which made filming more complicated. 

The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be ten times further away than usual. When filming the human world around the Borrowers, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to show the Borrowers' perspective. They went through many pairs of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. 

One big challenge was to create the right shadows when combining the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US director George Lucas called to ask how we did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with large objects to make the actors look small. It was very surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins being bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much. 

In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t need to act. One important thing for me was getting the costumes right, which other directors have struggled with in past versions. I had the costumes made from heavy canvas so they looked like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the leading actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor’s trousers were made from a rug because normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they appreciated my attention to detail with the costumes! 

Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home had to be filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I made 2,000 drawings by the end. They weren’t perfect, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I spent three months working at night. We had to work quickly – I once filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But in the end, everything came together, and I think the series was successful in capturing the magic of the books.'"

I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones asking for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything’s going to be fine,” I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone in this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to escape my old life on the road with tour tutors. While the rest of the band is renting here for recording, we are staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet real kids. How about a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns? That would be so cool. 

I walk into the school’s main office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I tell the school secretary. “Name?” She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. The secretary seems confused. “Oh,” she says and types “McGraw” on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad uses his stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” the secretary says. Then she rips the sheet and hands it to me. English Literature, first period. Great, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly searching for my classes. 

When I get to the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” She continues while I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my very normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with tan flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses in the attendance. “Desert... McGraw?” she says carefully. “Here.” The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize! All teachers should understand how important this is. 

“So why did you move here?” my new friend asks. I have a few choices. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a recording studio close to the sand? “My dad had to move,” I tell her. Yes, lies work better. “What does he do?” she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” And she doesn’t seem to care. Great.'"

Today, American teenage girls are expected to do a lot. They should be the president of the Student Council, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in school. Being an average teenager is not enough anymore. Many people think that if teenagers do not have big goals, they are being lazy. 

Kristen Loose, a teenager, says, ""Adults often forget how much pressure we have. We have a lot of homework, tests, activities, jobs, chores, and we also want to have a social life."" Even with all this stress, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist. Some people think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and only care about themselves. While some teenagers may fit these stereotypes, Kristen believes it is unfair to label all teenagers this way. 

Kristen admits she often has her cellphone nearby, but she uses it for important things, not just for fun. Teenagers use their phones to make their lives easier. They are expected to have quick access to information and to be reachable all the time, which can look like an addiction to their phones. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their homework anywhere. Instead of just listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons. Schoolwork now requires attention all day and night, which can be tiring for teenagers. 

Many teenagers wake up around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often stay up past midnight. Their days are filled with school, activities, family responsibilities, and homework. They usually get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teenagers get enough sleep. Additionally, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are too tired. 

Lindamarie Olsen, another teenager, thinks she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. She does not spend her free time on social media or watching TV. Instead, she focuses on volunteering. Lindamarie says, ""People think teenagers only care about themselves, but I love volunteering. I want to make a positive impact in my school and community."" 

In the future, the stereotypes about teenagers may change, but they will continue to challenge these ideas and make a difference in the world. There will always be new generations of students who are making an impact before they even finish school."

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, surrounded by wilderness, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, this small group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project that combines astronomy and adventure, which is likely why teenagers want to join. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and creates a bright trail of light.

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box were a camera, a device to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check the temperature as the balloon rose. Two GPS trackers were placed on the outside of the lunch box to help the group find it later. They used a gas tank, donated by a supporter from a nearby state, to inflate the balloon, which slowly grew to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour round trip to get the gas tank. “I didn’t really mind,” he said. For kids in this club, that’s normal.

Finally, it was time for lift-off. “Five, four, three, two, one,” they counted down, and the balloon began to rise. Some of them ran and followed its path with powerful flashlights until they could no longer see it in the dark sky. There was a quiet moment filled with wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at a sky so clear that it was hard to believe they were only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with around 4 million people. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” said one girl quietly. “I know,” whispered another. A meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, and the balloon expanded until it was almost the size of a house. Then it popped with a loud noise. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recoveries are a big part of the program,” said the group’s leader, noting they have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.”

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. “These students are familiar with the Eastern Sierra,” their leader said. “What seems wild and dangerous to some is just a way of life for others.” In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not record any shooting stars. While this was a bit disappointing, it was also a chance to discuss the effects of atmospheric waves and how they might work above mountains. And it was one more adventure story to share with anyone who asked."
51,"Text: Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, did not interest her much until she was fifteen. It happened by chance when her younger brother was excited about dinosaurs, a phase many children go through. She had not experienced this interest herself and often dismissed it. However, when she helped him with a science project and read an article about recent discoveries, she was amazed and realized she wanted to pursue this field.

Chloe recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite being young. She was nervous at first, worried he might think she was just an annoying kid with questions. However, she felt more comfortable when he showed patience and listened to her.

I ask Chloe about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. She thinks that films like Jurassic Park, which use special effects to create dinosaurs, have increased public interest in these creatures, but not necessarily in Palaeontology itself. She finds it frustrating that palaeontologists are often portrayed as either strange geniuses or socially awkward people. She believes these portrayals do not reflect the reality of their work.

Chloe explains that her job is very varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in laboratories to analyze fossils, and writing for scientific publications. Although it is not always part of her job, she also tries to communicate scientific findings to the public. She believes it is important to help young people understand science, as talking about dinosaurs can inspire them to learn more about the natural world and other scientific topics.

The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs gave Chloe a chance to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She notes that the creators of the program were knowledgeable, and she only needed to provide advice occasionally. Most of her work involved ensuring that the dinosaurs shown lived during the same time period. The program attracted viewers of all ages because it presented dinosaurs in a way that was very different from movies like Jurassic Park, making them appear more realistic.

Chloe thinks dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they connect to our natural curiosity and desire to explore. They remind us that there is still much to discover in the world, and Palaeontology allows us to travel back in time."
52,"Text: ""I will say this once: when you are traveling by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not ‘there yet,’ even when you keep asking ‘Are we there yet?’ The truth is, once you arrive, it’s not ‘there’ anymore; it’s ‘here.’ So if you think you might be ‘there’ already, you should ask ‘Are we here yet?’ I’m sure no one wishes to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear that question over and over on long car trips. 

Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with no responsibilities? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles you haven’t finished, while the beautiful scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, there’s mum or dad, who gives out juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio station, and keeps everything running smoothly. 

But then, someone in the car does something annoying – usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let that happen, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, he’s all over my space, and a fight starts. The driver and co-pilot have to reach back and separate us while the car swerves. They tell Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a bit, and we can enjoy the beautiful views again.

Later, I try to read, but I feel a draft on my arm. The window isn’t open, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He’s not touching me, so he thinks he’s being clever. This makes me angry. Tim gets yelled at again, and the car swerves more. Eventually, things calm down again.

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask ‘Are we there yet?’ he often says, ‘Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.’ But we are still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour. Then he says, ‘Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.’ This keeps us quiet for a while. 

You can tell when you finally arrive because the adults jump out of the car and move as far away from us as possible after all those hours. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You’re not there yet."""

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee and cake while playing board games. They hope that customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a space where people can connect without staring at screens. She believes that people naturally want to be together and talk to each other.

The games played in their café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games often have gentle themes, like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other, keeping everyone engaged until the end. This idea was improved in ‘co-operative’ games, where all players work together to win or lose as a team, which encourages more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, created by North American designer Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on the book of the same name. He remembers feeling scared and excited while playing it with friends, and he wanted to create a game that gave players a similar experience.

Leacock has loved board games since he was a child, but he often felt disappointed when games did not meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he started redesigning games to make them better. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up game included a lot of storytelling. Leacock explains that it is similar to video games because players develop characters, learn new rules, and the story changes as they play.

The growth of the video game industry has helped the popularity of modern board games. Many people now play games on their smartphones, making them more open to playing board games. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone is a mobile gamer now. 

For a while, video games allowed some social interaction, like playing together in arcades or on the couch. However, as multiplayer games moved online, players became more distant from each other. This led some people to seek out board games to play with others in person. In John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming has become more than just fun. In our online world, games are now something to share directly with others, and this trend is likely to continue."

Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest hits in the UK in recent years. His story shows that endurance and persistence are very important in the music business, even if your career starts with many failures. He says his mother was ‘an amazing singer’ who helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio he listened to at home was a local station for older people, which explains some of his early influences. He was 12 years old when he first heard a modern song. Around the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he did at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the music room at school learning songs on the piano. He said, ‘I was doing well in tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for my whole life. It was just too much hard work.’

At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not share his passion for performing. Jamie remembers going to his parents and telling them he wanted to pursue music. He had been writing lyrics during economics lessons and playing the piano every day while others were outside playing. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed; if he didn’t, he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Eventually, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a record label in the UK, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. However, fame and fortune did not come easily. He said, ‘I feel like I’ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time for most of my career, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.’ Writing for other artists is where he really found success. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels turn to for new artists. He helps launch their careers.

Sometimes, he has to explain to the artists he works with that wanting to write popular songs is not something to be ashamed of. He asks them, ‘Why don’t you want to? Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?’ He believes they should aim to create something amazing that will also sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone in pop music speak openly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he simply knows he wants to write number one songs and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his work. He says, ‘When I go into the studio with someone, we need to aim for the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.’"

Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very popular online, but many people, like me, may not know him because we don’t watch videos of people doing tricks on bikes. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from difficult places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other hard spots. These jumps are filmed and shared online.

On the day I interview him, we meet in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids know who he is, and some older people come to tell him he’s “an absolute legend.” After watching him perform, I agree with them. At first, I was unsure about him, but I am impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, he explains what he plans to do, and sometimes I can’t believe he will succeed. When I compliment him, he seems uninterested and a bit sad. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He says, “I find the social side of it difficult. I see the value of being in touch with fans, but I prefer to actually do things instead of just talking about them.” This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and the small cameras that help create this content. He says, “This technology allows people like me to earn money.” Sometimes he feels like everyone is filming themselves or looking at screens, and he doesn’t always agree with that.

However, he is not complaining. Through his videos, he makes a good living from what used to be just a hobby. After many years of interviewing top athletes, I have learned that two important things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These qualities can be more important than talent and help someone keep going even after failure. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength is needed. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy but new challenges. He just got back up and kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He says, “People who say this may care, but they don’t understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and don’t know much about the sport. They don’t realize I get advice from experts to reduce the risks.” In reality, Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, “People are different. Some never feel scared, and they shouldn’t do these sports. It’s smart to know the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those who can overcome fear and those who cannot. I am in the group that feels fear but finds a way to move past it. I’m not addicted to risk; I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes I ride around for a while to get ready before trying a new jump. I know I must stay calm just before I jump. If I fully commit, then I’m fine.”"

For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, just a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found out that high-wire walking was very different. ‘The training was a shock,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and then another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could keep going. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterwards. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ However, this experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"

He had already written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He loved motorsport and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and also used it for a holiday in Amsterdam. He said, “That trip opened my eyes. I decided to see the world by bike.” Jeff did not want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. He thought the most unusual bike would be a penny farthing, so he visited a museum to learn how they were made. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally began his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. He met cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he never regretted using his penny farthing. The further he traveled from home, the more surprised people were by it. His worst experience was having to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to return home. Despite everything, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”"

We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we know very little about their nighttime activities because we did not have the right equipment. This new scope will give us clear images, even on nights without a moon, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat. 

It is hard work. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some locations and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has not been helpful – some nights are warm, but most of the time it is rainy. It is so quiet that I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one working day because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to the summer when we will spend hours in a laboratory looking at our results together.

She says her course is popular because it includes many skills, such as juggling, throwing and catching balls, and even fire, as well as trapeze, where performers fly through the air in front of an amazed audience. 

In the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Staying fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is essential, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and never stop improving their skills. 

People often think that circus performers are likely to get injured or that they only work for a short time each year. However, the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, though, that it’s not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not provide a regular salary. It’s also competitive – but a lot of fun!”'"

“What I love about my job is that when I walk into the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might be a funny little song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what the producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater!

I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, along with an orchestra. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough as it is.”

But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Text: 'Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Even though her parents were not musicians, there was always music in their home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. This teacher suggested that joining the school theatre club might help her feel more confident. After being in the club for a while, she happily sang with 50 other students at a concert at the end of the term. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she signed up for a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many of the others. However, Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, and she wrote a song called Something to Say about how this made her feel. She shared this song online, and it became very popular. She was happy when people left comments saying they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask her to join his company. At first, she was unsure because she did not know anything about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her that this would not happen, and soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. They sold all the tickets quickly, and it was an amazing night. Ana says she is less interested in writing songs about happy times; when life is difficult, she has more to express. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes her fans will enjoy her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her.'"
65,"Text: 'Last year, I went on an amazing trip – a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit this area since I saw it on TV as a child, especially because our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally agreed! A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. Luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was good. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry promised he would take care of everything, so I stopped worrying. 

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide said that very few people live along that coast, and indeed, the only other living creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was nice to forget about how fast or slow the day was going. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all cooked together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life! When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew if I stayed, I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!'"
66,"Text: ""My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to many of his games. You might think that watching so many matches would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed, and a few weeks later, I played against a team from another school. My parents came to watch, which made me more nervous, but it turned out fine!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I hadn’t spent much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part wasn’t a big change for me. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to match my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""
67,"Text: ""Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I trained to be a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This meant taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed giving those tours. I got to see the city I had lived in my whole life from the perspective of tourists, and it felt like a new experience every time! After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I researched what I needed to do, I found out that to get a license as a full-time tour guide, I had to know much more than I had learned so far. All Chicago guides must be able to answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. 

Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. There are many other important skills. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and most importantly, you need to react to changing situations. For example, if a place you thought was open is actually closed when you arrive, or if a route changes. Tourists do not want to hear about problems or that they are missing something; they just want to enjoy a well-organized tour. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours; otherwise, they might leave a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know that these reviews are very important because good reviews attract more customers. That is why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. For me, the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job mean that my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."""
68,"Text: 'My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we have a good relationship. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we had nothing to worry about. One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their food made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found that very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants! The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. We chose to do this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not include meat, which neither of us likes. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I think she might be a little annoyed with herself for not enjoying her time there fully because she missed her friends too much. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I definitely will!'"
69,"Text: ""My name is Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not just to people for their homes or as gifts; we have many different customers. Hotels and offices often use flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we accomplished. 

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I’m a bit crazy, but I love what I do. It can be cold and dark, but I don’t let that bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were buying for myself, I would probably choose only pink flowers because it’s my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like may not be what my customers want. 

Sometimes, I can’t find the flowers that customers want because not all flowers are available all year. I don’t enjoy arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price I can. 

Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then we create flower arrangements and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by how much they cost, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the budget someone has. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things – I wouldn’t want any other job!"""
70,"Text: ""My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films and many films for kids on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I realized something was missing – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema for our films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs – we don’t want to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier for us, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We can also see how many tickets we’ve sold online, so we don’t worry about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us at the end how much they enjoyed it, it feels great. Our website has helped us connect with other film clubs across the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We started a blog because we know most people look online for film information instead of reading local papers. We also put up a few posters in cafés. However, nothing is as effective as word of mouth – people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""
71,"Text: ""Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, so I decided to start a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that many people liked my way of seeing and photographing things. I also enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better, and I agreed. So I started to focus more on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what many other young photographers were doing, as they were taking color photos. Because of this, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up. In the end, I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age, so I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget the moment when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good, and that I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I have never regretted my career choice."""
72,"Text: ""I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are levels from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you finish each level, you receive a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became much more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I finished the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to keep volunteering at the club because I had built good relationships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it. 

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job or youth work before starting at the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I now have several NYC certificates, and one of them is for camping!"""
73,"Text: ""I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to ask him if I could start, but he loved snowboarding and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly fell in love with the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for competing and winning has grown as I’ve gotten older, which helps me push myself more. I like not having a strict plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I actually started. That achievement made me trust my abilities more. 

In the summer, I focus on training and my studies when there’s no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like I do in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends then. It helps me deal with not being able to do what I love and what I’m good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I also think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is possible if my active life allows time for college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."""

I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try that. I never thought I would find it so easy, as it looked complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited about it. My mum showed me that I could create something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to my friends and family as soon as I finished making them. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. Even though I was happy they bought them, I still needed to know if they looked good enough for other people. The only way to find out was to rent a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my items to take home. Soon, we started getting calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but we were just two people at a market stall! That was when I realized it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I’ve made a lot of money through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far."""
75,"Text: 'When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview about her book, Janine said, “Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the only new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, fits in at a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.” 

Janine started her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to write. The year before, she entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was in bookshops. 

One review of Being Amelia mentions that, even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the characters face some difficult challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer says that even though Janine is still very young and Being Amelia isn’t a long novel, she has shown that she is a better writer than many other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: “At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that if I spend time with my friends, I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!”'"

This happened because my father was invited to be the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy about this opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our warm home across the water, and there was no school there. However, once we moved, we quickly got used to living on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. In the summer, the island feels friendly because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, and there are not many teenagers among them, which I had hoped for. The adults help each other and work together on repairs around the island, which can be hard work. 

The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I looked forward to going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. So when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! But we often see amazing views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then a few hours later, it can be bright and sunny again. This still feels incredible, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do have terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe.

77,"Text: 'I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different bird species apart and where to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am almost there. On family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries, too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I would see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, though, because I have learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before I walked onto the stage. I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another presentation next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.'"

I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I was surprised at first because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked my skills, and I started training regularly with a big club when I was 13 years old. I improved a lot after that. Still, some people were not sure I would become a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I thought I would! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want to let my teammates down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal. Even with a large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to meet other players from my club. It will show them what a professional environment is like and encourage them to believe they can play for a top team if they work hard.

79,"Text: 'In recent years, one of the most interesting changes in education in the UK and around the world has been the push to get new students involved in research as early as possible. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists who are discovering new things in fields like medicine. Instead, research is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. The skills you learn from research will help you not only in your studies but also in your future jobs, as they teach you how to think about the world and how to approach your work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say; you create new knowledge. Creating knowledge starts with asking questions instead of just accepting things as they are. You might wonder: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? How does it work in this situation? What should we think about the facts, opinions, or beliefs we are given? Why is this important? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to significant changes and new knowledge. However, research can also start from simple questions and everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questioning about issues, practices, and events. Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have likely done research for school projects or answered questions at work since you started. You have asked questions that led you to investigate topics, whether it was about planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training a pet, finding the right music system, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, it is expected that you will have a curious mind, identify problems and questions, critically explore and evaluate information, and create your own responses and knowledge to contribute to discussions. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed, and learning comes from listening to teachers and texts. It might feel disrespectful to question established knowledge or authority, and you may think you should be told what is important to learn. However, in higher education in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.

This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem overwhelming. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research done by others is valuable for students, academics, and professionals, but we need to engage with it, think critically, and test it. We should not just accept everything we read as true; instead, we must analyze whether the information is logical, well-reasoned, and supported by evidence. We should avoid blindly trusting the facts and information we receive from others.'"
80,"Text: 'Cities have always been important places for ideas and creativity. In the 18th century, coffee houses in London were popular spots where people discussed science and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artist Pablo Picasso talked about new art. However, living in a city can be difficult. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Today, cities are known for their creativity, but they can also feel unnatural and overwhelming.

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. While it has been known that city life can be tiring, new research shows that living in cities can actually make us think less clearly. One major reason for this is the lack of nature in urban areas. Studies have shown that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains because they give us a break from the busy city life.

This research comes at a time when more people than ever are living in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into concrete areas, surrounded by many strangers. It has become clear that these crowded environments can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. For example, when walking down a busy street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people walking, busy traffic, and confusing street layouts. These small tasks can tire us out because cities are full of distractions that require us to constantly shift our focus. This process of deciding what to pay attention to takes a lot of mental energy.

In contrast, natural environments do not require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our attention. Natural settings have things that naturally attract our focus but do not cause stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. In nature, our minds can relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the negative effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban areas. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a break from city life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people have tried many methods to boost brain performance, such as energy drinks or changing office designs, nothing seems to work as well as simply walking in nature.

Given the many mental challenges caused by city life, we must ask: Why do cities keep growing? And why do they remain centers of creativity, even in the digital age? Recent research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same crowded features of cities that can hurt our attention and memory—like busy streets and close contact with many people—are also linked to innovation. Scientists believe that the ‘concentration of social interactions’ is key to urban creativity. Just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, helps it thrive as a center for technology. On the other hand, less crowded areas may produce fewer new ideas over time. 

The challenge is to find ways to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its unique advantages. Because, as the saying goes, there will always be a moment when someone says: ‘I’m tired of nature; take me to the city!’'"
81,"**Simplified Text:**

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to support this idea. However, I believe that studying the mind should not be limited to just what is inside our bodies. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as our brain cells, play a role in how we think. 

From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have all been important in human evolution and the development of our minds. Therefore, I suggest that what is outside our heads can also be part of our minds. It is easy to see why people connect the mind with the brain. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their surroundings. This makes sense for neuroscientists who use brain scans, but it often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. 

I do not want to deny the importance of the brain in thinking, but I want to highlight that the mind is more than just the brain. It is more useful to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects can help us think and how they become part of our bodies, like when we use clay to make numbers or use a stone to create a tool. It also examines how these interactions have changed over time and what those changes mean for our thinking.

This approach gives us new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of the role of objects in thinking. For example, think of a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be linked, and it illustrates the flexibility of the human mind. By using the stick, the blind person can turn touch into a form of sight, and the stick becomes part of their body in a way. 

The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can change significantly by using new technologies. I see the human mind as a work in progress, always evolving. It is important to remember that, no matter what form the “stick” has taken throughout history—whether it is a simple stone tool or a modern smartphone—its main purpose is to connect us to the world. 

Through the “stick,” humans explore and understand their environment, and they also find new ways to move forward. This is different from how monkeys use sticks to get food. For humans, “sticks” help us satisfy our curiosity. This special ability to engage with material culture explains why humans create things more than any other species, and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as we interact with the material world. I want to emphasize the importance of material objects in understanding the mind. MET provides a new way to see how different types of material culture, from ancient tools to modern technology, have influenced who we are and how we think. While the idea of technology changing our minds may sound futuristic, humans have been using it since the beginning of our existence."

This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture at all levels – from practical and scientific uses to industrial and artistic ones, as well as a new world of entertainment that came with the camera. Historians say that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the United States to the visual arts. In no other art form has American work been so significant. This is a bold statement, but it shows how photography has become central to American thought and art. To fully appreciate its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century. 

Why was this new art so attractive? First, photography was a mechanical process that matched a growing interest in technology, reflecting a national attitude that accepted change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made communication and travel easier, photography brought the wonders of the world into homes in a stunning way. Second, the camera became the preferred tool for expressing identity, allowing people to create images for public viewing in a country where personal and national identities were always being formed and reformed. Third, the camera has been very important for families, providing a way to keep a record of their lives, even if that record is somewhat idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the trend towards realism in American art, which focused on everyday life.

Every photograph draws attention to something specific, showing what the photographer wants us to see. The fact that a photograph is made by a machine, rather than drawn by hand, gives it a unique quality: photographs are records of events, people, and things; they show at least what was in front of the camera, giving them a sense of objectivity. However, because each photograph is taken by a specific person, it also carries a personal point of view. We might look at a photograph and think we understand its meaning, especially if we recognize the subject. This is why photography has often been called a ‘universal language’. But the meaning of a photograph is more complicated than that. 

Few things in front of us – whether a person, object, or event – have their own meaning. No image is presented to us without some context that shapes our understanding of it, such as a caption in a newspaper, a layout in a magazine, or its position in a gallery or book. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and role in its culture: Why did the photographer take the picture? How did people first see it? Additionally, the same image might be viewed in different places and times, and its meaning would change accordingly.

For a long time, the importance of the camera to artists was not widely recognized, but today it is well understood. In recent decades, starting with U.S. artist Andy Warhol’s use of photographs in his paintings and silk screens, artists have been including photographs in their work in many ways. In summary, photographic vision has become an essential part of painting in art history, not something separate from it."""
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. Everyone has a mental life, so we have some understanding of what this means. Although we can study mental life in rats, monkeys, and humans, it is still a complex idea. James focused mainly on human psychology, which he believed included basic elements like thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is mostly personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not be influenced by scientific facts.

Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions on complicated psychological topics, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. Problems can arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in different situations. Psychologists help us separate subjective thoughts, which can be biased, from objective facts.

Psychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind and brain. While psychologists study the brain, they do not yet fully understand how it works in relation to our feelings, hopes, and behaviors. It is often difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not easily observable. We can only understand them indirectly through behavior.

Studying psychology is similar to solving a crossword puzzle. It requires evaluating and interpreting clues, which must come from careful observation and accurate measurement. These observations need to be analyzed rigorously and interpreted logically. Psychology often involves complex interactions, and understanding them requires advanced techniques and theories. Like any other science, psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to influence the processes it studies. When these goals are met, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply this knowledge to improve people's lives.

Psychological research has been useful in many areas, such as improving teaching methods, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been studied scientifically for the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to answer psychological questions. They aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today. However, introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only allows us to see a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than on their own experiences."

In a storehouse in a regular business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place that shows the failures of consumer products – the opposite of the positive, success-focused world of modern marketing. Here, you can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were not popular. This collection, owned by a company called GfK, is informally known as the Museum of Failed Products. It displays products that were taken off the market because very few people wanted to buy them. The owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own sad story involving designers, marketers, and salespeople.

What is most surprising about this museum is that it exists as a successful business. You might think that any good manufacturer would keep a collection of their failed products. However, the executives who visit the museum show that this is not common. They often avoid thinking about their failures and do not keep samples of their unsuccessful products. The museum itself started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, wanted to create a ‘reference library’ of consumer products, not just failed ones. Starting in the 1960s, he began buying samples of every new item he could find. He did not realize that most products fail. By collecting new products without discrimination, he ended up with mostly unsuccessful ones.

Today’s culture of optimism may explain why many products ended up in the museum. Each product likely went through meetings where no one noticed it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might invest more money into a failing product to try to save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and everyone involved may choose to forget about it.

This focus on optimism is especially strong in the growing ‘self-help’ industry. A common idea here is ‘positive visualization’: if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to happen. Some researchers believe that our ability to see the positive side is so important for survival that it has become part of our nature. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot has found that a healthy mind may be designed to see good outcomes as more likely than they really are. Her research suggests that well-balanced people often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events, unlike those who are depressed.

But how effective are these ‘positive fantasies about the future’? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied this question. Their findings are surprising: spending time thinking about how well things could go can actually reduce most people’s motivation to reach their goals. For example, groups of people who were encouraged to imagine having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck believes that our experiences with failure depend on our beliefs about ability. Dweck says that people with a ‘fixed mindset’ think ability is something you are born with, while those with a ‘growth mindset’ believe it can develop through effort and challenges. People with a fixed mindset find failure very scary because it shows they did not meet expectations. For example, a sports star who thinks of himself as a ‘natural’ may not practice enough and fail to reach his potential. On the other hand, people with a growth mindset see failure as a sign that they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles grow stronger when they are pushed to their limits, where they tear and heal. The deeper message is that having a growth mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are making us rethink home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. At the same time, those who invest in sports want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid enough, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some of their home games in the Far East to reach more fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. This belief may lead them to confuse cause and effect. When a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans often remember that when they cheered, a goal was scored, but they forget the many times when their cheering did not lead to success.

However, there is one common belief among fans that is supported by scientific evidence. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct a lot of their noise at the referee. In a well-known experiment, referees watched a match with crowd noise and another group watched the same match in silence. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team than those who watched in silence. Interestingly, the crowd noise did not make them more likely to call fouls against the away team. The researchers found that referees try to avoid extra stress from making calls against the home team. They do not simply do what the crowd wants; they try to avoid making the crowd angry.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. One reason for this change may be travel. In the past, travel was difficult, but now football players travel in great comfort, and if their hotel is not good enough, someone from the club will find them a better one. Local conditions used to be very different, but now top stadiums are becoming more similar in their efficiency.

Despite these explanations, none fully explains the data. These changes, like pampered players and similar stadiums, have happened in the last decade or two. The mystery remains why home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. One reason could be that home advantage is more about teamwork, and in baseball, the focus is more on individual matchups between the batter and pitcher. Team sports require coordination among teammates. In basketball, winning depends on everyone working together, which builds confidence when playing at home, regardless of the playing conditions.

Another possibility relates to a more aggressive side of sports. Researchers found that players’ testosterone levels were normal before training and away games, but increased by up to 67% before home games. This feeling of defending their home may connect to a basic instinct to protect their territory, as seen in the recent Rugby World Cup. In two important games, the underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing determination and a refusal to be intimidated—this is a sign of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is appreciated by many athletes and their coaches. The reason is clear. First, there is debate about who originally said it, with many other golfers from that time being suggested. Second, the meaning is not straightforward. Player did not mean 'lucky' in a real sense; he was being ironic. His true message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ But there is a limit to this idea. The question of where that limit is, or if it even exists, is part of the nature-nurture debate. This debate discusses whether talent is something we are born with or something we develop through practice, especially in sports. However, it is not really a balanced debate; nurture has clearly won. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent in sports, music, business, and other areas comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that anyone can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has inspired many popular books, including Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, Talent Is Overrated, and Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice. These books generally agree that practice is the most important factor and suggest that ‘10,000 hours is both necessary and enough to make anyone an expert in anything.’ 

However, as Epstein discusses in his interesting book, this is often not the case. He points out a major problem in much of the research on what makes people excellent: it usually looks only at successful people. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others do not, and how to separate what is natural from what comes from environment, support, opportunity, and hard work. Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and from the Caribbean to the Arctic, to find answers. In Alaska, he discovers that the key to success in the toughest sled dog race may be the drive and desire of the husky dogs, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary. Some interpretations of the 10,000-hours rule assume that commitment and determination are choices we can make. But what if, as the huskies show, a person’s drive also has a genetic part? These examples highlight the complexity of the topic. 

Epstein makes a distinction between hardware (nature) and software (nurture) and agrees that in elite athletes, both are necessary. He does not ignore the importance of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. However, Epstein also looks at cases where genetics are very important and cannot be overlooked. He also discusses race and gender issues. He asks: ‘If only practice hours matter, then why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?’ Sometimes, the best questions are the most obvious."""
87,"Text: A recent international report shows that many children living in rich, developed countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, like televisions or computers, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main problem. This idea matches other discussions about childhood today. A follow-up study interviewed some children to understand their feelings better. The study found that many children do not wish for the latest technology; instead, they said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many people over 40 often talk about how free they felt as children, spending long summer days exploring, swimming, or building forts. They believe this was much better and healthier than the protected lives of today’s children. However, they often forget that they are the ones who created these protective rules for their own kids, keeping them from exploring freely. 

Griffiths’ book contains strong arguments. She discusses how the fear of dangers in the outside world and the focus on child-centered consumerism are connected. Parents’ fears of danger lead them to keep their children at home, which benefits the toy and gadget industry that sells entertainment for indoor kids. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or requiring kids to wear goggles during traditional playground games. While I am not sure how common these strict rules are, Griffiths expresses her anger about them in a powerful way. She also talks passionately about other issues related to childhood freedoms and rules, from fairy tales to school regulations. 

However, the problem is that Griffiths sometimes goes too far with her ideas and ignores important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares the modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths has a romantic view of children. Although she acknowledges that children can be mischievous, she mostly presents an idealized view of them that may not match reality. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to handle bigger dangers later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Also, not all children may want to follow the adventurous model that Griffiths admires. What about the shy, cautious children who prefer to stay at home? Perhaps the real issue is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether by keeping them too safe or pushing them too hard to explore."

I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and in my life, but this skill is not just from my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play. 

My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those that have the most to learn tend to play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they are allowed to. 

Play is a natural way for adults and mammals to learn. The most important skills children need to live happy and productive lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling their emotions. Creativity is essential for success in today’s world. We no longer need people who just follow instructions or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. 

If we can encourage creative thinkers, we will have a strong workforce. Creative minds are playful minds. Adults we call geniuses are those who keep their childlike creativity throughout their lives. Albert Einstein said that school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he found it again after leaving school. He called his innovative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen next. 

We cannot teach creativity, but we can lose it through schooling that focuses on fixed questions instead of children’s own questions. More importantly, children need to learn how to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality, which are important for their future. 

Play is voluntary, meaning players can choose to stop. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players know they must keep each other happy to continue the game. This ability to quit makes play a very democratic activity. 

However, school has become more difficult: breaks are shorter, homework is more, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside of school, adult-led sports have taken the place of spontaneous games. “Play dates” with adults have replaced unsupervised play, and adults often feel they must step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. 

These changes have happened slowly but have had a big impact over time. They are caused by various social factors, including parents’ fears, warnings from experts about dangers, less connected neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which is much easier than the old way of standing outside an office with a sign saying ""hire me."" However, having this access also means there is a higher chance of making mistakes.

For example, a young job seeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the job seeker thought she could help him find a job. But the executive was upset by the request. She felt it was wrong to share her contacts with someone she didn’t know. Instead of just rejecting his request, she sent a harsh and sarcastic message that became very popular online. Many people were shocked by her response, and she might regret how she reacted. However, if this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media for work, it could actually help them.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. Ironically, social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and create a different image of themselves. You could have long conversations online and then ignore those people in real life. With the right pictures and songs on Facebook, you could seem like a more interesting person. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. For some young people, the line between personal and professional use is not clear. They may still think that being bold and confident online is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that the rules of social networking have changed, and they must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual in their messages and come off as arrogant. This reinforces the idea that young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are struggling to find jobs, which is why they are using social media. This perception of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing some research or helping in another way. This approach increases your chances of getting a helpful response. Avoid sending generic messages, and keep your tone respectful to leave a good impression. Remember, social media can be a great way to make important connections, but it needs to be used carefully to avoid being ignored."
90,"Text: ""Anyone who claims they can accurately predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. Looking at the numbers, newspapers appear to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national daily newspapers has dropped by about one-third to one-half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26 percent of US citizens, down from 45 percent in 2001. Many people confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will be gone within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were finished and that the daily newspaper would be the most important source of news. Yet theatre survived, as did radio during the TV era, and cinema has continued to thrive despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745 percent since 2008. 

Newspapers were once considered new media, but it took several centuries for them to become the main source of news. This change happened because producing timely news for a large audience became possible and affordable in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railways, and the telegraph. It was also important that people began to understand that everything around them was constantly changing and that they needed regular updates – a concept that was not common in medieval times. 

In the past, people mainly noticed the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease, which they could not predict. Life was, as writer Alain de Botton describes, ‘cyclical’ and ‘the most important truths were recurring’. Before the 19th century, journalism as a profession where one could earn a living hardly existed. Even then, there was no clear reason why most people needed news regularly, whether daily or weekly. 

In some ways, the regular publication of newspapers can be a limitation. Online news allows readers to choose when to read based on the urgency of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms help us personalize news according to our interests. When major stories happen, online news providers can give updates almost instantly. Mistakes and misunderstandings can be corrected quickly, and there are no space limits for stories, allowing for more detailed analysis. 

This is very different from the restrictions of newspaper publishing. However, many news providers do not seem to recognize the internet's potential for spreading knowledge and understanding. Instead, they focus on being the first to report news, increasing reader comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In the medieval world, news was often shared in busy marketplaces or taverns, where truth competed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be returning to that situation. Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works. They may face extinction, or perhaps, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic world, newspapers will find a way to help us understand and gain wisdom."""
91,"Text: ""If humans truly felt at home under the moon and stars, we would walk in the dark happily, just like many animals that are active at night. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes that are made for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genes, even if we don’t think of ourselves as daytime beings, just like we don’t think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This is the only way to understand what we have done to the night. We have changed the night by filling it with light. This control is similar to building a dam on a river. While there are benefits to this, it also brings problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 

Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine into the sky instead of focusing it down where it is needed. Bad lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and rhythms that many living things, including us, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light spreads into nature, it affects many aspects of life, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

For most of human history, the term ‘light pollution’ would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city in the world. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no public gas lights in the streets for another seven years. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than to see its faint glow. 

We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but that is far from the truth. There are many nocturnal species among mammals. Light is a strong biological force that attracts many species. The effect is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds can be ‘captured’ by searchlights or gas flares, circling until they fall. Birds that migrate at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange hours because of artificial light. 

It was once believed that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Unlike astronomers, most of us may not need a clear view of the night sky for our work, but we do need darkness. Ignoring darkness is pointless. It is just as important for our health as light is; changing our internal clock can lead to health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological reflection of the regular pattern of light on Earth. These rhythms are so important to our existence that changing them is like changing our center of gravity. 

In the end, humans are just as affected by light pollution as frogs living near a bright highway. Living in our own bright world, we have disconnected ourselves from our natural and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a real way, light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the scale of our existence, which is best understood against the backdrop of a dark night with the Milky Way above us."""

The founder of a large international company recently said that his business would stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision seems to be inspired by a similar policy from an internet company. The founder mentioned that he got the idea from a happy email from his daughter, which many newspapers have shared. However, this way of announcing the change seems like a way to make a possibly unfair policy sound better. 

Is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational corporation has 50,000 employees and many different services, such as finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work schedules. In a big company, it can be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business. The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they feel sure that their work and their team are up to date. But is it really possible to be that sure? 

No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works; you pause your work, but it keeps building up. Employees who follow these new guidelines might not take any leave at all, or they might feel guilty about taking time off. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers do not take enough leave, it could lower their productivity over time. 

There could also be pressure from coworkers and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. This pressure can already affect when people start and finish their workday. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a place with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If workers feel they cannot take the leave they need because they might seem lazy, they lose the safety that comes with having legal rights to time off. 

This policy might create a situation where employees do not feel they can take their entitled leave, or they might still use their legal rights as a guide, making the new policy useless. Modern technology allows us to receive work messages anytime and anywhere, which makes it hard to separate work from personal time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees asked how it fit with the old way of tracking time off. If the company cannot track how much time employees work, why should they have a different standard for time off? 

However, a problem with having no set working hours is that every hour could feel like a working hour. Employees might not know if their working hours are being watched by their employer, which can make them feel like they have to monitor themselves, leading to negative effects. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid annual leave because rest and leisure are important for their mental and physical health. The benefits of unlimited leave, like better morale and creativity, can happen without sacrificing worker well-being. Therefore, I am not sure if allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is really the goal or the likely result of this policy."

Journal-based peer review is the process of having experts in a field check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. It is believed to help prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure the trustworthiness of published research? The answer is both yes and no. 

The current state of scientific publishing is changing. While I still believe in journal-based peer review, I see that things are shifting. The increasing use of preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review, is an important part of this change. Preprints allow researchers to quickly share new results so that others can read, critique, and build on them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which has changed the motivations of authors and reviewers. The competition for publication in top journals encourages scientists to do their best work, and these journals publish a lot of excellent research. However, the rewards for publishing in these journals can lead to shortcuts, where important data is left out to make the research look better. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal rather than its overall quality. For top journals, this can depend on how timely or newsworthy the research is, rather than just its scientific merit.

These issues are well known, but many people are hesitant to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints could help solve these problems without completely changing the system. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they have not been widely accepted. This slow acceptance is partly due to scientists being cautious and partly because of the belief that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a concern that publishing papers without peer review could lead to poor-quality research, but this has not happened so far.

Preprints may not be peer-reviewed, but authors know that they will be open to critique and discussion from a global community of reviewers. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shares her experience: “My paper critiqued a published paper, which is not well handled by traditional journals. In their anonymous peer review system, the original authors might block a critical paper, or if they are not chosen as reviewers, they might complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their feedback. All comments are public, so readers can judge the quality of the arguments. The risk of rejection by journals is less of a concern since we still have the preprint and public comments, so our work is not wasted.”

Preprint archives allow informal scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also be a good way to share negative results, which are often overlooked by journals that focus too much on new discoveries. Additionally, being on preprint archives increases the number of times papers are read and cited, showing the effectiveness of sharing research this way. By using the internet’s culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the work itself, rather than where it is published."

When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" Their answers usually do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it. The first paragraph was a scientific description, and the second was from the object's point of view, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The item? An oxygen mask – an unusual choice that helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. This exercise led to laughter and good discussions.

When I was in school, poetry often confused me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand and feel. After school, most people pay less attention to poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down by its simplicity or because you don’t understand it at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we hope to find in poems? Isn’t a poem a place for deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever thoughts? The answer seems to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music is hard to beat with its mix of lyrics and melody. However, one useful thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life is full of uncertainty, unlike reading sentences one after another. But these thoughts still don’t explain what a poem really is.

If you search online for ""poem,"" it leads you to ""poetry,"" which is described as a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is fine for English professors, but it misses the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is someone who makes things. So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – unpredictable and untameable – or to machines – precise and human-made – depending on their views. But these comparisons often break down when examined closely.

The most valuable part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about both. It can help us see ordinary things in a new way. Poems can be mental objects, especially since song lyrics often stick in our heads. The mix of words and melody has power, just like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, right in front of you: A poem can impact you like nothing else, even though it is just ink on paper, like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or an ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article or story, but it is not usually made to be sold. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not just a product for the market; it exists for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"Text: ""I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. £70 was a lot of money back then, and it might have been better spent on something useful for our home. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I discovered has brought me joy. I have always enjoyed feeling connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I decided to go to a nearby spot that I knew had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then, the detector beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't walk away without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned more dirt away, the ball turned into a thick, beautifully designed loop. I stopped and stared, remembering to breathe. I had seen something like this before - the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It is the most famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with a gold ring at each end, just like the one I was looking at.

I took it to my car. At every stoplight on the way home, I looked at the torc on the passenger seat. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the only cleaning it had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I have something for you.’ While looking at my find, I heard my wife come into the room and stop. ‘What is it?’ she asked after a moment. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try the torc on because we were afraid of damaging it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I felt anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it underneath.

The law says that such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around, still talking, and then stopped. The torc was confirmed as authentic and was eventually sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the owner of the field and me. But the torc means more to me than just money. It is something I have saved for the nation. People often say to me, ‘Now that you’ve found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing - not while there’s a chance of catching an even bigger fish tomorrow."""
96,"Text: ""Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share stories of their carefully planned trips, where every moment is filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans often include long naps during afternoon rainstorms and lazy mornings in comfortable beds? Better sleep is one of the nice benefits of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours – more than 12 – I spent sleeping each day. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Away from home and my own bed, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could enjoy a deep, dream-filled sleep that was better than I expected. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I think there is more to it than just relaxing. I believe that sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we open ourselves to new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. We take in many new things – cultures, music, landscapes, and even different ways of moving. When we sleep, we process all this new information. It makes sense that sleep feels more intense when we are traveling. Sleep also changes from place to place. People worry about jet lag, but I think the challenges I face after long trips are more about adjusting to local cultures than just time differences. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, slow down around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then become active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to the island’s different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have truly arrived. I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new Dominican friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and the conversation faded away. One by one, my friends left the table to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why my hosts had so many pillows on the floor. I took some for myself and followed their lead. I had heard about the Latin American tradition of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep has another great quality: I remember it. Away from my usual sleep routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my mind while I sleep in a new place. If the idea of ‘slow travel’ – enjoying every moment instead of rushing around – is what makes a modern traveler aware, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my ambitious friends that travel sleep is, in fact, an important part of the experience."""
97,"Text: The woman turned away from the mirror. “What do you think? Please be honest.” Mia picked up a medium-sized hat that was soft and had a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said to her customer with careful kindness. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face that looked a bit like a bulldog. “But it is so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This beautiful little hat will make me stand out.” She sighed and touched the red and black miniature top hat that was tilted at a fun angle on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” Mia knew she couldn’t change the woman’s mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at her daughter’s wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since they had all been together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie, who they didn’t know much about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, her husband Jeff quickly pointed out, “What kind of name is that?” “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “More like something very pretentious,” Jeff said. He didn’t like anything showy or fancy. He also didn’t understand Mia’s way of being polite and careful with her words. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The problem with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you’re too polite for your own good.” 

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered through the back door of Medlar House. Her commute from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia had the idea to turn the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. But Mia knew from her friends that many women struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women came from far away to her shop in the village of Little Pelham, where she provided a relaxed and welcoming place for them to try on as many hats as they needed. With changing rooms available, she encouraged her customers to bring their outfits so that everything matched perfectly. Recently, she had also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"Text: 'It’s a long way from London to Atlanta, and at his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye thinks about the latest step in his amazing sports journey. He is very confident, but even he seems surprised by how far he has come from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly starting a new career. Although he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen for one of the major teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still learning about his new position in the game. The idea that a 21-year-old beginner from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports is surprising. But Lawrence is good at proving people wrong. After being offered a place at Oxford University to study law, he decided to focus on training for the discus instead, having previously played rugby. Within 20 months of starting, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. 

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for the discus, preparing for the world championships. ‘Yes,’ he says when asked about his sudden chance for a big NFL contract. ‘American football was in my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA. I had thought about it in school in London, but it seemed crazy then.’ Soon after arriving in America, he read about the NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played the game, did he think he would be good enough to attend the trials? ‘Pretty much,’ he says simply. ‘I went on the website and applied.’ 

He must have been nervous about being tested alongside men who have played American football their whole lives? ‘No,’ he says. ‘Not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things.’ He doesn’t talk a lot, but it’s clear he believes in his abilities. The statistics he provided in various tests showed that he was the most impressive player. ‘I was very happy to hear that.’ This was the only time he showed pride in his talents. However, he is also cautious. Lawrence has no experience in American football. How can such a beginner make it into an NFL team? ‘From what the coaches have told me, I have all the qualities needed. It’s just about how hard I work,’ he replies. 

Will he be calm while waiting to hear if he has been selected? ‘I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I’m definitely going to be chosen, but I’m not too worried.’ This calmness might come from his disappointing Olympic discus final when he came last. He seems to have moved on from that experience and is proud that he qualified for the final with an impressive last throw. ‘That was an amazing day,’ he says. ‘The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. It’s something I can return to.’ After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought Lawrence had let a big moment affect him. He refuses to comment on that. 

The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial reasons are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his physical talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? ‘I understand why someone would say that,’ he replies. ‘I’m trying to achieve something I’ve dreamed about since I was a school kid. And if it doesn’t work out, I can go back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.’"
99,"Text: 'We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green made me feel better that, even though it was mid-September, it had not yet started to change in Siberia. I could see no signs of human life, and the view stretched out in a strange mix of mountains, streams, and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. “Good morning, Robert,” he said, saying my name with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the far reaches of civilization to sell safety clothing to local mining companies. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with the help of a dictionary, I had managed to tell him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. “But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it these days. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will be riding with a friend called Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and with one word, “Holodna” (cold), he pointed outside. I tried to support my case by showing him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, but I left out the fact that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. Most of my clothes and equipment had been bought at low prices. In reality, I was not sure they would be good enough. This was especially true of my large postman’s over-trousers which I had bought for £10. 

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall that morning was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular question. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In the row in front of me slouched Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. “OK,” it said. It was six years later that I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to control my classes, the job did meet many important needs for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. Ever since that first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger and bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was certainly his biggest so far. At times he thought that the ride would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an amazing adventure, finding that he could handle each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the people who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive.'"

In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops while flying at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to participate. An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form confirmed that I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. “The horizon is your best friend,” I was told, and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I also promised to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was told not to touch anything. As we were getting ready to take off, I was nervous. My legs were up in front of me, and I tried not to touch the important steering pedals or switches. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To survive without fainting, you need to stay calm and focused. You must tense up and relax at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea.

As we started to speed down the runway, I felt anxious. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and gasped as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out and made another sharp left turn, diving down. I felt my stomach drop as we flew low, aiming for a small space between two pylons. We passed them at 400 km per hour, and I felt a rush of excitement, but then we turned sharply again.

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, but my hand was shaking so much that the plane shook too. Then Dario said something, but I couldn’t hear him. Instead of answering, he did a barrel roll, turning the plane completely upside down. “Are you okay?” he asked. “Yes,” I replied. “Have you had enough?” “No,” I lied. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a full circle. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy roller coasters, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, while we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, “Relax, relax, look up.” I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It felt easy compared to what the pilots experience during races. To show this, Dario took out some sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily started eating. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I kept dreaming about the loop over and over again."

Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever been amazed by videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, it is likely that he filmed them. He says his favorite temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours, I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater,"" he explains. He is now a well-known cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife series.

""I started at a good time. When I began, very few people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became known as the cold man. It felt like there were many amazing scenes waiting to be filmed."" The camera and communication technology were very simple when he started 35 years ago. ""It is much easier to film today. Back then, if you shot something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today, you can have too much material.""

""My experience in cold conditions is valuable. I know how to handle it. I have spent so much time on sea ice that it feels normal to me. I do get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes."" Allan says that wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures and embarrassing moments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not identify the birds.

Recently, Allan got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He did not expect it to be easy. It is a place with polar bears and is only for the bravest or most foolish people. In April, it is usually -32°C, the wind is strong, and carrying cameras in deep snow is very difficult. After walking for five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan had only seen one mother bear and her cub. However, on day 24, he felt like he was in the world of bears, moving at their speed and using their senses. 

""We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. After five hours of watching, I catch a quick glimpse that I almost miss. But the camera is focused on the hole, and I quickly look through the viewfinder. Nothing happens for a couple of seconds, and then I see a black nose. The nose becomes a muzzle, then a full head, and in less than a minute, she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She looks at me but is not scared. Just as I think it can't get better, she slides down the slope. I think she is enjoying it,"" he recalls, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ""It is clearly their first view of the world. It is showtime on the slopes, and we have front-row seats.""

Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and see its effects firsthand. He believes he could create an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming in extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even bigger adventure. Explorers are confident and determined people, and this time, there is a lot at stake. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre trek to the North Pole to measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will give a clear picture of how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar region.

Pen was prepared for this work from a young age. His father’s old nanny, who had worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, took care of him. She toughened him up by sending him out into the Scottish mountains during storms with very few clothes. His father also inspired his love for adventures in cold places, and Pen developed great physical strength. 

Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and shares his passion for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home. She once raced against him in a famous mountain event, where she and her horse finished an hour ahead of him. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. He finds it harder to be away from them this time. When he last left, his children were one and five years old, and he made a mistake in how he said goodbye. He told his son to take care of his mother and sister, which made the boy very worried. Because of this, Pen plans to have little contact with them while he is in the Arctic, as he believes it will be better for them.

In the days before he leaves, he is carefully preparing his equipment. He knows that out on the ice, it is very difficult to fix things or do anything complicated. He will be joined by Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support crew of six people who will fly in supplies. Pen feels that being part of a team can be stressful for him, and he is also thinking about his age. He will turn 47 soon and feels he has not trained enough. He often finds that organizing things takes more time than he expects, which makes him worried about his physical limits.

Pen believes that his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge that motivated earlier explorers. He admits that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal and not very useful to anyone outside the polar adventure community. This time, however, scientists will benefit from the data they collect, and they want to involve as many people as possible in understanding what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. He feels this work is important, and they are the only ones who can do it. He believes their unique skills, which may seem strange in everyday life, are now very relevant and useful."
103,"Text: 'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Although I enjoyed these different activities, I didn’t have anything competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape so I could compete for an Olympic spot if I felt inspired again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle’s invitation: “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I started to miss that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren’t very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, even though it was called an adventure, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But being an underdog without pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had managed to gather the large entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We talked about the other costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a better chance than most, but we still needed to work hard to secure it. Besides the race costs, I also had to think about the money I would lose by being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It feels good that people are interested. But I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without having a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just talk about what I did before. I would actually be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My preparation for the Olympics was tough, and my life was focused on getting in the best shape; but looking back, it was quite simple. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the training program was set, and there were doctors and dieticians. I was worried about how people would see me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV, or else I would have chosen a better partner to win the race. My worries faded as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing. It’s also about mental strength. Ben had completed the difficult Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and lived on a deserted island for a year. However, he couldn’t row well. I was surprised by how little he understood about rowing, and he was shocked by my lack of patience. I could have been more understanding, but I felt it was important to tell Ben how much he needed to improve. I should have realized that this would be his level when I agreed to race with him.'"
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of cold, empty landscapes, perhaps because I was tired of the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take many tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips that can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but soon had more than 100. Recently, they took over a second property called the 'wilderness farm,’ which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I understood what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions are tough, and the work is very physical,’ they said. I started packing right away. 

November 6, London: On my flight, I stared at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies. I was supposed to memorize their names before I arrived, but I felt distracted and nervous. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. However, I felt like I was seeing winter moving south, with rivers freezing over.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta: The bus ride north was everything I hoped for. We drove through endless dark forests with thin trees weighed down by snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrived at the farm after dark, and as soon as I walked in, I was given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asked. It was a rhetorical question. I followed the sound of barking, which grew louder as I reached the dogsheds. Three people were running back and forth, pulling the huskies out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs were very excited, straining against their ropes. I could barely introduce myself, but the others were too busy to talk. I stood to the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone waved at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fell into the nearest sled. A command was shouted, and with a jerk, we were off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

November 15, Hetta: It didn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I faced a tough questioning about what I could do for the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asked. I was confused. I didn’t know. Further questions showed that I was not very useful: I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and had never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving license?’ someone asked finally. I nodded, feeling relieved. The basics of dog-sledding are easy to learn: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, no matter what, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seemed complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs became hard in freezing conditions. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head was full of instructions, and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds – and from being pulled around by excited huskies. But I felt proud. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I emailed my friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,"Text: 'On that day, as Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters gathered to understand her amazing performance. It was noted that her time would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special natural treatment, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended to help heal Radcliffe's injuries from an accident when she ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe says that the achievement didn’t fully sink in at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. She and her support team had decided not to set limits on their goals. Their motto was: no limits. During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Next to him was Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could keep up her fast pace, worried it might make her drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry at this concern, but he understood that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so quickly. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to calculate. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers at a fast speed but still managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster than that.’ She remembers the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a while. Radcliffe thought, “I will come back and do it next year.” Unfortunately, that did not happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete with such an unusual running style had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, giving her daily sessions to help with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ‘I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle the level of pain she could. She would make me work hard because I had to go deep into her muscles, and I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards because I was in so much pain.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ‘Gerard, you’re 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ As soon as he arrived, she was ready for a two-hour session. ‘Paula would push you to your limits. That’s what made her so good.’ During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became upset. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I trained very hard, but there are people who are more talented. I thought it would happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it’s because people are racing against each other instead of racing against themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental attitude of never slowing down, even when you have the race won, probably helped me because I never thought, “I can relax now.” It was always: “keep pushing as hard as you can.” Radcliffe did not know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run that fast again. However, she inspired many women to take up long-distance running.'"
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ happening in Britain, and I believed we had created a series that contributed something new to this movement. However, I worried whether people would enjoy a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, memories, and science. I watched the first episode with mixed feelings of happiness and fear. I didn’t need to worry. The success of the show led to many other interesting projects, including a book based on my experiences at my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one linked to its own TV show. In these books, the journey was often physical, involving passports and travel plans. The latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, takes you around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who finds joy in making golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These artisans have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew I would disappoint some people by leaving out their favorites. I could imagine people asking, ‘Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ However, after a long meeting with the TV production team, we finally created a list that included something for everyone. This experience reinforced my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, shaped by their emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book’s title, I knew I wouldn’t claim that the recipes were the ‘best’. But I believed that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant practice. Trying out ideas and changing them until you create something unique. The TV series allowed me to explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before, and I was excited to connect food with memories because I started my career in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato and going to a dairy farm that did not meet our standards for perfection, which made us stop filming there! While refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanning machine, and almost burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a real Neapolitan-style pizza.'"
107,"Text: 'We were still a long way from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the engine cover. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets and a serious look on his face. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he finally said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field went on for miles. There was not much in it, just grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I agreed, because it was best to support Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John get smaller as he walked away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But my voice didn’t sound sure. “Liar.” I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I became. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van along the road to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind at all. They waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café. It was set back from the road and not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “I think it might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat down in the shade. The tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup in there,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “I guess it’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said as it began to get dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road. She made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home now that our van had to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.'"
108,"Text: 'Lucy was talking at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike her, they were not competing: a guy from Tokyo and a girl from a European city whose name Lucy didn’t quite catch over the noise. They were both about ten years older than her and spoke good English. They talked about the pieces they were playing, where they had traveled recently, and where they were going next. “I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy told them. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often felt overwhelmed by the concerts and competitions that took her around the world and made her miss so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with different tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she had been chosen. There had been a party, and Lucy’s dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her. Her little brother Gus dreamed about being at the same festival one day. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The truth was, Lucy hadn’t even applied. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. “I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,” her mom had said. Lucy thought, “More like you didn't want to give me the chance to say no.” At that time, Lucy believed that making waves was the worst thing a person could do, and she didn’t even think about trying to get out of it. The guy from Tokyo leaned forward as if he had misheard her. “Tanglewood?” “Yeah.” “How old are you?” “Fifteen.” He exchanged a look with the girl, who said, “Wow.” Lucy hadn’t meant to brag. It was hard to know when she was just sharing her experiences and when she was showing off. “It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're going to try...” “Excuse me,” the girl said, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy stayed. “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, shaggy hair, like many musicians, to show they were music lovers but also a bit rebellious. “Once. When I was about eight.” He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared at her side. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.” He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They're not the competition.” “Everyone is the competition.” Her grandfather took her around the room and made her talk to everyone he thought was important. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, understanding only part of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after leaving the party, her grandfather turned to her. “You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” She liked that part. Being someone important. Even if it meant some people were jealous or thought she was too young to get the attention she did. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her any special respect from the kids she had gone to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know and wouldn’t care that she could play a Rachmaninov piece perfectly. But in places like this, she knew she mattered.'"
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I decided to see what experts say about this topic – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of real-life friends, a good sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is now a big part of growing up. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do – they live in it. That’s not necessarily good or bad – it depends on how you use it.’ 

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s ‘like hanging out at the youth club, as parents did in their youth, to share jokes and catch up on news: a kind of virtual youth club.’ He believes it helps teenagers develop their identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and connect with their peers. 

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you find your identity: you can share your favorite music or sports, discover what you like, and see that others have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can help shy people: ‘Talking online can be easier than face-to-face, and it allows you to practice social skills in a less stressful way.’ 

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with special interests connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people like you, you can feel more connected and popular in a different way,’ he says. 

Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘It’s young people who find new interests online, join networks of similar individuals, and create their own content who are really using social networks well.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative tool: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity. Passionate photographers can connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interests. ‘This all helps with job opportunities and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and build brand awareness – and you need to know how it works to attract customers. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they could all be potential customers. If you connect all those networks, you have your customer base.’ 

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and enter the job market, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is an important skill in the 21st century and is key to being employable in a digital world.’"""
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents were not looking for a quiet time as they planned our summer vacation this year. My dad seemed determined to create what he thought was the perfect family bonding trip. “Not enough people do this anymore,” he and my mother said repeatedly before our vacation, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, “There are probably good reasons why!” 

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothes for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks, although I had some ways to cope. With barely enough space left for us in the car, we began “The Family Great American Road Trip.” Leaving our big home for smaller places for the next five thousand miles, I wasn’t the only one wondering what we were getting into. 

We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that cattle have the right-of-way on the road! The next day, we woke up early and continued our journey. I noticed a pattern: deserts turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was still unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town hinted at what we would experience later. 

At one point, as we climbed to our next stop, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. We saw a mix of old and new everywhere we went. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. Disappointment turned to laughter when we took pictures by the huge “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ‘Bear jams,’ where park volunteers helped manage traffic, were common as we drove through, especially when a bear crossed the road. Our close encounter with a bear (and a worried park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories. 

As we continued driving, life back home faded away, and even the hotel we stayed in, which had many problems, couldn’t dampen our excitement. It was an old, creaky building with no internet or cell phone service, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, my family and I headed back south. My parents were right: you don’t need to go to a faraway place to find something special. It was a bit sad to be home again, but at least I hadn’t fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our crazy journey to look through and remember. I knew that the best memories would be the unexpected and spontaneous moments.'"

Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would spend the next year finishing her last school courses, living under the care of the college Head. It was her final year at school, so it would not be fair for her to move. Amy was happy because she got the best room at the college, which had its own kitchen and study area. She also had free access to the Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house.

Rose only had vague memories of her grandmother from holidays, and she had never known her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited about it, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to get to know Rose again. Rose was not sure why her parents did not get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Because of this, Rose had spent summers away from her only other family member. The last time Rose said goodbye to Daisy, she was only ten years old, but she remembered happy times.

Dahlia told Rose that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved to bring people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips within a week. The thought made her smile. Daisy was not a typical frail old lady; she seemed to go to more social events than anyone else. Before the move, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time, Rose wanted one thing: her independence. Living with Daisy would meet her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission every time. She wanted to avoid being nagged about homework or staying out late, and she did not want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood.

Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, as Dahlia insisted. Rose was very happy. They all agreed that it would be about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If either of them went too far, they would talk about it again.

Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her a lot. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This would be her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. At least she knew this was the last time, as she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new moment in her life, a new piece in the puzzle that was her life."
112,"Text: Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first person to think she might write a novel. “I believed that writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed like a big challenge. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’ The novel she started at that age is now about to be published. “I recently told my former teacher about it, and she was surprised. She thought I would probably write a book when I was 30 or 40. I never thought that – I didn’t understand why I should wait to do something I might be good at.” 

It is a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a significant achievement: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except for the age of its main character, suggests that it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support. But she doesn’t need any help. She is independent, with a bright face and a lively mind, but also a calmness that keeps her from being overly confident. 

Charlotte understands the limits of her youth. When I ask her about the complex moral questions in her book, she says, “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers,” she laughs. “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I’m very wise. I was just interested in exploring the idea of taking responsibility.” 

She has a theory about teenagers and how they are often misrepresented in books aimed at them. She believes there are three types of teenagers shown in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially. Reading about these character types annoyed her. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who aren’t lacking in some way. Some writers give the impression that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience. When this idea is pushed on them, it can hurt their self-confidence.” 

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy authors, but their books almost discouraged her from writing. “Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep topics about psychology and life. I wondered: is this what I need to do to write a good book, and am I really capable of it?” However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel. “It tells you that if the reader starts to guess what will happen, the suspense is probably gone.” 

Some might say that Charlotte’s parents, both journalists, played a key role in getting her novel published. In fact, her father’s connection in publishing helped get her book read at first. She recognizes her good luck because it is hard for anyone to get a first novel read, no matter their age. “Every aspiring writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you’re on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp quickly and flew into the air, arms waving. Even to us, it looked wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and flipped into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed can be unpredictable.’ Maybe freestyle skiing wasn’t for me. On past skiing holidays, I had enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I felt I would be laughed at if I tried to join them. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students jumped, trying new tricks, and landed in foam pits – not a realistic way to prepare for the real slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their moves for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan cheerfully told us. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope gets steep again. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which is safer. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. So, speed is important. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my fear and go straight towards the jump. My legs would almost go backward as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt exhausted. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, looking at the snowy mountains, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied moves we would make while ski-jumping, while others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing while spinning in the air. Gareth gave us tips. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed improvement – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, and then I found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes before I finally landed correctly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud of achieving my goal. But that feeling didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I made myself keep my speed up as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""

Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you grip the harness tightly. The ride suddenly stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly moves up. There is a pause, then a quick drop that makes your stomach feel like it’s in the air. You move fast forward, turn sharply to the left, and then go upside down. Your senses are confused, and you scream in fear. But you chose to be here, just like millions of others who pay to enter theme parks.

What surprises me is that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are a big business. To create the excitement and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. The idea of being a ""rollercoaster designer"" might sound like a child's dream job, but it is actually very challenging. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping riders safe. They also need to add new features to keep visitors interested.

While many people think rollercoasters are getting more intense, most of the techniques used today were actually invented by a US designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. During his time, there were fewer safety rules, and some rides were very extreme, which made many passengers uncomfortable. Now, designers have to follow the track designs made by special ride manufacturers.

I talked to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a ""thrill engineer,"" said, ""The skill is in putting the pieces together."" Dr. John Roberts, a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it is important to quickly switch between feelings of excitement and safety so that riders feel thrilled but not scared. 

To create an amazing ride, the teams must come up with a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, that fits with new features like the tallest drops or the most twists. However, Professor Walker noted that, like in many creative jobs, experience and instinct are very important. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, added that it helps to be passionate about thrills to understand what riders want and to test the rides before they open.

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers will use new technology like virtual reality. Walker said we shouldn’t expect too much from it. He explained that while virtual reality can make rides look exciting, the real experience of being on a physical rollercoaster is what matters most, and that will continue to be important for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she manages to do both activities in her busy life. “Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, following the orders of strict choreographers, and how stressful that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day,” she tells me. As a choreographer, she teaches and enjoys working with young students. “A dancer who is just starting out is often open to trying new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they don’t yet know their strengths and weaknesses. This lack of understanding helps them accept even tough criticism. They might challenge what I say sometimes, but I appreciate their honest feedback.” 

When Miranda begins working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. “There may be a piece of music I don’t like, but I still make sure to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a certain composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I still need to find solutions. I won’t go back and choose a new piece. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and have the option to switch to different pieces – it would help improve the mood when rehearsals get tough. Unfortunately, I’m often working on big productions where the music has already been decided by the composer, and I can’t change it.” 

Miranda does not want to be tied to one institution. “I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. However, I have to remember that the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So, I need to be ready to change how I work each time I go somewhere new, instead of just doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.” 

The conversation shifts to a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. “There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,” says Miranda. “This one tries to show the real life inside a dance company. There was a scene where a young dancer is getting many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized it. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch but very real. The public often underestimates the amount of work and dedication needed in ballet.” 

I ask Miranda what makes a great ballet or dance production. “It’s when everything the company has worked on – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to expect, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can help you get away with a few mistakes. I’ve been part of productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props is very distracting. That’s disappointing.” 

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? “People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to focus on becoming an expert in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, but maybe one day I will be happy to be known for one thing. For now, I just want to expand my horizons.”"

I agreed that there are amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation inspired my crazy four-day trip and a film that encourages people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main part of the film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even one night on the beach. Several friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I have walked on many trips in recent years, but this was something completely different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I walked on main roads, which allowed me to stop at cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock with my sandwiches blowing away. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to share how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can see the film on my website.'"

My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I would not be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked confused, he smiled and showed me on board. Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would follow us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, which made me nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was very happy when I finally did it on my own. The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to enjoy the scenery. As the swims got longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. I felt like I didn’t need the support boat much anymore. I can hardly wait to come back next year.'"

I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and my life is always interesting – which makes it a great job for someone young like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family, so I often flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stayed in my mind when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for something new. 

At the interview, there were many young people, and many of us were hired. Like me, they were often well-qualified and changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say – I wanted to say more than just that I loved to travel, as many others would say the same. Instead, I talked about my strengths and past work experience – and I got the job! I would recommend this kind of work to anyone because there are many reasons it is rewarding – but the free flights are not the main reason. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: ‘no one is finished until everyone is finished.’ It feels like a big family – even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do have difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!"""
119,"Text: ""At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. 

At the beginning of the week, some children miss home. It is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds who feel this way the most. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and at the end of their week, they all come to us and thank us because they have had a great time.

It is not only the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call us often to ask how their child is doing, which is not necessary. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to tell the parents to call back later. We also see some children who come dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it is important."""

It opened in London last year after five years in the USA, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, putting on the show with an all-British cast was difficult. The UK has more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night, with everyone wanting to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He shared how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ 

What do his friends think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I felt proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 

While the young actors were already musicians, some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said that the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is definitely worth seeing.'"
