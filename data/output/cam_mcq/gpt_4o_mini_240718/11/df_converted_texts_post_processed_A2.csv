A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins. Public check-ins are when you tell people online where you are. The website said that when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are, including some you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides. 
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a lot of people. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can get lost in this sharing. It can feel overwhelming. However, there is hope. A long time ago, some people, called online pioneers, explored the internet and learned about its dangers. They faced many problems, like losing jobs and friends, before social media was created. These pioneers, who we now call bloggers, have important stories to tell us.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his experiences. He created a blog where he wrote about everything in his life. In January 1996, he began posting every day, and many people started to read his blog. Hall was open about his life, and he wrote about any topic. Some people thought this was just showing off, but others saw it as art.
One day, visitors to Hall’s blog found that his homepage was gone. Instead, there was a video called Dark Night. In the video, Hall explained that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the problem of sharing online still exists. Sharing online can be fun, but if you think it will make people want to be with you, you might be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, including some she had made fun of. Because of this, she lost her job. People who study online behavior call this the ""online distribution effect."" This means that many of us feel we can say things online that we would never say in person. But the internet is not a place where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives. If we forget this, we can make big mistakes.
Armstrong’s story had a happy ending. Even though she was sad and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is popular among ""mommy bloggers,"" and her writing helps support her family. She learned an important lesson: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
2,C2,"'Some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixes documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we do not understand. Scientists can be a bit proud sometimes, but even the most confident physicist would not say they know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt they needed to warn the public about the film, calling it things like ‘atrocious’ and ‘very dangerous’. This made me curious to see the movie. 
At first, I did not understand why the film was so important. Some scientists talked about new discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film talked about these discoveries, I began to see why it was interesting. One claim was that water molecules can be changed by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the feelings of people around it. The movie showed pictures of ice crystals that looked beautiful after being talked to by happy people, and ugly after being around people in a bad mood. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing. It is simple and makes them smile. But scientists usually say, ‘Give me a break’. 
I understand their point. The idea that water can be affected by thoughts is amazing, but we need good proof that it is true. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the movie’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties from a kind of energy that comes from nowhere, which is linked to a force that is making the universe expand. The evidence for this comes from many years of research in labs and observatories around the world. 
Scientists are making discoveries that show the universe is stranger than we thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of an unknown kind of matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy’. Other discoveries are also surprising. Neuroscientists found that our awareness of events happens half a second after they occur. This delay is not noticed because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans began and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even think there are links between life on Earth and the design of the universe. 
Despite what some people think, science is not finished. In fact, we seem to know less than before. Many natural events cannot be understood as we once thought. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some of the best theoretical physicists are trying to create a Theory of Everything, which would explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. But many of us believe the universe is best described in one word: incredible.'"
3,C2,"""Writing novels is a challenge for me, but writing short stories is a joy. If writing a novel is like planting a big forest, then writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which can turn bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies. This shows the change of seasons.
Since I started writing, I have often switched between novels and short stories. After I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. After I finish a group of short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write short stories while I am writing a novel, and I never write a novel while I am working on short stories. Writing these two types of stories uses different parts of my brain, and it takes time to change from one to the other.
I began my career with two short novels in 1975. From 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I did not know much about writing short stories then, so it was hard, but it was a memorable experience. I felt my imagination grow, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first short stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first collection called Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer.
One of the best things about writing short stories is that they do not take long to finish. Usually, it takes me about a week to write a short story, but I can spend a lot of time revising it. Writing a novel takes a year or two, and it can feel very long. Sometimes I wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change for me.
Another good thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas – a thought, a word, or an image. It feels like jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. You also do not have to worry about failing. If an idea does not work, you can just move on and remember that not every story can be perfect. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver have stories that are not perfect. This makes me feel better. I can learn from my mistakes and use that knowledge in my next story.
When I write novels, I try to learn from what works and what does not in my short stories. In this way, short stories are like a practice space for me as a novelist. It is hard to try new things in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder for me. My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like signs to my heart, and I am happy to share these feelings with my readers."""

Science is a way to understand the world. It helps us in many ways, like curing diseases, but it can also create problems. Science tries to explain everything, from tiny atoms to the universe. It has influenced many people, including poets and politicians. Sometimes, people do not understand science well, and its importance can be seen in different ways. 
Science is always changing. New ideas can replace old ones, and this can cause arguments among scientists. For example, in the past, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Now, scientists have new ideas that change how we see the universe. 
Famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein have helped us understand more about the world. Even though science makes mistakes, it keeps moving forward. In the late 1800s, many scientists thought there was not much left to discover, but then they found new things like radioactivity and the electron.
Today, some people believe we will soon have a complete theory that explains everything about the universe. Science is important because it affects our lives. We are not just watching nature; we are changing it. This means we need to pay attention to science and understand its effects on our future and the world our children will live in."

Since about 2015, many big book publishers have said that sales of ebooks have stopped growing or have even gone down. This has made people question if ebooks will be important in the future. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks may have led to bad investments, and his company lost faith in the value of printed books. Even though it seems that ebooks and printed books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This question is interesting and causes a lot of discussion. 
Why do we think about ebooks and printed books as if they are in a fight? The answers to this question tell us more about how we feel about new technology and change. In my research, I found that people often think one type of media will replace another when new technology comes out. For example, when television was invented, many people thought radio would disappear. But radio found new ways to be used, like in cars and factories. 
The idea that books might disappear is not new. In 1894, some people thought that the phonograph would replace books with audiobooks. This has happened many times with movies, radio, television, and smartphones. Some people worried that if books disappeared, culture would suffer. Others thought ebooks would be much better. 
The idea that books might die often comes up when new technology appears. This shows our mixed feelings about change. We form strong connections with different types of media, like books and computers. Many studies show that we can feel very attached to things, even naming our cars or getting upset when our laptops don’t work. 
When new technology, like e-readers, comes out, it changes our relationship with things we love. As technology changes, we often miss what we used to have. This is why some people still want older products. For example, when the printing press was invented in the 15th century, people wanted original manuscripts. When movies changed from silent to sound in the 1920s, people felt nostalgic for silent films. The same thing happened when photography changed from film to digital and from vinyl records to CDs. 
E-readers have made people appreciate the physical qualities of printed books, even their smell. This should make those who worry about printed books feel better. However, the idea that books might disappear will continue to be a popular story about technology and our fear of change. One way we deal with change is by using familiar stories, like those about loss and endings. The story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing things we love, including parts of ourselves.

Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some great thinkers from the last four hundred years did their best work. I wanted to show how they organized their time to be creative and productive. By writing about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to give a new view of their personalities and careers. 
The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.” I say, “Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.” This book is about the daily lives of creative people, not just their work. It is also personal. The writer John Cheever believed that you show something about yourself in everything you write. 
I have questions that I think about in my own life: How can you do creative work while also making money? Is it better to focus on one project or to work a little each day? When there is not enough time, do you have to give things up, like sleep or a clean house? Or can you learn to do more in less time? I do not have all the answers, but I want to show how many successful people faced similar challenges. 
The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I really focus on people’s routines. A routine can seem boring, but it can also help you use your time and energy better. The psychologist William James said that having good habits can help us focus on important things. Ironically, he was a procrastinator and could not keep a regular schedule. 
This book started because of my own procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, I was at my job at a small architecture magazine, trying to write a story that was due the next day. Instead of working, I was cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a “morning person” and can focus well in the morning, but I struggle in the afternoon. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I thought it would be good to collect these stories, so I started the Daily Routines blog that day, and now this book. 
The blog was simple; I shared people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I have gathered more information and tried to keep it interesting. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from their letters and diaries. In some cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. I want to thank the many biographers and journalists whose work helped me. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for further reading."

Howard wanted to be a palaeontologist since he was six years old. When he was a child, his father said they could not go on holiday to Spain because of money problems. Instead, they went to a beach in England. One day, Howard found an ammonite shell on the beach. He loved studying old creatures and decided he wanted to learn more about the past.
After finishing university, Howard was worried about finding a job. He felt he was good at his work, but he knew that sometimes good people do not get jobs. When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, he applied, but he did not expect to get it.
On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help him had a fight with his wife. He was upset and had an accident, so he could not come to the interview. Another professor, who did not like the first one, took his place. This professor helped Howard get the job, even though Howard did not know him well. Howard was happy to have the job, even if it was not for the reasons he hoped.
Howard enjoyed his work because he could plan and do his research. But sometimes, things in his personal life were chaotic. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes at a train station. Angry, Howard went back to the college, called to postpone his lecture, and reported the theft. 
While he was having coffee, he met a colleague who was with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This could be a great opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi. 
**Questions:**
1. Why did Howard want to be a palaeontologist?
2. What happened to Howard's holiday plans when he was a child?
3. How did Howard feel about finding a job after university?
4. What accident happened to the professor on the day of Howard's interview?
5. What did Howard learn about at the coffee meeting?"
8,C1,"'Charles Spence will eat almost anything. “We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,” says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. They may look like maggots, but they have a “slightly nutty, floral” taste. Spence and his team are trying to make eating bugs more acceptable. He studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. This research affects what we eat and drink, from big food companies to the menus of famous restaurants. Spence and his team study many details about how we experience food and drink. For example, who we eat with, how food is arranged, and even the color and weight of plates can change how food tastes. In his book, The Perfect Meal, written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, he shares interesting facts about food. Did you know that the person who orders first in a restaurant enjoys their food more? And we eat about 35% more food when we are with one other person, and 75% more when we are with three people? 
Spence’s lab in Oxford is simple. He says it is “low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff.” There are soundproof booths that look like big safes, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with cooks who do not have money for research. Much of his work is funded by a big food company. In the past, some people thought that research funded by companies was not real science. But now, universities need to show that their work is useful and interesting, so this type of research is important. Spence is helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. It is good for customers to stay healthy. Many companies have been making these changes quietly, so customers do not notice. “When you tell people what you are doing, they focus on the taste and often do not like it as much,” he says.
Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project for a big food company. At that time, people thought science and food did not go together, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal wanted to change this idea. Together, they created the “Sound of the Sea” dish in Blumenthal’s restaurant. Spence says that a long time ago, some artists were also trying to connect sounds with food, but it did not become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence’s research in many ways. For example, higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand made a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream melts, but they did not match the music to the taste.
What are dinner parties like at Spence’s home? One time, they ate rabbit with the fur around the cutlery. Another time, they played with colorful light bulbs. “We’ve had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and 10 different drinks to see if they have different sounds.” Home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international food conferences are all part of Spence’s work.'"

Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, like facts, rumors, and opinions, and we have to figure out what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things than before. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us find things in stores. Now, we do most of these things ourselves. We are trying to do the work of many people while also managing our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us with all of this. They are part of our busy lives, where we try to do as much as possible in every free moment.
But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, which means doing many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are really just switching quickly from one task to another. Each time we switch, it takes more effort. So, we are not like expert jugglers; we are more like people trying to keep many plates spinning, worried that one will fall.
Even though we think we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It can increase stress hormones in our bodies, which can make us feel confused or foggy. Multitasking can also make our brains crave new things, which distracts us from what we are trying to focus on. The part of our brain that helps us stay on task can easily be distracted by new things.
Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our ability to think clearly. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while seeing an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. He showed that multitasking can cause more problems than being tired. Another scientist, Russ Poldrack, found that learning new things while multitasking can send the information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information does not get stored properly. Without distractions, the information is stored better and is easier to remember.
Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to answer a text or ignore it. Making decisions is hard for our brains, and small decisions can use as much brain power as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can end up making bad choices about important things.
Many business leaders and scientists talk about the problem of too much information, especially emails. It is not that emails are bad, but the huge number of them can be overwhelming. When a 10-year-old boy was asked what his father does, he said, ""He answers emails."" His father agreed that this is true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and get anything else done.

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces. He threw these pieces at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they cannot find the right way to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think these questions were important. Animals had behaviors, and science studied these behaviors. The idea that animals have feelings and thoughts was not taken seriously. But now, this is starting to change. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals have emotions. This new idea is being discussed in popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s *Wild Justice* and Victoria Braithwaite’s *Do Fish Feel Pain?* 
This change has started a debate: do animals have thoughts and feelings? This leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food seemed happier than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we treat them? The facts are clear, but people have different opinions about them. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote *Second Nature*, believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks we are close to a big change in how we think about ethics, like when slavery was ended. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, believes we should think more about how animals think. He says animals might have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should not put human feelings onto animals. 
These three people may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but also philosophical. It is very hard to define what consciousness is. Can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an important experiment he did that seems to show that starlings, a type of bird, can feel sad. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with plenty of space and water. The other group lived in small, empty cages. At first, both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid bad worms from another. But when only bad worms were offered, only the starlings in nice cages would eat. Balcombe thinks that living in a bad cage made the starlings feel negative about life. 
Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, has strong opinions. He says, “We look back with disgust at a time of racism. One day, we will feel the same about how we treat animals. We cannot support animal rights while eating meat.” If he were the only one with this opinion, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning has written a textbook called *An Introduction to Animal Behaviour*. He says, “What we are seeing is a swing in ideas. In the early 20th century, some people thought animals thought like us, and then others disagreed. Now, we are starting to think differently again. But this is a complicated topic, and we should listen carefully to different opinions.”

Critical thinking is a way to understand better what we read or hear. Adrian West, a research director in the U.K., says that arguing can help us find the truth. Technology helps us store information and manage a lot of data, but it can also change how we think about complex problems. West points out that we see a lot of poor thinking and popular opinions that can confuse us. Even though we have more information, it does not always mean we have more knowledge or make better decisions. 
According to the National Endowment for the Arts, fewer people are reading books, and this is happening faster now. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media, like videos, can hurt our critical thinking. She says that people are more interested in quick media and doing many things at once instead of focusing on one thing.
There is still no clear answer about how technology affects critical thinking. Technology has changed how we think, and it can be both good and bad. For example, a computer game can help us think critically or make it harder. Reading online can improve our ability to analyze, but clicking on many links can stop us from thinking deeply.
Greenfield studied many research papers about learning and technology. She found that reading helps us think and use our imagination better than visual media like video games and TV. Reading helps us develop critical thinking and vocabulary. However, she also found that some visual media can help with processing information. Unfortunately, most visual media do not give us time to think or reflect.
Many young people do not reach their full potential because of this. How society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. There is a debate about video games and thinking skills. James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games are not always bad for kids. They can be a fun way to learn. Some studies show that playing games can help children become smarter and improve their reasoning skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in a fun way. These games allow players to explore ideas that they might not be able to in real life.
In today’s digital world, as reading and math scores go down, we need to look closely at technology and understand how it affects our thinking.

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after he became unhappy with working in an office and for social policy groups. His first book was about the good things about manual work. His latest book talks about how to deal with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he was shopping and saw ads on the credit card machine while he was entering his pin number. Crawford realized that it is hard to avoid these ads that take our attention. What we think about is personal, but we often cannot choose this because of things we do not notice. It is getting harder to think or remember conversations. Because people want to avoid being interrupted, they stop talking to strangers. Crawford says, “We see the world through things that are made for us, like video games and apps.” These things show our desires and take over our time. 
Crawford is not alone in his worries. Many office workers complain about emails but still check them in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make it hard to focus. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but people have worried about this since the telegraph was invented in 1837. It is clear that we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Some think this problem is only about technology, but Crawford believes technology helps us focus too much on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control ourselves, which affects our social lives. We often prefer to text friends instead of talking to them. Crawford argues that by only interacting with screens, we might lose important connections in society.
He gives an example from his gym. There used to be one music player for everyone, which could cause some disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds. “The gym used to be a social place, but it has lost that,” he says. Real connections often happen when people have different opinions and work through them together.
Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we need rules about noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he believes we should practice skills that help us engage with the world better. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real things. No video can replace the feeling of a hockey puck on ice or the gravel under your tires. These people use their good judgment and manage their space with others.
“When you engage with the world this way, fake experiences seem less important,” he says. This does not mean everyone should become a chef, but it is important to use your judgment. There are many benefits to this, including feeling satisfied with your work. Always fighting distractions can be tiring and make it hard to focus on what is important. Paying attention to one thing can help you pay attention to other things too.

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question in small talk. We often define ourselves by our jobs. But if you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit tricky. Saying you are a philosopher can sound a bit showy. It is okay to say you study or teach philosophy, but saying you are a philosopher can make people think you know something special that others do not. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. 
One reason people think this way is that philosophers often judge what others do and talk about thinking deeply. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of thinking was the best kind of life. Many modern philosophers do not agree, but people still connect philosophy with deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" This means that just going along with what everyone else thinks is not very satisfying. 
Thinking about our lives helps us make our own choices. But you do not need to read many books or think all the time to examine your life. It just means looking closely at your daily experiences to see if they are important. You do not have to be a wise person living away from society to do this. In fact, examining life can help guide our experiences, and sharing knowledge is important for a good life.
Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more separate from everyday life, especially for those who do not study it formally. This is not only the philosophers' fault; universities often focus on expensive journals and evaluations. Because of this, philosophers have little chance to share their ideas with anyone outside their small group of experts. For many people, philosophy can seem far away from real life. 
Some philosophers used to challenge this view, but many have stopped. The university system has created a situation where philosophers are isolated. As philosophy has become more focused on specific debates, it has become harder for those outside the field to understand. In some cases, philosophy has become disconnected from society. 
I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I work in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. Recently, I feel this title does not fully describe my work because ethics is often linked to rules and laws. There is a new way of thinking in ethics that looks at whether certain social practices are fair. The job of an ethicist today is to decide if something is ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions that I think about often.
A typical discussion might start by asking if downloading movies illegally is wrong (it is) and then move on to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and how consumerism affects us. Philosophy can help people think more about the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes we might find out something we already know; other times, we may realize our beliefs are hard to explain. By examining these ideas, we can do something good for everyone."

People who love food, like foodies and chefs, often think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, discussions about food have often been about other ideas instead. When philosophers talk about eating, they usually mean something else, like learning or knowledge. Sometimes, it seems like they are talking about food, but they are really discussing deeper ideas that are not directly about food.
One famous philosopher, Epicurus, believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. His name is now often connected with enjoying food and drink. You can see his name in restaurants and food shops because they think it will attract customers. Food is also social and cultural. The food we eat comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities help us grow and share food. We interact with food more than with any other product, which makes it an interesting topic to think about.
When food is ready, critics start to talk and write about it. But why do they have such a special role? One philosopher said that tasting food is not a special skill; food critics are just better at describing how food tastes. Most discussions about how we perceive things focus on sight, but taste has not been studied much. 
Another important part of food is its beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but we don’t usually say that about food. Some philosophers believe that, because of modern cooking, food should also be considered beautiful like art. However, food is eaten and gone, while art can last a long time. This makes it hard to say that food is truly beautiful.
There are also many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-GMO foods? Our answers often show our beliefs about what is right or wrong. Philosophers like to discuss these questions about food.
Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their friends and family. In a home kitchen, everyone shares food and time together. But restaurant cooks have to follow rules for their job and their food. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are more like colleagues than friends.
A recent essay called ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" looks at how food can help connect different cultures. We can learn to appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food. Also, when we eat together, we build friendships with people from other cultures. This idea has been important in international relations for a long time. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories that make food philosophy come alive for readers."

Rob Daviau is from the US and he designs special board games called ‘legacy’ games. He thought that the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. So, he began to think about how board games could change. He asked himself if board games could have a story and if choices made in one game could affect the next game. 
He changed a classic board game called Risk to create a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made by players during the game have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, change the board, or open new packets with different rules. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and players can hold grudges against each other. Daviau said, “You could point to the board and say: ‘Right here! You did this!’”
Later, he worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next game was called SeaFall. Pandemic Legacy was very popular, but many people thought SeaFall was a big test for legacy games because it was the first game that did not come from an earlier version. In SeaFall, players are sailors in the age of sail (16th to mid-19th century) and they explore a new world.
Designers of legacy games must think about all the choices players can make to keep the story interesting. They use play-testers to see how the games work. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester for SeaFall. He said, “It takes a lot of time. The first few games are great, but then it can start to break. You have to go back and fix everything.”
At first, legacy games were not expected to be very popular. Daviau thought it would only be interesting to a few people. He said, “I thought I would be known as the guy who did this weird project.” But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it is one of the best changes in game design in years. He said, “It’s a new level of commitment and excitement.”
Another fan, Ben Hogg, said that the fun of a new adventure was more important than worrying about how long the game would last. He mentioned that people don’t usually watch the same movie twice in the cinema. They want a new experience. Legacy games bring a story like video games do.
The legacy format is inspired by video games and popular TV shows. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a television writer, but he moved to advertising and then to game design. However, he still loves telling stories. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, said that making a legacy game is like writing a novel. “You need to know how you want it to end and where you want it to begin,” he said. 
Daviau feels proud of his work but is curious to see how others will use the idea. He thinks that soon gamers will want something new. Colby Dauch, the studio manager for SeaFall, believes that the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."

One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky climbed out of his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was exciting and was shared a lot online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think that animals are like us. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart and look very different from us. 
Octopuses can do many amazing things. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play games. Some scientists think that saying animals are like humans is not scientific. Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that we often ignore the human-like traits of animals. He calls this ""anthropodenial."" 
Dr. de Waal has studied animal intelligence for many years. He says that animals can think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand what others want. This means animals are smarter than we usually think. 
In the past, people believed that animals were smart. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 1800s, many scientists looked for similarities between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who changed how we see our place in the world, said that the difference between humans and animals is not so big. 
In the 20th century, people started to see animals differently. They thought animals only reacted to rewards and punishments. Many people who believed animals had feelings were seen as unrealistic. This change happened at the same time that humans were harming animal habitats and not caring for animals. 
Now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand animal intelligence better. He says that we are learning that animal thinking is similar to human thinking, even if they are not the same. He believes that we have learned a lot about animals in recent years. 
Dr. de Waal says that the best tests for animal intelligence should consider what each animal can do. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts. In her book, naturalist Sy Montgomery says that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us by how well we can change the colors of our skin. If we fail, it might think we are not very smart.
Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found a way to escape to the ocean. He thinks it is too hopeful to believe that Inky knew how to get to the drain. But he understands that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate animal intelligence. 
He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can feel envy. When the monkeys got cucumbers (which they like) or grapes (which they like even more), the monkeys who got cucumbers got very upset when they saw others getting grapes. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video of the experiment made people really believe the findings. This shows how our minds work in special ways.

Robots were once only in stories about the future, but now they are changing our world. Robots have been used in car factories and other industries for many years. Experts say that soon, robots will be used in many more areas, and many people are not ready for this big change. 
Many people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do in the next 50 years. However, about 80% of people believe their jobs will still exist in the same way. This is not true: robots will affect every job in the next few years. For example, an Australian company called Fastbrick Robotics has made a robot named Hadrian X. This robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, while two human workers would take a whole day to do the same job. 
Another example is a robot called Tally, made by a company in San Francisco. Tally walks around supermarkets to check if the shelves are full and the prices are correct. It does not clean the aisles, as some might think. 
Supporters of robots say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means there will be new jobs for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, some people worry that we need to keep the human touch in jobs. They believe society is not ready for the changes that robots will bring. 
Dr. Jing Bing Zhang is an expert on robots and their use in business. He studies how robots will change jobs in the future. His recent report says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and able to work with other robots and humans. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will create laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will go up by at least 60%, but many jobs will still be empty because there are not enough skilled workers.
Zhang says that robots will affect lower-skilled workers, which is sad. He believes that these workers should not wait for the government to protect their jobs. Instead, they should find ways to learn new skills. People cannot expect to do the same job for their whole lives anymore.
New technologies will create new types of robots for homes. These robots will be able to talk and interact with us in new ways, like the robots we see in science fiction. Zhang believes this is a great chance for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new rules to keep us safe.
With many jobs at risk, it is important to focus on education to prepare for the future with robots. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive.

1. What are robots changing in our world?
2. What can the Hadrian X robot do?
3. What does the Tally robot check in supermarkets?

5. Why do some people worry about robots taking jobs?
6. What should lower-skilled workers do according to Zhang?
7. What new types of robots will be created for homes?

18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it’s there."" This answer shows a common feeling: many people wonder why someone would want to do something so dangerous and difficult. Some people might feel inspired by his answer to follow their own dreams. Climbing can be about adventure and fun.
In 1967, a Bolivian writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He talked about seven different climbing activities, or ""games,"" from playing on small rocks to climbing high mountains. Each game has its own rules, and the way climbers choose to climb depends on these rules. Over the years, this idea has become popular in climbing discussions in the West, appearing in climbing magazines and conversations.
Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. However, climbing can also be very limiting. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not what most people think of as freedom. This creates a contradiction in climbing. But some people believe that having fewer choices can make life simpler and give a different kind of freedom.
When asked, ""Why climb?"" US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests asking, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is part of who we are as humans. We like to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it is risky. The joy we find in climbing is more about our nature than just thinking about it logically.
Another important idea comes from US academic Brian Treanor. He says that climbing can help us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these qualities, Treanor believes they are especially important in today's world, which often avoids risks. Climbing can help us grow and live better lives outside of climbing.
Some expert climbers, Ebert and Robinson, believe that climbing alone, without help from others or technology, is more challenging and deserves more recognition. They think that climbing independently is harder and riskier, but this idea has caused some controversy. It may encourage some climbers to take unnecessary risks.
We can also look at climbing from a different perspective. Many climbers talk about being in the moment or going with the flow. The physical effort of climbing, the focus needed, and the problem-solving involved are all key parts of the experience. Some people say that climbing is similar to Zen philosophy, which teaches how to calm the mind and find peace. This idea can help us understand why people are attracted to climbing."

For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel was very important in classical music. He was a serious person who played and recorded many famous European piano pieces. He wrote a lot of music but taught very few students. People who knew him saw a fun side to him, but he did not show this in his concerts. He spent his time studying, traveling, and performing.
About four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this seriously. He had very few students and did not want to start teaching now. He remembered a famous pianist saying, “You don’t ask a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.” But when he heard Kit play, he was impressed. Kit was about 14 years old and played very well from memory. He even gave Brendel a CD of his performance, which was beautiful. Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” 
As Brendel stops performing in public, Kit is starting to become known. Brendel is careful because he worries that Kit might burn out too quickly. Now 19, Kit is always busy. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, and plays tennis, all while his mother watches over him. He also composes music. Brendel says this is important because writing music helps you learn to read it better. He noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and can read music very well. Kit listens to his own playing and understands Brendel’s lessons. When Brendel tells him something to do in a piece of music, Kit can do it everywhere in that piece.
Brendel is careful not to raise expectations for Kit. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the great pianist of the 21st century. He thinks this is not good and can cause problems. Like many talented young musicians, Kit can play some things very well, but he still needs time to improve on others. It would be unfair if a critic expected him to be perfect.
Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed in his life after performing. He says, “When I was young, I did not want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I turned 50, I felt I had done most of those things, but I still wanted to do more, so I continued. Even though I cannot play like I used to, I still have many ideas in my head and pieces I have never played. I don’t perform now, but I enjoy this new part of my life.”"
20,B2,"""When I was little, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad’s garden was by a river. It sloped down to the water. You couldn’t touch the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a peaceful escape. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a big greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames with plastic covering broken glass. 
At home, my dad was quiet. He was not without humor. He liked to say funny phrases, like ‘It’s immaterial to me.’ He could have just said ‘I don’t mind,’ but he liked the word ‘immaterial.’ Deep down, he might have felt sad about his life. He left school without any qualifications and became a plumber. He didn’t love plumbing; it was just a job. He wasn’t very ambitious, but once he and my mum thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. 
My dad was good at fixing things around the house. He could build bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once. But my mum liked to change the furniture a lot. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano came into the house. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mum said they were too fancy, and they disappeared while I was at school. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister had lessons instead. When I asked my mum why I couldn’t play, she said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’
Of the three places to go – moors, woods, or river – I liked the river best. I could imagine another world there. With a fishing net, I would walk along the riverbank in my old sandals, looking for a good spot to take them off. I would leave my sandals with my picnic and look for fish in the water to catch. After trying to keep them alive in the yard, I had to put them back in the river.
I wanted to leave school quickly, but it seemed hard until one day my dad said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.’ In that moment, my dad surprised me. He might have preferred if I became a carpenter, but I think he hoped that I would do well as a gardener. Even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw how much I enjoyed it."""
21,B2,"'Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. A strong wind is blowing, and it feels like we could be blown off the cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and MacEwen gently pets him. The wind is loud, but MacEwen is calm and happy on his island. He shows me around and points to the north. “That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It gets a lot more rain than we do.” I see dark clouds over Rum’s big mountains. “Beyond Rum is the island of Soay.” 
Suddenly, MacEwen says, “I have sheep to move.” We walk down the hill. He tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and one and a half kilometers wide; the geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. While moving the sheep, Tie is not doing a good job. “Away to me, Tie. Away to me,” MacEwen says, meaning the dog should go to the right. But Tie goes straight through the sheep, causing confusion. MacEwen sounds disappointed. “That will never do.” Tie looks sorry.
The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son Colin takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in summer. “They go out and come back when they are hungry.” But life on the island has some challenges. For example, electricity is not always available. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary making breakfast with a flashlight. I also have no mobile phone service. “You can get a signal on the hill,” Mary says. “Most people last a couple of days without their phone.” So I do the same.
Everything on Muck feels special. A boat brings groceries and three musicians who come to play music. Their concert in the tearoom is very popular, and the islanders enjoy the music. That night, by the warm fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. “Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay from a newspaper ad without seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny went to manage it.” Did Jenny know how to run a farm? “She was good at typing.”
I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is very tasty. The next morning, I have to take a ferry to another island. Many ferries had been cancelled in the last two months because of rough seas. If my ferry does not come, I will be stuck on Muck for two more days. And secretly, I wish for that.'"

The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and self-taught people. Many thought video games were just a hobby for young people, but now the industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into this field. Making video games based on new movies needs many team members and a lot of skill and hard work. 
Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, says, “It is hard to get a job in big companies or to change big games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. They need not just the top people who manage the whole game, but also the people who design parts of the game.”
So, how can you start a career in this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a degree in computer science, but Jim thinks differently. He says, “The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made anything. Game design is not just a job; it is a way of life. You must create to be real.”
Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it is more complicated. “Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs. Even fewer have the creativity, skills, and vision to help the industry grow.” 
Can you work alone? “Maybe, but it is hard,” says John. “A good course in games can help you and give you support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and then move up. They are interested in all kinds of entertainment and culture. They may have worked for a few years after school but know that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and see many new possibilities.”
Connections can also help you get ahead in the game industry. This is often forgotten, but networking is important in many fields. 
The idea of a young boy playing video games all the time is changing. Now, many adults and families play games together. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. “Games are now enjoyed by many people. They are also a great way to learn, and I see many new opportunities in this area.”

23,B2,"""Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, and I am thankful for that. I had a friend who came to the park with us, but his dad was very strict. He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and has not played football since. I am happy that I still love football. 
When I score a great goal from far away, some people say it is just luck, but it is not. I have practiced taking shots at goal from a distance since I was a kid. You need to practice to score amazing goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice a lot. Sometimes young players bump into each other, but I learned the right way to play. When I teach kids, I always tell them to enjoy learning new skills.
At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that a good education is important, but football was my main focus then. The teachers did a good job, but I did not notice it at the time. I want my son to have a different experience. We are already trying to read him books, even though he is too young to sit still for long. I hope he does not just want to kick the books around like I did.
At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that young players like us could play for the first team. He did not make a big deal about it, but we all knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ This made us realize we had a lot to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.
I depend on my close friends and family. Having money can sometimes cause problems. People ask me why I let my mother keep working. I help my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they do not want to be treated like they need my money. My mum loves her job as a hairdresser, even if she does not earn much. I enjoy using my money to help the people around me.
I have a lot of money, but that does not solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off to do things I have not done for a long time. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I cannot do that now because if I break a leg while skiing and cannot play football again, I would not be insured."""

Sam Carter helped us move to Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. My father could not write anything while we lived there, so Sam offered to find us a cheap place to live. The beach at Reef Point was usually quiet because many people preferred to go to a nearby resort called La Carmella. But now, with the hot weather, many people came to the beach. 
My father was busy every day trying to write a script. I often went to the beach with my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we did not have a dog, but Rusty started to follow me. I tried to send him away, but he always came back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father did not really want him around, but Rusty kept getting closer. I asked my father, “Who does he belong to?” My father said, “He thinks we belong to him.”
Rusty loved the beach. He liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes he found things that did not belong to him, like a sneaker or a beach towel, and I had to give them back. Rusty also liked to swim with me, even though I could swim faster than him. 
One day, after swimming, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I stayed at the beach and watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and looked like they were having fun. One surfer was very good and caught my attention. She rode a wave and then came to talk to me. 
“Hi! Why didn’t you join us?” she asked. 
“I don’t have a surfboard,” I replied. 
“You could get one,” she said. 
“I don’t have any money.” 
“Are you British? Are you visiting?” 
“No, I live here.” 
“Is your father American?” 
“No, he came here to write a film script from a novel he wrote.” 
“Really? What’s his name?” 
“Rufus Marsh.” 
“Do you mean ‘Tall as the Morning’?” 
I nodded. 
“I read that book!” she said, looking at me with interest. I felt happy because people were friendly when I talked about my father’s book."

""What have I done?"" Violet Hetherington asked herself. She was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton. The line was outside the building marked ‘Departures’, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. No one was moving. Her friend Annie had told her, ""It’s best to get to the docks late. If you arrive too early, you will just wait."" Annie was married to a diplomat and traveled a lot. But this time, her advice was not good. 
After a while, an announcement came over the loudspeakers: there was a problem with the computer system. The mood of the waiting passengers became worse. Some tried to be patient, and a few even tried to be cheerful, but most people were unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip. This might be their last chance for a nice vacation. The fact that they could not board the ship quickly made them feel worse. Violet wanted to leave. 
She checked her bag for her phone and realized it was missing. This was more annoying than the long wait. It made her feel that going on a cruise was a mistake. Now she had the problem of the missing phone. She could not call the taxi company to see if she left it in the taxi because the number was in her phone. Her older son Harry always told her to avoid this mistake. 
Behind her in the line, there was a friendly couple. ""I’m sorry, but I think I left my mobile phone behind. Can I borrow yours to make a call?"" Violet asked. She called Harry on their phone and left a message for him to ask her neighbor, Kristina, to check if the phone was at her flat. If it was not there, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, ""Thank goodness,"" but she did not tell Harry this. Harry thought he was more experienced than his mother. Daniel, her younger son, was more understanding of her mistakes, but that was because he made the same ones. Dan might forget to give the message to Kristina.
Finally, the line started to move, and Violet went to a window where she gave her travel documents and got ready to board. Her heart sank when she entered the ship’s lobby. It looked like a fancy hotel that was not very good. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, shiny brass, and carpets like those in airports. Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’, which were full of mirrors and crowded with tired passengers. They might have preferred not to see their reflections. 
Violet was pressed against the side of the lift as it went up, stopping at each floor to let people out. At last, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out and felt free. And, thankfully, her room had the balcony she had asked for. She had been worried about what to say if it did not. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a better deal, she had decided to pay the highest price she could afford to make sure she had a nice view of the sea."

John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park, a neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Vivian Maier, a street photographer. Since then, Maloof has collected many things about her life and work. In his home, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with some 8mm movies and audiotapes.
One morning, Maloof looked around at all the items. He felt he was close to something special, and it happened by chance. He said, “When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was. I could have just sold it all to someone else.” Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families who hired her as a nanny and to people who developed her film.
Vivian Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always had a camera with her. She wore big coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier, said, “On her day off, she always had her camera. We wouldn’t see her until late at night.” Maier had strong opinions about movies and politics and knew a lot about theater and films. 
Even though she was not very social, she walked the streets with her camera and talked to people. She loved documenting the world around her. Rydzon said, “She was a true artist and followed her dreams.” Maier’s work was not for money; it was pure art. She took pictures of women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. Photography expert Larry Silverman said, “Vivian has many interesting pictures.” He wonders if she created her own style or learned from other photographers.
Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever go through all the negatives he has stored in three fireproof cabinets. He did not care much about photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, he started taking his own pictures. He said, “I realized that the people and street scenes were more important than I thought. I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make Vivian Maier known and get her into the history books.”"

When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it did not succeed completely. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I spoke with her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control. The officer asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to him. The officer looked at it and asked, “What is it about?” This is not an easy question for a writer. 
The Luminaries takes place in New Zealand during the 1860s. There are many crimes, and a group of 12 men is trying to solve them. The story becomes very complicated. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but she found that the past gave her many chances to create problems for her characters. The book is more than 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good story. 
When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said, “It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. People at home are very supportive.” She also said, “What annoys me is when people think my book is not serious.” 
Catton wanted to write the book in a spiral shape. Each part is half the length of the part before it, so the story speeds up as it goes. I asked her if it matters if readers notice this. She said, “I wanted to create patterns in the book that don’t matter, but if you care, you can find them.” 
Even with its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery. Surprisingly, Catton did not know how the story would end before she wrote it. She said, “I would write myself into a corner and then see how I could get out of it.” She wanted to make the book fun for readers. 
We also talked about her love for TV dramas. I asked if she would like to write for television. She said, “That could be pretty cool.” She was very excited when talking about her work and New Zealand. She said, “When I come to Britain, my imagination changes because I am in a different place. I understand why writers leave New Zealand for busy cities to be around more people.” But for now, New Zealand will still be her home. I hope it gives her inspiration for many more novels."

When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has built acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny loves the guitar. He wonders how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound. He learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of saving money for one, he decided to make it himself. He studied how different shapes and types of wood change the sound of the guitar.
Jonny built his first bass guitar, but he did not think about making guitars as a job at that time. He also liked painting and sculpture. After school, he studied architecture at university because he liked design. But halfway through, he left because he wanted to do something different. He realized that making guitars is like making sculpture, but with sound. He thought it was a good idea because people use the guitars he makes.
Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows to earn extra money. At first, he sold his guitars for the cost of materials, but later he became known as a good guitar maker and could charge more. Even now, after almost forty years, he says he is still just getting by. He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income.
In the beginning, Jonny worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals and let musicians try his guitars. He also had to learn how to price his guitars because he didn’t think about money much. Jonny believes it is easier for new guitar makers today in the UK. When he started, many people thought only American-made guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are respected.
Jonny thinks new guitar makers should take courses to learn valuable skills. However, he also believes that learning by trying and making mistakes is important. He says it is good to look at other instruments and see what works and what doesn’t. If you make the back of a guitar too thin or too thick, it will not sound good. If you learn from someone else, you may only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, you can learn many things."

When people talk about English conversation, they often start with the weather. A famous writer from the 1700s, Dr. Johnson, said, “When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather.” This is still true today. Many people try to explain why the English talk about the weather so much, but they often get it wrong. They think that English people talk about the weather because they are very interested in it. 
The American writer Bill Bryson says that the English weather is not interesting. He points out that in other places, there are exciting weather events like tornadoes and big storms, but these are rare in England. The English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson. He believes that English weather is interesting because it is always changing. He says that even if there are no big storms, the weather is still important because it is never completely predictable.
I think both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point. When English people talk about the weather, they are not really talking about the weather. They use weather talk as a way to connect with each other. For example, when someone says, “Nice day, isn’t it?” or “Ooh, isn’t it cold?” they are not really asking about the weather. These phrases are just ways to start a conversation or fill a pause.
There are specific times when people use weather talk. Some people say that the English talk about the weather all the time, but that is not true. Weather talk is used mainly in three situations: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is a pause in the conversation. Because of this, it may seem like English people talk about the weather a lot. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, then move to other topics, and return to the weather when there is a silence. This is why many people think that English people are obsessed with the weather."

Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested in this trip instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. But they wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice felt her answers were not good enough. 
She could not find a good historical novel about life at the Wall in Roman times, so she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as a writer in 2001. She felt nervous but excited about this big change. Alice said, “Teaching is like acting. It is very demanding. Writing is exciting, but it is not so tiring. My old teaching friends are jealous because I still connect with children through my stories.”
Alice wants her books to fill a gap in children’s fiction. She thinks many books for teenagers today talk about sad experiences. “They are well written,” she said, “but they are often dark. My books are different.” Alice always tried to teach English and History together. She loved to see when a child goes from being bored to interested. “I enjoy having bored children because it is a challenge for me to make them interested,” she said.
Alice started writing her first novel because she saw a need for it. She was also inspired by her head teacher, who suggested she take a creative writing course. At first, Alice did not want to do it. She had been teaching for 25 years and thought the course was not necessary. But before the course, she had to send her best story to the teachers. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours and 30 pages, she sent it in and was accepted.
During the course, other students read her story and gave her good feedback. They suggested she publish it. With only 8,000 report cards to show her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor. He helped her a lot with editing the novel. Alice said, “My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but I think we help each other. He changes the sentences and suggests better words. I like to add more scenes. That is the difference between a fiction writer and an editor.”

To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would have Jonny in a car and Alistair on a mountain bike. They would race in the beautiful and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England. Jonny would drive on the roads, while Alistair would ride across the countryside.
“I’m excited!” Jonny said at the start line. “I’ve never done this before. The views are beautiful, and it’s cold, so I will be warm in the car.” Alistair was also excited, but he wore warm cycling clothes. “I’ve seen Jonny drive before,” he said. “I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for tea on the way.”
The race started at Semerwater lake and would finish at Fleet Moss, which is the highest road in Yorkshire, about 350 meters up. This was easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill first. They quickly shook hands and then started the race. Alistair rode fast on his bike, while Jonny got in the car and drove off. The question was, who would finish first?
Jonny’s confidence dropped quickly. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he saw a big tractor on the road. “Welcome to Yorkshire,” he said to the cameraman. “If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!” After getting past the tractor, Jonny drove on. Meanwhile, Alistair was having a hard time with the hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the slope, while sheep watched him.
Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. The sun came out, and he started to ride faster. In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The roads in Yorkshire are old and narrow. He had to drive slowly around a tight corner and through a small stream on the road. After leaving the last village, Jonny drove straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close they were to each other.
As Jonny drove fast to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road. He pushed hard and then stopped suddenly at the finish line. “Is he here?” he asked the crowd. “No? Really?” He raised his arms in joy. “Yes!” A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car and got out. “Well done,” he said to Alistair, looking disappointed. “I’m sad.”

32,B2,"'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The nice grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all make you feel safe from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. What I find hardest in a tennis match is to focus only on the game and the point I am playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me. I am so focused that I don’t realize there are millions watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me from a young age that this was the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was dreaming with my friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not so hard. I was just happy to be there at twenty years old. Federer beat me easily. But my loss in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have played better. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, my tough coach, usually does not comfort me, but he told me there was no reason to cry and that there would be more Wimbledons. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might be my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete's career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments are more important, and I had let a big one go in 2007. There was nothing Toni could do to help me feel better. But he was right in the end. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my loss. The best sign that I was ready was that I believed I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we did not talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to talk about it, but they understood that I was already thinking about the match in my mind. From then until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone.'"
33,B2,"'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in April 1957. In her first letter home, she wrote, “I am living in the Africa I have always wanted.” She spent most of her life in Africa as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Jane became famous when Britain’s National Geographical Society published articles and made television shows about her research on chimpanzees. She also wrote popular books, including children’s books and the bestseller In the Shadow of Man, which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. However, her fame sometimes makes people forget her real achievements. Many articles and interviews tell her life story, but they often focus on her adventures and not her important work. Jane Goodall should be recognized for her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees. She helped us understand their social and emotional lives. Before her work, people thought wild chimpanzees were very dangerous, but they misunderstood the risks. No one knew that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We also did not know that chimpanzees have emotions similar to humans and that their social lives are like ours. Jane’s book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), is the most important work on chimpanzee research. Her long study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered a great scientific achievement. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves as humans. Even as a child, Jane showed signs of becoming a biologist. When she was five years old, one autumn day, she disappeared. The police and her family searched for her. After a long search, she came back with straw in her hair and clothes. Her mother asked where she had been. Jane said she wanted to know how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours until she got her answer. This moment can be seen as the start of her career as a biologist.'"

In our first conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using different voices. She sounds like a funny 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Many people know her voices from children’s TV shows and cartoons. “I just did a voiceover about back injuries,” she says. “I had to learn how to say many medical words quickly.” 
Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. “Many actors think they can do funny voices, and some can,” she says. “But it is more than that. You have to make the script exciting for people who cannot see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions, but they often do not get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.”
After school, Shirley took a drama course. She wanted to be an actor. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. “One day,” she says, “the man at the recording studio asked me to try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and got the part!” Shirley discovered she could do voices and thought voiceover work might be good for her. “Things just happened for me,” she says. “In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character, her brother, and her mother.”
Adult women often do the voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are higher than those of men. There are many rules and forms to follow when hiring child actors, which production companies want to avoid. Shirley has learned to make different sounds and to not always sound the same. She collects new voices by watching children’s TV. 
Cartoons are the best part of her job, which also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. “Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my experience helps,” she says. “I learned that smiling while you talk makes your voice sound happy.” When she works on animation, it feels like a holiday because she enjoys working with other actors.
The competition for voiceover work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording that shows what an artist can do – is very important. “It’s worth making a strong showreel,” Shirley says. “There are agencies that help voiceover artists create them.” She believes she is successful because of her hard work and talent. “Whether it’s making your showreel or practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.”
For anyone who wants to do voiceovers, Shirley suggests going to special workshops that teach different types of voiceover work. She also thinks it is important to love human sounds. She describes herself as someone who is very interested in voices and becomes the characters she plays. “If I’ve been in the studio doing an American voice, for example, I might talk like that for hours or even days,” she says. “My children are used to me talking in different voices.”"
35,B2,"'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This is normal because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people stop dreaming and choose more practical jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do it. 
Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I had a typical childhood for a cartoonist. I loved comic strips, drew for school papers, and was known as ""the kid who draws."" I studied graphic design in college and after I graduated, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons about local issues. I created some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to support myself.
You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it was that easy, there would be many more cartoonists. The skills needed to be a cartoonist are not hard to learn, but it is still a tough job. You should only try to be a cartoonist if you feel you cannot do anything else. It is easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family and hobbies.
The more skills you have, the better chance you have to make a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also written, drawn caricatures, and sometimes designed. I take any job because you can learn a lot from work you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.
What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs with different newspapers and magazines. But now, most cartoonists have to be entrepreneurs. This means you not only create the work, but you also have to sell it. The more comfortable you are with selling, the better you will do. I have seen cartoonists with average drawing skills but great business skills do much better than those who are very talented but don’t know how to sell their work.
Many people worry about someone stealing their ideas, even if they have never sold a cartoon. Some are so scared that they won’t let anyone see their work! To protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it is more likely that no one will care about your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it is not a disaster – it can actually be a lucky break!'"

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out my things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar from Japan. I usually don’t like to throw things away, so I was surprised that I wanted to get rid of it. I took it to the dump and was about to put it in the trash when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and said, “You’re not going to throw that away, are you?” I told him I was, and I started to feel sad. He asked if he could have it, and I said “Yes.” After that, I felt very sad about giving it away.
A few months ago, I opened an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean. Ten years later, he found it in a fish he was eating. That’s how I felt when I read an email from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes and sells guitars. He told me, “I have your electric guitar.” It had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name on a label on the guitar and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy! I would have given him anything for it, but his price was fair.
I remembered how my dad liked to put name labels on my things, including my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar because it was popular in the 1970s. I loved the sound of it; it was calming and gentle. But I didn’t get better at it, so I switched to electric guitar and played easier songs. At that time, punk music was also popular, and anyone could be a rock star, even if they didn’t play well.
When I opened the box that Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave me the guitar. It felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I sat down to play, but then I wanted to stand up and put a strap on my shoulder because electric guitars are played while standing. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands knew what to do. My fingers felt a little pain from pressing the strings to play a chord. 
Electric guitars are usually played in a band. Now that I am learning again, I think I should form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves “The Regainers”!"

There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote the book Insomniac, about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep can affect our minds, bodies, and feelings. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is. It is good that sleep is getting more attention now. But what about dreams? I have not heard much about dreams in this discussion. We are losing dreams all the time. When you wake up early because of an alarm, you miss the last hour or two of sleep. This lost sleep is mostly REM sleep, which is the stage of sleep when we dream the most. Our best and most memorable dreams happen in REM sleep just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. So, if a person lives for 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM sleep. When researchers take away REM sleep from people, they have more REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This shows that dreams are important. 
In 1953, researchers found REM sleep. Many people agreed with the psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams was the best way to understand our minds. But later studies showed that it is not that simple. Now, researchers focus more on the physical reasons for dreams rather than the psychological ones. According to Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University, there is not much agreement among dream researchers. 
Dreams are important. At a meeting of sleep experts, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study. This study found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. Pagel believes that people who are interested in being creative use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wonder, do only creative people use their dreams? Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? 
Stickgold says that dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways. They help us find new patterns and make connections that we do not usually see. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to think of something related to a word, their answers are more original than when they are woken from other sleep stages. They think of unexpected ideas that make sense in a different way. This is what creativity is. I find that I write better when I wake up from strong dreams. Even a bad dream can help me think better. On those days, my ideas come out quickly, and I can hardly keep up with my typing. I do not know how it works, but it does help. 
Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complicated world. Everyone needs their brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small town by the sea in south-west England. When you enter her studio, you see many empty frames on the walls and pictures of her two daughters. Susie is a talented copyist artist. She can copy famous paintings from the early 20th century and the 16th century very well. “I don’t keep my own paintings,” Susie says. “As soon as I finish them, I sell them.” 
Susie is very popular. In her 30 years as a copyist, she has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts sometimes think they are the real paintings. While the original paintings can sell for millions of pounds, her copies sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she works on them. 
Susie does not share the names of her clients, but they include art galleries and private collectors. Some collectors love art, but others want to show off their paintings. One famous buyer likes to say he has a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. “Many famous people pretend my copies are the originals,” she says. “That’s their choice.” Some collectors keep the original painting in a bank and show Susie’s copy at home.
Susie is honest about her work. When she copies a famous painting, she tries to make it look as real as possible. She believes that doing a bad job would be unfair to the original artist. However, she puts her signature on the back of her paintings. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real painting, and even though some people make money that way, Susie has never wanted to do that. People who make fake art often get into trouble. 
Susie is not rich, and she has had hard times, but now her life is more stable. She does not want to risk her good name with collectors and artists. Susie did not always copy paintings. After finishing her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She earned very little money, but it helped her learn important skills. She had to be very careful and get things right the first time. She is happy she found a job that pays better.
When young artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and to be accurate. She has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants and make copies of old paintings, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie thinks many people believe modern art is easy. However, she knows that impressionists painted quickly but also paid attention to detail, which is very hard to do.
Some people wonder why Susie does not create her own art. Isn’t art about expressing yourself? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? Susie says her work comes from years of practice, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried to create her own art before. Once, she painted fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. 
Susie is a perfectionist, and she wants everything to be just right."

Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything else when she was a racer. She wanted to be the fastest person on the water. Since she was a child, the sea was her big passion. She felt a special connection with her boats. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, life felt boring. People wanted to know about her races, but she just wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging nature, even in places that were very dangerous for her.
After she finished second in a big race called the Vendée Globe, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She took me into the tiny cabin where she lived for 94 days. She talked about how she planned everything carefully, even how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. She said preparation was very important. She proudly showed me her food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical supplies. She took great care of her boat because her life depended on it.
Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small and beautiful, but also fragile. She had a big change in her thinking when she visited South Georgia, a lonely island in the south Atlantic. There, she helped with a study of albatross birds. This experience made her think differently. She saw many old whaling stations and felt it was a warning. She realized that people often take what they want and then leave.
When I visited Ellen at her office, she was finishing a busy phone call. She told me why we need to act now to save the planet. She said that coal, oil, and gas are precious resources that we cannot make again. We need to find ways to use less. At first, she focused on using less, but then she found a better way to think about it. Now, she talks about re-using things, like special carpet tiles that can be used again.
For the last three years, she has been visiting factories and talking to people in government and business about our need for renewable resources. She said, “I will never be an expert, but I love learning new things. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Sailing felt selfish compared to this work. It is important to find out how I can help.”
Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a sustainable future. She said, “I miss the adventure of being at sea. It is part of who I am. When I am sailing, I feel connected to everything. I don’t feel lonely. I focus on my goals and survival. My new message is not as simple as saying, ‘I want to be the fastest around the world.’ I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I have done.”"

Many famous climbers think it is not a good idea to take a 13-year-old up Mount Everest. They believe that while Jordan may be strong, he might not be emotionally ready. They also think he may not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, ""I know people criticize us, but we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is getting stronger and more mature.""
I wonder if Jordan wants to climb because of his father's dreams. Paul says, ""This is not about me wanting to be famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought about climbing later in life, but we decided, 'Why not now?' We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it."" When I ask Jordan why he wants to climb, he says, ""I just focus on reaching my goal.""
In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest climber. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is a chance to set a record. This creates a problem for Jordan. Some people think that trying to achieve records takes away the fun of climbing. But if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his journey online, take photos, and give interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, ""If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym."""

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they look confused. I just started a music degree, but my classmates know as little about classical music as other teenagers. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t have any of their recordings. This is sad for people who love classical music. Last year, only 3% of concert tickets sold were for classical music, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe.
So, why are fewer people interested in classical music? Older people often blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that is the reason. The truth is that classical music does not attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I don’t really like classical music. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music listening is probably close to that 3% number.
Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, classical music has many changes in mood and rhythm, which can be hard for us. We like fast talking, fast playing, and fast thinking. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but just right for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Also, pop music talks about things that matter to teenagers, while classical music often does not.
The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely hear classical music in our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a store? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I don’t think many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but when I look at the audience, I mostly see older people. I don’t know why more middle-aged people like classical concerts, but if your parents love something, you might want to avoid it.
Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play classical music in their school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they play it, but it is not their favorite music. Playing and listening to music have become different activities. When we want to relax, we always choose pop music. 
**Questions:**
1. What type of music do most teenagers listen to?
2. How many concert tickets sold last year were for classical music?
3. Why do teenagers find classical music hard to enjoy?
4. What do teenagers prefer to listen to when they want to relax?
5. Do many teenagers go to classical music concerts?"

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. “I will make you sorry I came here,” she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the other door, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hill; it was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gym, riding center… “Riding center,” said Bonnie, suddenly interested. “Headmaster’s study,” said her mother. “This way.” Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. “I wish you would walk beside me instead of behind me like a dog,” said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do it. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. “Why should I just sit here?” she said to herself. “I will be thrown out soon anyway,” she said to the door, “so why not just go?” She left the building and went to the riding center, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She walked carefully to the horses. Bonnie treated horses with respect. The horses were well cared for, and she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one. “I know what you are doing here,” she said to a small pony, touching its nose. Then she saw the next horse and stopped. “But aren’t you the best!” she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. “I feel like we have met before,” she said, stroking his neck. “It was in my dreams, and I was riding you to win a big competition…” Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride the horse. “I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,” she thought. The room with the riding equipment was unlocked. Happy to put a saddle on Maverick, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. “You are the best horse I have ever ridden, Maverick,” she said. “I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else.” She nudged him to walk, then to trot. “If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,” she said. She went around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and a little breeze made her cheek feel warm. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,B2,"'I have met Cody Simpson before, and I was impressed by his quiet confidence. Cody is a 15-year-old boy from Australia. He has already released many successful songs. How did a relaxed surfer end up on stage in front of many fans? Cody says, “I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven.” He remembers that he was swimming and surfing every day. These activities were very important to him. When he was 13, he was in high school and posted some videos online. 
These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans wanted to see more videos on social media. So, Cody recorded more videos at home, and the responses were amazing. Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with great coaches and focused on swimming. But then, record labels contacted him, and he had to make a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming or take a big risk by moving to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the risk. 
He said, “It was very difficult for me to choose a career at such a young age. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 years old and trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life?” He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. “It surprised most people. I’m the quiet kid,” he remembers. “I’m modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world.” 
So, Cody packed his bags and moved with his family to another part of the world, giving up one dream to try to make another dream come true. His family stays out of the spotlight and does not work directly in his career, but they support him. Cody believes it is important to have good people around you to stay grounded. 
Everyone has days of doubt. “Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old, and he travels the world and does school on the road. He doesn’t have a regular life,” Cody admits. “I worry about him sometimes, but my family always supports me in everything I do.” 
Success in any career comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big chance, even when it is scary. “It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,” Cody says. “Now, I go to countries I never thought I would visit and play in front of many fans. It is something many people dream of. But I know it won’t last forever.”'"

I jumped out of bed, pulled back a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I squinted and looked upstream at the sandbags. They were there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags. Last week, I worked with many people in the town for long hours to help. My grandfather did not notice much. 
With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the dark water from the factory in Milltown. There was thin ice on both sides, and the dark water was followed by solid ice. As I took off my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I did not know him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and put on my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather gave me from a trip to South America. This chain is special, and only my grandfather, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen. 
“Good morning, Rex,” my mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I will make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 
“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into my tall grandfather as he came out of his room. 
“Can’t you watch where you’re going?” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 
“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” It was clear because I was wearing my wetsuit. Grandpa is sometimes hard to deal with, and he has been more difficult lately. 
“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He walked away and slammed the bathroom door. My mom came over with a kind smile. 
“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 
“...not himself right now,” I finished for her. I wanted to say he was always like this, but I kept quiet. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me pictures of himself in National Geographic magazine. Those old pictures still hang on his wall, above his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies to look at, and maybe one day, my own picture in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay close to him, even if he is grumpy. 
Mom smiled. “At least he is coming out of his room more. Have a good training session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even on these cold days!” 
I smiled back as I peeled my banana. “It will be warmer in South America,” I said. “If I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."

Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. “Come with me,” she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was a painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa’s, but it looked different and was not finished. “Do you know anything about this?” Mum asked. Jess shook her head. “I’ve never seen it before. I didn’t know he was working on anything.” 
Jess looked at the painting. There was a river in it, but it was not a river she knew. It looked like a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a spooky way. The riverbank was very small, with a little green that was hard to see. The eye was drawn to the pale water and a hidden sea. There were no animals, no birds, and no people. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after a long summer. 
Mum spoke again. “It has a name.” There was something in her voice that showed her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others think about them. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. “River Boy.” The words felt important to her, but she didn’t know why. 
Then Jess noticed something. She looked at Mum. “There is no boy.” 
“Exactly. It’s strange, isn’t it? For him to be so specific. But maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.” 
“Mum! You should have known better.” 
“I know, but I couldn’t help it. It’s such an unusual painting, especially with a name. You can guess what he said.” 
Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would say. “He told you it’s not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, just like a poem. We either understand it or we don’t. And he said painting is hard work without having to explain it to everyone.” 
Mum laughed. “Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him.” 
“Inspire?” 
“Someone who helps an artist.” Jess knew what it meant. Grandpa often said it when she watched him paint, but he never said it was about her. She thought he meant a goddess, not a real person. It was hard to think anyone could inspire someone as stubborn as Grandpa. “He doesn’t need me to inspire him,” she said. “He’s been painting all his life.”"

This morning, I woke up and did not mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I am not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand, the knife might have gone into the carpet and made a big hole. I did not mean to damage the carpet. I did not wake up and think, “Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.” It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but by then it was too late. This happens to me a lot. 
What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is very cute! It is small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran kept china ornaments in there. I keep my shells and stones there. Gran knew I loved her corner cabinet, and I was very happy when she gave it to me! 
The cabinet is a corner cabinet, so it is shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. My bedroom is the smallest room in the house, and it is shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the back one is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and my room is very small. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I will be in my small room for a long time. 
I do not mind; I like my little bedroom. It is cozy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is, there are not many corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet into the space between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. Then I thought, if I cannot cut the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like a good solution. Dad always tells us to “think outside the box.” That is what I was trying to do!"
47,B2,"'The novel ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They ""borrow"" things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV show based on the book, I knew it would be hard to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn’t want people to say I did it wrong. The author wanted the show to show the story from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans' view, which made filming more difficult. 
The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans. So, when we filmed the Borrowers walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be ten times further away than usual. When filming the human world around the Borrowers, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They went through many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for some special shots. 
One big challenge was to make the shadows look right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized background. We created a special way to do this. After the show was on TV, famous director George Lucas called me to ask how I did it. The only set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, filled with big objects to make the actors look small. It was very strange. When I asked them to carry big things like giant scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins – they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much. 
In the story, there is a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to go down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary that they didn’t have to act. It was important to me to get the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they looked like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to move. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor wore trousers made from a rug because normal fabric would look too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don’t think they were happy with me for the costumes!
Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t really there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I drew 2,000 by the end. They weren’t perfect, but they worked. We didn’t have enough money to use special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once filmed a whole scene and then realized there was no film in the camera! But in the end, everything came together, and I think the show was successful in showing the magic of the books.'"
48,B2,"""Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, searching for reporters that are not there. I know the craziness will start soon. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be my friends, and the ones who ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. ‘Everything will be fine,’ I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone at this new school. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school because I want to meet normal kids. Kids with parents who have regular jobs, like working in an office or cutting grass. That would be so cool. 
I walk into the school office. ‘Hi, I need my schedule, please,’ I say to the secretary. ‘Name?’ she asks, looking unfriendly. ‘Desert McGraw.’ ‘Desirée?’ she asks, leaning closer. ‘Desert,’ I say again. The secretary looks confused. ‘Oh,’ she says and types ‘McGraw’ on her computer. That’s good because not many people know my last name since my dad uses a stage name. ‘What grade?’ she asks. ‘Eleventh.’ ‘One moment, it’s printing,’ she says. Then she rips the paper and gives it to me. English Literature, first period. Great, I like English. But I will be late. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look silly searching for my classes. 
When I reach the door, I hear the teacher calling names. ‘Aurelio Gonzalez.’ ‘Here.’ I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. ‘Nice shoes,’ she whispers. I look down at my fancy shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. ‘Thanks,’ I say. The teacher pauses. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says carefully. ‘Here.’ The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we look at them, she lets us talk! All teachers should do this. 
‘So why did you move here?’ my new friend asks. I have many answers. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason my dad gave? ‘We need a change, Desert,’ he said, ‘and this is the best place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.’ I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a studio close to the sand? ‘My dad had to move,’ I tell her. Yes, lies are easier. ‘What does he do?’ she asks. Oh well. Everyone will find out soon. But I can pretend to be normal for a while. ‘He’s an artist,’ I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ‘Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.’ And she doesn’t seem to care. Great."""

Today, many American teenage girls are expected to be the president of the Student Council. They also need to have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in school. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average; they need to do more. If they do not try hard, people think they are lazy.
Kristen Loose, a teenager, says, “Adults often forget how much pressure we have. We have a lot of homework, tests, after-school activities, jobs, chores, and we also want to have a social life.” Even with all this stress, people still have negative ideas about teenagers. They think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, loud, and only care about themselves. While some teenagers may act this way, Kristen believes it is not fair to say all teenagers are like this.
Kristen uses her cellphone a lot, but not just for fun. She uses it to help with her schoolwork and to stay in touch with people. Today, students can do their homework anywhere because of smartphones and tablets. They can listen to lessons while going to school. Schoolwork does not stop when they leave school; it takes a lot of their time.
Many teenagers wake up around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often go to bed after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They usually do not get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school once a week because they are tired.
Lindamarie Olsen, another teenager, says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. She does not spend her free time on social media or watching TV. Instead, she likes to volunteer. Lindamarie says, “People think teenagers only care about themselves, but I love helping others. I want to make a positive difference in my school and community.”
In the future, the ideas about teenagers may change, but they will continue to show that these ideas are wrong and make the world a better place. There will always be new students who are doing great things before they finish school.

The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a small mountain town in the US. This town is surrounded by wild nature, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the last few years, this group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long science project that is also an adventure, which is why many teenagers join. 
I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to try to see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and makes a bright light. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer to check the temperature as the balloon went up. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside of the lunch box to find it later. 
A gas tank, given by a friend from another state, was used to fill the balloon with gas. The balloon slowly grew to the size of a small car. An older boy drove for seven hours to get the gas tank. “I didn’t really mind,” he said. For kids in this club, this is normal. 
Finally, it was time for the balloon to go up. “Five, four, three, two, one,” they counted down, and the balloon started to rise. Some of them ran and followed it with bright flashlights until they could not see it anymore. There was a quiet feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night sky. 
After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky. It was hard to believe they were only four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. “We’re the only ones talking,” said one girl quietly. “I know,” whispered another. 
A meteor shot across the sky. As the balloon rose, the air pressure changed, and the balloon got bigger until it popped with a loud sound. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. 
Finding the lunch box was not easy, but that was part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. “Recovering the lunch box is a big part of the project,” said the group’s leader. They had lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. “This journey helps us know the land better,” he said. 
This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the mountains. They had to decide if they should drive or walk. It could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high mountain or in a tall tree. “These students know the Eastern Sierra well,” their leader said. “What seems wild to some is normal for others.” 
In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. The camera did not catch any shooting stars. This was a little disappointing, but it gave them a chance to talk about science and share another adventure story."

Chloe Morgan says that she did not like science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen years old. It happened by chance. “My younger brother loved dinosaurs, but I did not care about them. I helped him with a science project, and I found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. It amazed me! I knew I wanted to study this.” 
I ask her how she got support because Palaeontology was not a common job for young people. “I remember meeting my first palaeontologist,” she laughs. “His name was Matt Cornelius. He was famous, even though he was young. I was very nervous, but he was friendly and listened to me. I felt better when he was patient with my questions.” 
I ask Chloe about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. She thinks for a moment. “Movies like Jurassic Park have made many people interested in dinosaurs, but not in Palaeontology itself. I welcome this interest, but I think movies often show palaeontologists in a wrong way. We are either seen as strange geniuses or as silly people who cannot talk to others. Movies do not show what our real jobs are like.” 
I ask her to explain her job. “My job is very different every day. I dig up dinosaur bones, but I also work in labs, studying fossils and writing for science magazines. Sometimes, I talk to the public about science. I think it is important to help people understand science better. I want to reach young people because it is good for them to learn about science. Talking about dinosaurs can get children excited about nature and help them learn more.” 
The recent TV show Walking with Dinosaurs was a good chance for Chloe to help show dinosaurs on screen. She says the people who made the show knew what they were doing, and she was there to give advice. “I did not have to say much because the dinosaurs looked good. I mostly checked that the dinosaurs lived at the same time. We attracted many viewers because we have learned a lot about dinosaurs, and the ones in this show are very different from those in movies like Jurassic Park. They look more real than ever.” 
I ask Chloe why she thinks dinosaurs still interest us. “I think they make us curious. We want to discover new things. Even when our world feels small, dinosaurs remind us that there is still much to learn. Palaeontology is like time travel.”"

I will say this once: when you are traveling by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know that you are not ‘there yet,’ even when you keep asking, ‘Are we there yet?’ The truth is, when you arrive, it is not ‘there’ anymore; it is ‘here.’ So if you think you are ‘there’ yet, you should ask, ‘Are we here yet?’ 
I am sure that no one wants to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear this question over and over on long car trips. What are kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn’t you like to relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking at the beautiful views outside the window. 
In the front seat, there is mum or dad, helping with juice boxes, cookies, and changing the radio. They keep everything running smoothly. 
But then, someone in the car does something annoying – usually my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I can’t let him do that, so I put my foot on his side. Soon, we are fighting, and our parents have to separate us while driving. They tell Tim to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This helps for a while, and we can enjoy the views again. 
Later, I try to read, but I feel a draft on my arm. The window is closed, so where is it coming from? Tim is next to me, breathing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. This makes me angry. Tim gets yelled at again, and the car swerves. 
Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask, ‘Are we there yet?’ he often says, ‘Yes, we’re here. Get out of the car.’ But we are still on the highway, going fast. Then he says, ‘Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.’ This keeps us quiet for a bit. 
You can tell when you are finally ‘there’ when the adults get out of the car and move far away from the kids. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You are not there yet."

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can enjoy coffee and cake while playing board games. The owners hope that customers will love the experience and come back again. Zuzi says they wanted to create a place where people can be together and talk, not just look at their phones and screens.
The games played in John and Zuzi's café are called ‘Eurogames’. These games have simple themes, like farming and building. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by a German designer named Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources with each other. Everyone stays involved and no one feels left out. 
Later, cooperative games were made, where all players work together to win or lose as a team. One popular cooperative game is Pandemic, created by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings, which is based on a book. He remembers feeling scared and excited when he played it with friends. He wanted to create a game that made people feel good, whether they won or lost.
Leacock loved board games as a child, but he often felt disappointed when they did not meet his expectations. With help from his uncle, he tried to make better games using pieces from other games. Pandemic became very successful and had a lot of storytelling. It is like a video game because players develop characters and the story changes as they play.
The video game industry has helped board games become popular. Many people now play games on their phones. Ben Hogg, who works for a game company, says that everyone plays games on their smartphones. More people are open to playing games than ever before.
At first, video games allowed people to play together in person, like at arcades or on the sofa. But then, many video games moved online, and players could not see each other. Some people who liked video games wanted to play games with others in person again. 
In John and Zuzi's busy café, tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, games are now something to share with others in real life, and this trend will continue.

Jamie Scott has written and produced many popular songs in the UK. His story shows that hard work and not giving up are very important in the music business, even if you start with many failures. He says his mother was a great singer and helped him learn to play the guitar. The only radio he listened to at home was a local station for older people. This explains why he did not hear modern songs until he was 12 years old. At that time, he had to choose between playing tennis and making music. He played tennis at a high level, but he preferred music. He spent his lunch breaks in the music room at school, learning songs on the piano.
At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but did not want to perform. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to make music. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed; if he did not, he would need to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he got signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, the record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend.
Jamie found success as a songwriter instead of a performer. After a tough time with a record label in the UK, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. He did not become famous right away. He felt he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time as an artist, but as a writer, he was in the right place. He believes he is one of the main writers that UK labels turn to for new artists. He helps them understand that wanting to write popular songs is okay.
Jamie wants to write big songs that people love. He is not arrogant; he knows he has a talent for writing number one songs. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on making great music. He says, “When I go into the studio, we need to write the best music for next year. It’s not just about what is cool. We want to write classic pop songs.” 
**Questions:**
1. What did Jamie Scott's mother help him learn?
2. At what age did Jamie first hear a modern song?
3. What sport did Jamie play at a high level?
4. How long did Jamie's dad give him to succeed in music?

Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is a big star online, but many people, like me, do not know him because we do not watch online videos of people doing tricks on bikes. He is a ""street trials cyclist."" This means he jumps from hard places, like roofs or walls, to land safely in other strange places. People film these jumps and post them online.
I met Tony in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys know who he is, and some older people come to tell him he is ""an absolute legend."" After watching him, I agree. At first, I was not sure about him, but I was surprised by his courage and creativity. Before each jump, he explains what he wants to do, and sometimes I cannot believe he will succeed. When I compliment him, he seems not very happy. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans. He prefers to do things instead of just talking about them.
Tony knows that social media and cameras help him make money. He says, ""Sometimes I feel everyone is holding a camera or looking at a screen, and I do not like that."" But he is not complaining. He makes a good living from his videos, which used to be just a hobby for people like him.
After many years of talking to top athletes, I think two things help a child become a great competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are often more important than talent. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength you need. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what he thought were easy obstacles. He just got up and kept trying until he succeeded.
Some people do not see Tony as a hero. They think he is reckless and takes too many risks. He says, ""People who say this may care, but they do not understand. They probably have never ridden a trials bike and do not know the sport. They do not see that I get advice from experts to stay safe."" 
Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He explains, ""People are different. Some are not scared, and they should not do these sports. It is smart to know the dangers. Some people cannot get over their fear, but I can. I feel fear but find a way to move past it. I am not addicted to risk. I spend a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes I ride around to get ready before trying a new jump. I know I must stay calm before I jump. If I focus completely, then I am fine.""

56,B1,"'Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This wire was 66 metres above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net. She wore a belt around her waist that was attached to another wire above her. To help her keep her balance, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. 
Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. She already had some circus skills, but she found out that high-wire walking was very different. ‘The training was a shock,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then I did an hour of exercises, and another hour practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But I had to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’
On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-metre walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterwards. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ But this experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"
57,B1,"'In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing, an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. He had already written a book about his travels in Canada in a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and used it to go to Amsterdam for a holiday. “That trip opened my eyes,” he says. “I decided to see the world by bike.” Jeff did not want a normal touring bike and wanted to build one himself. “The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to learn how they were made.” After two tries in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally started his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. “Even though I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which I could not do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further I went from home, the more amazed people were by it.” His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got a serious fever and stayed in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. But despite all this, Jeff now says, “If I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.”'"
58,B1,"""I work at a university in the US. My team and I are learning about water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a special tool called a ‘night-vision scope’. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have gone down a lot. We do not know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but we do not know what they do at night because we did not have the right equipment. The new scope will give us clear pictures, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and make better choices to protect their home. 
It is hard work. There are four of us, and we each work six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places. I have taken a boat to some areas and written down notes about every duck I see. The weather has not been good. Some nights are warm, but most nights are wet. It is very quiet, and I have needed a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one workday because the snow was too deep for our special vehicles. I like this challenge, especially when I think about summer. In summer, we will work in a laboratory and look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this work. I would not change it for anything!"""
59,B1,"""When I tell people what my job is, they often don’t believe me. But I’m serious! I spend my days at work eating chocolate! Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure that customers get good chocolate from my company. Every week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate, from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones to put in the chocolate. 
Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I also share samples with my colleagues! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients to use. It’s great to have a private space during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am in our food lab, and other times I travel to buy our raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety in my job, even more than the chocolate!
People often ask me if I get bored of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, and I never feel tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"""
60,B1,"'Have you ever thought about what it is like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching balls, and trapeze, which is flying in the air above an amazed audience. 
In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to do different things all the time. It is important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of this job is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always want to improve their skills. 
People often think you will get hurt or that you can only work for a short time each year. But the real issue is thinking about the future because you can only travel while you are young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students start their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their stories. Sophia warns, however, that it is not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually does not have a regular salary. It is also competitive, but it is a lot of fun!”'"
61,B1,"'You may not know her name or her face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a backing singer. A backing singer helps the main singer by singing in the background. Many people think that backing singers are not good enough to be main singers. This is not true – they often have to be better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music world! 
“What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I will sing,” she says. “It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. It might also be a funny song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what the producers ask me to do. One time, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do my job!”
“Excellent musical skills are very important for my work, and I need to learn quickly. There is often no written music to follow. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different part, and there was an orchestra too. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are long enough already.”
“One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers do not always know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can see how to make it better.”'"
62,B1,"'Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge of fashion, but she created a successful business with her ‘satchels’ - a traditional bag used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before she chose to make satchels, Julie thought about different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to make the best choice. When she decided to make satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie said, “Many people said there was no need for them – but I believed in my idea.” She worked with her family from the beginning, especially her mother, who had never worked before but was good at business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children’s storybooks. 
Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her succeed. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To get more interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and more people became interested. Now, her company makes satchels faster. Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity is seen with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online ads, she uses the internet to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. 
There was a hard time when another company copied Julie’s design to sell similar bags. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors say there is a positive feeling in her offices – people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place.'"

When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to do many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her swimming coach thought she could be a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork.
When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special racing bike and started to compete. Vicky thought cycling looked exciting and decided to try it too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was near her school, so it was easy for her to go to training after school.
Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped competing. Vicky said, “I loved winning for many years, but I started to feel tired of it. When the excitement goes away, there is no point in continuing. Luckily, I found a new job.”
Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. “We work with young people who have never liked sports,” she says. “The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job and helps young people feel part of a group.”
The charity uses famous people to promote their work. Vicky says, “Some people think having a celebrity help a charity is not always good. They say celebrities do it for their own benefit, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.”"
64,B1,"'Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. Her parents did not play music, but there was always music in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested that Ana join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert.
A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. Ana wrote her first song, called Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. But Ana felt that the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about how this made her feel. She shared this song online, and many people loved it and found new meanings in the words.
Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know much about Isotope and did not want anyone telling her what to sing. But Joss convinced her that this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. All the tickets sold quickly, and it was a wonderful evening.
Ana prefers to write songs about difficult times in life, as she feels she has more to say then. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how sad it made him. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but she wants to write about her own important experiences.'"
65,B1,"'Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat on a guided tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write stories about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not share that interest. I had always wanted to visit this area because I saw it on TV when I was a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before they moved to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go with him, and he finally said yes!
A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather forecast said it would be calm when we arrived. I was busy at work and did not have much time to prepare, but Harry said he would take care of everything, so I stopped worrying.
When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group, packed our things into small boats, and started our journey. The guide told us that very few people live along that coast. On the first morning, the only animals we saw were dolphins and birds. We could see islands in the distance, but the morning fog made it hard to see far. I enjoyed watching the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.
We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish, many of which I did not know. It was nice to forget about time. We always remembered to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it felt relaxing!
When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!'"
66,B1,"""My dad was a basketball player in Germany, just like his dad before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that watching so many games would make me love basketball, but it did not. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often took a book to read instead of watching the games.
When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I believed in myself. After some time, I agreed to play, and a few weeks later, I played against another school. My parents came to watch, which made me more nervous, but it was OK in the end!
For the next four years, I practiced every day and did very well. I even joined an adult team before I moved to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was great to work with him. However, I did not enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I could not spend much time with my friends because of all the training, so that was not a big change for me. I got used to my new life, and my English got better quickly!
I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight to play well. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."""
67,B1,"""Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I saw my city in a new way every time! After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a tour guide full-time. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed to know a lot more to get a licence. All tour guides in Chicago must answer many questions about the city, like its history and public transport rules. After some hard but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide.
Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You also need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. It is important to handle different situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive or if the route changes. Tourists want to enjoy their tour, not hear about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy, or they might leave a bad review online. Good reviews are very important because they help attract more customers. I try to make my tours fun and easy. Because of my enthusiasm and energy, I usually get very good reviews, and many visitors recommend my tours to others coming to Chicago."""
68,B1,"""My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have things in common with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this kind of work. In the end, we had nothing to worry about. 
One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants!
The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we did not have much space. We chose to do this because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like. 
After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little upset with herself because she missed her friends too much. But when she thinks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"""
69,B1,"""My name is Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different customers. Hotels and offices often buy flowers for their reception areas. Sometimes, we provide flowers for businesses to use in their advertising photos. Once, I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it. 
My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark at that time, but I don’t let it bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. It can be hard to choose flowers because there are so many beautiful ones. My favorite color is pink, so I would choose pink flowers for myself. But I have to remember that other people may want different flowers. 
Not all flowers are available all year, so I sometimes cannot find what customers want. I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but I have to get the best price. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to save money when I can. 
Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and prepare vases with the flowers I bought. Then, we make flower bunches and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes ask them to think again about what they want. Some people may think this is too much work, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That is what you do when you sell things – I wouldn’t want any other job!"""
70,B1,"""My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films and many films for kids on weekends. It is close to my home, but a year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about a film in detail with other people after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made it perfect for the film, and it was great! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our prices low. We are happy to cover our costs and not make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier for us, especially now that we have our own good equipment. We can see how many tickets we sell online, so we don’t worry about empty seats! There is always a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great time, it feels wonderful. Our website helps us a lot, and we are now in touch with other film clubs in the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but it is always nice to come back to our own club! We also started a blog because most people look online for film information instead of reading local papers. We have put up some posters in cafés, but the best way to get people to come is by word of mouth – when friends tell each other about us. The audience loves the fun activities we have with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."""
71,B1,"""Taking photographs was my favorite activity when I was a child. When I was 15, I wanted to make my hobby better. So, I decided to start a special project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was surprised to find that many people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone suggested that I should have a common theme for my photos. I agreed and started to focus on nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing, as they took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost gave up. But in the end, I trusted myself and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget when the judges told me I won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography was good, and I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I am happy with my career choice."""
72,B1,"""I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new things like camping and sailing. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new skills. There are levels from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ help you. When you finish each level, you get a certificate.
When I first joined, my leader said I should help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure about this because I had joined that club when I was eight, and I found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate.
Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.
Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before joining the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one of them is for camping!"""
73,B1,"""I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a place in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try it. I was too young to ask him if I could snowboard, but he loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. After that, I loved snowboarding and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people do many competitions and get bored, but I still love to compete and win. This helps me work harder. I like not having a strict plan. Sometimes this works out well, like when I was the first girl to get a perfect score of 100 in a local competition. I was not sure I could do the jumps that got me this score until I tried. This made me trust my skills more. 
In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. This helps me deal with not doing what I love. I think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I want to have another job in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time to go to college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."""
74,B1,"'When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn’t know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am thankful to my parents for making me do that – it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much, so my parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try that. I thought it would be hard, but it was easy. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. My mum showed me how to make something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery to my friends and family. They said they liked it, but I thought they were just being nice. I still needed to know if other people would like it too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my things to take home. Soon, we got calls from people all over the country who wanted to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but we were just two people at a market stall! That was when I knew it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun!'"
75,B1,"'When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s life. In an interview, Janine said, “Because my father’s job made us move a lot, I learned to make new friends. I know what it is like to be the new student in a class. This helped me write about Amelia, the main character, and her new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. I am an only child, so I had to use my imagination to write about that.” 
Janine started her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother wanted to be a writer, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so writing seemed like a good way to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story competition on a young writers’ website. That is why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores. 
One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover has pictures of happy teenagers, the characters face some hard problems. This makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than many other best-selling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. She said, “At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. I want to help other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just need to spend time with my friends, and then I will have something interesting to write about!”'"
76,B1,"""My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father was invited to be the manager of the castle. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy to get this job, but it took time for the rest of us to agree. We were worried about life on the island. We thought the castle might not be as nice as our warm home across the water, and there was no school there.
After we moved, we got used to living on the island. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. In summer, the island is friendly and has many visitors. There are often parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there are not many teenagers. The adults help each other with work on the island, which can be hard.
The biggest change for me was taking a boat to my old school every day. I looked forward to going on stormy days when there are big waves, but the ferries do not run then! I also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is scary. So when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry!
We often see beautiful views, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you cannot see anything, but then it can be sunny again in a few hours. This still feels amazing to me, even after living here for a long time. We do have bad storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But I remember it has been here for many years, and it is still standing!"""
77,B1,"""I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural homes. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They taught me how to tell different types of birds apart and where to find them. It was amazing! After we came home, I joined a local birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different types of birds, and I am almost there. On family holidays, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there, but it didn’t happen. I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I made a video about my challenge and many teenagers liked it and said it looked fun. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a talk about birdwatching at school. I felt nervous before I went on stage. I knew what to say and had notes, but all my friends and the whole school were watching me! I relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I did well. I might do another talk next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not want to be birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter how old they are, and it doesn’t have to cost a lot of money."""
78,B1,"""I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew I liked to try new hobbies but then stop them, so they thought I would do the same with football. But I didn’t. I even dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I thought. I played in local tournaments, and one referee saw that I was a good player. He told the manager of a women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13 years old. I got much better. Still, some people were not sure I would be a star player, which made me a little sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in a championship match earlier than I thought I would! I ran very hard because I didn’t want to let my team down. Then, by chance, I scored the winning goal! Even with many people watching, I could hear my coach cheering for me. After the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to let them talk to other players in my club. They will see what it is like to be in a professional team and feel they can play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – there will be good times and bad times too. I have had very few bad times, so I feel lucky!"""

In the UK and around the world, there is a new idea in education. This idea encourages new students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way for everyone to learn and build skills. Research skills are important for your studies and for jobs because they help you think about the world and your work.
As a student, you can help create knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat what others say; you ask questions. You wonder things like: Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are important for research.
Research can be very complex and done by experts, but it can also be simple. It starts with asking questions and looking for answers. Most students have done some research before. You have probably asked questions for school projects or at work. You have also done research when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training your dog, or shopping online.
In college and higher education, it is important to ask questions, think critically, and explore information. Some students may find this hard because in some cultures, knowledge is seen as fixed. They may think they should only listen to teachers and books. However, in many places like the UK, US, and Europe, it is okay to question what you learn and who teaches it.
Doing research can feel challenging. Critical thinking is very important. We should not just repeat what we read or hear. Instead, we need to think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. We should not blindly trust everything we read or hear."

Cities have always been important places for ideas and discussions. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso discussed art in cafés. However, living in a city can be difficult. The same cafés in London that encouraged conversation also helped spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 
Today, cities are full of creativity, but they can also feel overwhelming. Scientists are studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are surprising. It is known that city life can be tiring, but new research shows that living in a city can make it harder for us to think clearly. One reason for this is that cities lack nature, which is good for our brains. For example, studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small views of nature can help our brains relax from the busy city life.
More people now live in cities than in the countryside. Instead of having open spaces, we are surrounded by many people in concrete areas. This crowded environment can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. When we walk in busy streets, our brains have to pay attention to many things, like other people and traffic. This constant need to focus can make us feel tired because it uses a lot of our brain's energy.
Natural places do not require as much focus. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature can help our brains recover. Natural settings have things that catch our attention without causing stress, unlike loud noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.
Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape designers warned about the problems of city life and wanted to bring nature into cities. Parks, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can help our brains feel better quickly. While people have tried many ways to improve brain function, like energy drinks or changing office designs, walking in nature seems to be one of the best solutions.
Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Research shows that the same crowded features of cities that can make it hard to focus also help create new ideas. The close social interactions in cities are important for creativity. Just like the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the busy environment of modern cities can also help people be creative. However, less crowded areas might not create as many new ideas over time. 
The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. Sometimes, people feel tired of nature and want to be in the city again."

Where should we look for the mind? This question may seem strange because we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced machines that can show us brain activity. However, I believe that studying the mind should not only focus on what is inside our heads. There is a lot of evidence from history that shows that objects and tools also help us think. For example, stone tools, jewelry, drawings, and writing have all played important roles in how humans have developed and how we think.
Many scientists study the mind by looking at people without the things they usually use. This is helpful for understanding the brain, but it can make us forget that we often think with the help of things around us. I do not want to say that the brain is not important, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It is useful to think about how human intelligence connects with culture and the things we use.
I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). This theory looks at how objects can help us think. For example, when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to create a tool, these actions show how we use things to think. MET also studies how this has changed over time and what it means for our thinking.
Think about a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The blind person and the stick work together, showing that our minds and the things we use are connected. The stick helps the blind person feel and understand the world. The brain sees the stick as part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence can change and grow when we use new tools and technology.
I see the human mind as something that is always changing and developing. The stick, whether it is a simple tool or a smartphone, helps us explore and understand our environment. For humans, tools are not just for getting food; they help us learn and satisfy our curiosity. This special ability to use objects is why humans create things more than any other species. I call this ability metaplasticity, which means our minds can change as we interact with the world around us. 
MET helps us understand how different tools, from ancient stone tools to modern smartphones, can change who we are and how we think. Technology that changes our minds may sound like science fiction, but humans have been using it since we first appeared.

82,C1,"""Photography is one of the most important inventions that changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It was used in many ways, like for science, industry, and art, and it also brought a lot of fun and entertainment with cameras. Historians believe that photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. This is a strong statement, but it shows how important photography is in American culture. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.
Why was photography so popular? First, it was a new technology that people loved. Just like steam power and railroads made travel easier, photography brought images of the world into homes quickly. Second, people used cameras to show their identity and how they wanted to be seen. Third, cameras helped families keep memories, even if those memories were not always real. Finally, photographs showed real life, which matched the style of many American artists.
A photograph is a way to show something important. It tells us what the photographer wants us to see. Because photographs are made by machines, they are records of what was in front of the camera. This gives them a sense of truth. However, every photograph also shows the photographer's point of view. When we see a photo, we might think we understand it because we know the subject, but the meaning of a photograph can be more complicated.
Many things in a photograph do not explain themselves. We need to think about where we see the photo and what information comes with it, like captions in newspapers or how it is displayed in a gallery. To understand a photograph's history, we should ask why the photographer took it and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things in different places and times.
For a long time, the importance of the camera to artists was not well known. But now, many artists use photographs in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings. Today, photography is seen as an important part of art, not separate from painting, but a key part of how we represent things before cameras were invented."""

In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition helps us understand psychology even today. We all have a mental life, which means we have thoughts and feelings. Psychology can be studied in humans, rats, and monkeys, but it can be hard to understand. 
William James was especially interested in human psychology. He believed it includes basic elements: thoughts, feelings, and the physical world around us. Our knowledge about these things is personal and comes from our own experiences. Sometimes, we make judgments about psychology based on our own feelings. We act like amateur psychologists when we share our opinions about why people behave in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy.
Problems can happen when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to find methods to decide which explanations are correct in different situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our personal thoughts and scientific facts. Psychology is about the mind and brain. Although psychologists study the brain, they do not know everything about how it works. They learn more by studying our behavior and making guesses about what happens inside us.
Studying psychology is difficult because the mind cannot be seen like a machine. We can only understand it by looking at behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. It requires careful observation and logical thinking. Psychologists want to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to change the processes they study. When they achieve these goals, they can help us understand our experiences and improve people's lives.
Psychological findings have helped in many areas, like teaching children to read better, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings when they are sad. Although people have talked about psychological questions for a long time, scientific study of psychology has only happened in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at one’s own thoughts and feelings, to find answers. While this is still interesting, it has limitations. 
William James said that trying to understand the mind through introspection is like trying to see in the dark. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior instead of just their own experiences."

In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. Some examples are A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, believes that each product has a sad story about the people who tried to sell it.
The museum is surprising because it makes money. Many companies do not keep samples of their failed products. Robert McMath, who started the museum, wanted to collect new products, not just the ones that failed. He began this in the 1960s. He learned that most products fail. Because he collected many new products, most of them were unsuccessful.
Today, many products in the museum show how people often think positively. They believe that new products will be successful, even when they are not. Sometimes, marketers spend more money on a product that is not selling well, hoping to make it successful. They do not want to talk about why the product failed.
This positive thinking is also common in self-help ideas. One popular idea is ""positive visualization,"" which means imagining good outcomes. Some scientists believe that our brains are made to see things positively. Research shows that people who think too positively may not be as motivated to reach their goals. For example, people who think they will have a great week at work may actually do less well.
Psychologist Carol Dweck says that how we see failure depends on our beliefs about ability. Some people think ability is something you are born with, while others believe it can grow with effort. People who think ability is fixed feel very bad about failure. For example, a sports star who thinks he is a natural talent may not practice enough and then fail. On the other hand, people who believe ability can grow see failure as a chance to learn and improve. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles get stronger when they are pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."

Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we thought was true is now being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players do their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. At the same time, people who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage is important. If players are paid enough, shouldn’t they feel comfortable playing anywhere?
What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games far away, like in Asia, to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans who believe their team needs their support and loyalty. Fans often think that the order of events explains what happens. For example, when a team plays well, the home fans cheer loudly, and sometimes this leads to a goal. Fans remember the times they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the many times when their cheering did not lead to a goal.
There is one idea that seems to be supported by science. Home fans not only cheer for their team but also direct their noise at the referee. In a famous study, referees listened to a recording of a match. Some heard the crowd cheering, while others heard a silent version. The referees who heard the crowd were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees try to avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd.
Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in many sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the Football League in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, but now they win about 60%. One reason for this change is travel. In the past, traveling was hard, but now players travel in comfort. Stadiums also look more similar now, which may affect home advantage.
Different sports have different levels of home advantage. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while team sports like basketball depend on teamwork. In basketball, players feel more confident when they play at home, which helps them work together better.
Another interesting finding is that players have higher testosterone levels before home games. This may be linked to a natural desire to protect their home ground. In recent Rugby World Cup games, underdog teams won at home against stronger teams, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It’s the law of the jungle out there."""
86,C1,"""‘The more I practice, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important for many athletes and their coaches. It is easy to understand why. First, many people argue about who really said it first. Second, the meaning is not clear. Player did not mean lucky in a real way; he was being ironic. His real message was: ‘The more I practice, the better I get.’ 
This idea connects to a big question: Is talent something you are born with, or can you learn it? Many people believe that practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for saying that you need 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in anything. His idea has inspired many books, like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, and others like Talent Is Overrated. These books say that practice is the most important thing to become good at something.
However, author Epstein argues that this is not always true. He points out a problem in studies about successful people: they often only look at those who are already excellent. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people are good at things and others are not. Epstein travels around the world to find answers, from Kenya to Sweden and even to Alaska. In Alaska, he learns that the drive of sled dogs might be important in races, showing that both genes and choices matter.
Epstein believes that both nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are important for elite athletes. He thinks that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in the world. But he also shows that sometimes genes are very important. He asks why we separate men and women in sports if only practice matters. Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest."""

A recent report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are children today so sad? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, looking at screens like TVs and computers. They have lost touch with nature, like forests, mountains, and rivers. She believes this is a big part of the problem.
A follow-up study talked to some children to understand their feelings better. The children did not say they wanted more technology. Many said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Older people often remember their childhoods fondly, saying they had more freedom. They spent their summers exploring, swimming, and building forts. They think this was better and healthier than how children live today. However, they often forget that they created the rules that keep their children safe, like not allowing them to play in old sheds.
Griffiths’ book has many strong opinions. She talks about how parents worry about dangers outside and how this fear helps companies sell toys and gadgets to keep children entertained at home. She also discusses how some people give medicine to children who are restless or make them wear goggles for playground games. It is unclear how common these rules are, but Griffiths expresses her anger about them.
While her ideas are interesting, Griffiths sometimes goes too far. She compares how we treat children today to racism, which seems extreme. She has a very positive view of children, saying they are creative thinkers. However, this view may not match reality, especially when dealing with energetic young children.
One important idea in the book is that children should be allowed to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children need to experience small accidents to learn how to stay safe. She says, “Children need accidents,” which helps them avoid bigger problems later. However, she does not explain how to create these small accidents safely. Also, not all children want to explore the wild. What about the shy or cautious children? Perhaps the real issue is that we try to make all children fit into the same mold, whether we keep them inside or push them outside. 
**Questions:**
1. What do many children in rich countries feel, according to the report?
2. What does Jay Griffiths think is a big problem for children today?
3. What did the follow-up study find about what children want?
4. How do older people remember their childhoods?
5. What does Griffiths say children need to learn about safety?
6. Why might Griffiths' views be seen as too extreme?"

I am a bio-psychologist with a PhD, which means I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and in life, but this is not just because of my education. Many problems in life cannot be solved with complicated formulas or answers we learn in school. They need good judgment, wisdom, and creativity that come from life experiences. For children, these experiences happen during play.
My recent research is about how important play is for children’s growth. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Animals that need to learn more play the most. For example, meat-eating animals play more than plant-eating animals because hunting is harder to learn than eating grass. Primates, like monkeys and apes, play more than other mammals because they need to learn more.
Children, who have a lot to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills children need to live happy and good lives are not taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, working together, and controlling their feelings.
Creativity is very important for success. We do not need people who just follow instructions or do simple calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can help people think ahead and find solutions, we will have a strong workforce. But this needs creative thinking. Creative people often have a playful mind.
Some adults, called geniuses, keep their childlike ability to think creatively. Albert Einstein said that school almost made him lose his interest in math and science, but he found it again after leaving school. He called his creative work “combinatorial play.” He imagined chasing a sunbeam and thought about what would happen.
We cannot teach creativity, but school can take it away by focusing on questions that have only one right answer. It is also very important to get along with others, care for them, and work together. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills and fairness, which they need for life.
Play is voluntary, which means players can stop whenever they want. If you cannot stop, it is not play. Players know they must keep each other happy to keep the game going. This freedom makes play a very fair activity.
School has become harder: there are fewer breaks, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Organized sports have taken the place of free play. “Play dates” with adults have replaced unsupervised play, and adults often feel they must step in instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have happened slowly but are very big. They are caused by many social factors, like parents’ fears, warnings about dangers, and the idea that children learn more from adults than from each other.
Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and the future, we must change the bad trend of the last fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They should be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an uncertain future."

In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect directly with employers. This is easier than the old way of standing outside an office with a sign that says ""hire me."" But using social media can also lead to mistakes.
For example, a young man in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. He thought she could help him find a job because she knew many important people. However, she was upset that he asked her to share her contacts. She rejected his request and sent a very rude message that many people saw online. People were shocked by her message, and she might regret how she wrote it. But if this makes young people think more about how to use social media for work, it could help them.
Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it well. Many young people have used sites like Facebook and Twitter for fun for a long time. When older generations were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to show off and be creative. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. You could also change how you looked online with pictures and songs.
However, using social media for work is very different. Some young people do not see this difference. They may think that being bold and confident online is still a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. Young people need to understand that what they learned about social media as teenagers does not work for jobs. They must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.
One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual and seem arrogant. This makes older people think young people feel entitled. In reality, many young people are worried about finding jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills to be good workers.
So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly say who you are and explain how you can help them. Maybe you can offer to do some research for them. This way, you have a better chance of getting a helpful reply. Avoid sending the same message to many people, and keep your tone polite to make a good impression. Remember, social media can help you make important connections, but you need to use it carefully to avoid problems."

It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people reading UK national newspapers has dropped by a lot, between one-third and one-half. In the USA, a study shows that only 26 percent of people get their news from newspapers now, down from 45 percent in 2001. Some people believe that printed newspapers will disappear in the next 15 years. 
However, history shows that old forms of media often survive. For example, in 1835, a journalist said that books and theatre were finished and that newspapers would be the most important source of news. But theatre survived, even with the rise of cinema and television. Radio is still popular today, and cinema has also done well against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are coming back, with online sales increasing a lot since 2008.
Newspapers were once a new form of media too. It took a long time for them to become the main source of news. This happened because it became easier to share news with many people thanks to new technology in the 19th century, like the steam press and the telegraph. People also started to think that they needed to know what was happening around them more often. In the past, people only noticed changes in the seasons or big disasters like floods or diseases.
Before the 19th century, journalism was not a job that many people could do for a living. There was no strong need for news every day or week. Sometimes, having newspapers published regularly can be a problem. Now, people can read news online whenever they want. They can choose what news is important to them. When big news happens, online news can be updated very quickly. Mistakes can be fixed right away, and people can read full documents related to the news.
This is very different from how newspapers work. However, many news providers focus on being the first to share news instead of helping people understand it better. In the past, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. Today, it seems like we are going back to that way of sharing news. Newspapers have not always done a good job of explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand things better in this chaotic world.

Humans are not really at home under the moon and stars. We are used to the sun’s light. This is part of our nature, even if we do not think about it. Because of this, we have changed the night by adding light. This is similar to building a dam in a river. But this change has problems, called light pollution. Scientists are just starting to study light pollution. 
Light pollution happens because of bad lighting design. This means that artificial light shines into the sky instead of down where it is needed. Bad lighting makes the night bright, changing the light levels that many living things, including us, are used to. When man-made light spreads into nature, it affects many things like migration, reproduction, and feeding.
A long time ago, the term ‘light pollution’ did not exist. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night in 1800. At that time, nearly a million people lived there, using candles and lanterns. There were only a few gas-lit houses, and no public gaslights in the streets for another seven years. From far away, you would smell London more than see its dim light.
We have brightened the night as if it were empty, but many animals are active at night. Light is very strong and attracts many species. For example, birds can be drawn to bright lights and circle around them until they fall. Birds that migrate at night can crash into tall buildings that are brightly lit. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange times because of artificial light.
At first, people thought light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the stars clearly. But we all need darkness. Without it, our bodies do not work well, which can cause health problems. The way we wake and sleep is connected to the light and dark on Earth. Changing this can be harmful to us.
In the end, humans are affected by light pollution just like frogs near a bright highway. By living in our own bright world, we have lost touch with our history and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe and the beauty of a dark night with the stars above."

The leader of a big company recently said that his company will not keep track of how much paid holiday time employees take. This idea came from a smaller internet company that has a similar policy. The leader said he got the idea from a happy email from his daughter. In the email, she sounds like a writer from her father’s company. 
Some people think this announcement is just a way to make the company seem friendly, but we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the big company has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of “take as much time off as you want” seems better for a smaller company where workers know each other’s jobs well. In a big company, it is harder to know if taking time off will hurt the business.
The leader of the big company said employees can take as much leave as they want, but they must be sure that their work is up to date and that their absence will not hurt the business or their careers. But is it really possible to be that sure? No matter how much work you finish before a holiday, there will always be more work when you return. This means that workers might feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress. If workers do not take enough leave, it can make them less productive over time.
There can also be pressure from coworkers about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, which can make it hard for workers to take holidays. If workers feel they cannot take their leave, they might feel lazy or worry about their jobs. This could lead to a situation where workers do not take their entitled leave, or they might still follow the old rules about leave, making the new policy useless.
Modern technology makes it easy to receive work messages anytime, which can mix work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how to balance this new way of working with the old rules about time off. But if there are no set working hours, it can feel like every hour is a working hour. Employees might feel like their work hours are always being watched, which can make them feel stressed.
Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest and free time are important for their health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like better morale and creativity, can happen without harming worker well-being. So, I am not sure if allowing workers to take as much holiday as they want is really the goal or the result of this policy."

Peer review is when experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. This process is important because it helps to make sure that only good quality papers are published. However, reviewing a paper can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Is this delay worth it? Some people think it is, and some do not. 
Many scientists still believe in peer review, but things are changing. More researchers are using preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed. Preprints help scientists share new results quickly so others can read and discuss them. 
Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers. This can lead to problems, as some scientists may cut corners to get published in top journals. Reviewers often focus on whether a paper is good enough for a specific journal instead of just checking its quality. 
There are issues with the current system, but many people are hesitant to change it. However, some scientists, like Ron Vale, believe that preprints could help. Even though preprints have been around for twenty years, not everyone uses them. Some scientists worry that journals will not accept papers that have been shared as preprints. They also fear that publishing without peer review could lead to poor-quality science. 
But preprints allow for immediate feedback from a global community of reviewers. For example, Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her paper as a preprint. This way, the original authors could respond to her critique, and everyone could see the discussion. If a paper is rejected by a journal, the preprint and comments are still available, so the work is not wasted.
Preprint archives allow scientists to have discussions that used to happen only between a few people. They can also share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals that focus only on new discoveries. Papers on preprint archives are read and cited more often, showing that sharing research this way is effective. By using the internet's openness, preprints can help scientists focus on the quality of their work, not just where it is published.

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say, ""a painting in words."" But this answer does not make me or them happy. One day, I asked a group of students to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph was to describe the object like a scientist, and the other was to write from the object's point of view, calling it ""Poem."" One student wrote: 
**Poem**  
I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need to use me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions.
When I was in school, poetry was confusing for me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that made it hard to understand feelings. After school, many people care less about poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down because it is boring or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying.
What do we want to find in poems? A poem can show deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever thoughts. But if we want tears, we watch movies. For information, we read articles. Novels take us to different worlds, and music is hard to beat with its mix of words and sounds. 
However, poems can be useful because they can be unclear. Everyday life is full of uncertainty, unlike reading sentences. But this does not tell us what a poem really is. If you look up ""poem"" online, it says it is a type of art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language. This is a fancy way to explain it, but the word ""poem"" comes from Greek, meaning ""a thing made."" A poet is someone who makes things. 
So, if a poem is a ""thing made,"" what kind of thing is it? Some poets say poems are like wild animals – hard to control – or like machines – made with care. But these comparisons do not always work. The best part of trying to define a poem is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about both. It can help you see everyday things in a new way.
A poem is not hard to understand, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and music is powerful, like the saying, ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But sometimes, words can hurt. Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine. A poem can touch you deeply, even though it looks like regular writing. 
What about the empty space around the poem? This space could be used for a longer article or an ad. A poem is written and rewritten like an article or story, but it is not just made to sell. Publishers send out poetry books, but they do not expect them to make money. A poem is not just for the market; it is special on its own. Because of its unique place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."

I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. £70 was a lot of money then, and I could have spent it on something useful for the house. But my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip. Over the years, every brooch and coin I found made me happy. I liked feeling connected to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years before I found something that impressed Marion again.
One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours to search. It was raining, so I went to a nearby place where I knew there was old farming equipment. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it, but I had to check. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get my hopes up. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, thick loop.
I remembered seeing something like this before - the Great Torc, in the British Museum. It is a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring like the one I found. I took it to my car. On the way home, I kept looking at the torc on the seat next to me. I washed it in my kitchen sink, which was probably the only clean it had since ancient times.
“Marion!” I shouted, “I have something for you.” I was still looking at my find when my wife came into the room and stopped. “What is it?” she asked. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it being stolen, so I got up and hid it under a floorboard in my office.
The law says I must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as I could before I gave it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned around and stopped talking. The torc was confirmed as real and was sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. I received £350,000, which was shared between the owner of the field and me. 
But the torc is more than just money. It is something I have saved for the nation. People say to me, “Now that you found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?” But the brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing - not while there is a chance to catch a bigger fish tomorrow."

Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don’t talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy trips, with every moment planned for activities like visiting museums or hiking, I just smile and don’t say much. What would they think if they knew that my travel plans have big empty spaces for naps in the afternoon and lazy mornings in nice beds? Sleeping better is one of the good things about traveling. 
When I went to Mexico’s Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how many hours I spent sleeping—more than 12 hours most days. There were many loud birds nearby, but it didn’t bother me. Far from home, with new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and have many dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, I could sleep more easily. 
I think sleep is not just a break from traveling; it is part of the travel experience. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. All these new experiences fill us up. When we sleep, we process all this new information. It makes sense that sleep feels different when we are traveling. 
People often worry about jet lag, but I think the problems I have after long trips are more about getting used to new places than about time changes. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up very early to avoid the heat, feel tired around 10 a.m. when the sun is strong, and then feel active again in the cool evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to the different sleep patterns. When I finally adjust, I feel like I have really arrived.
I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends in an apartment with a view of the blue Caribbean Sea. After eating, we all felt sleepy, and the conversation slowed down. One by one, my friends left the table to lie down on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows on the floor. I took some pillows and joined them. I had heard about the Latin American custom of the siesta, but that day I really experienced it. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life.
Travel sleep is special because I remember it. In a new place, I enjoy the different smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If enjoying every moment of travel is what makes a good traveler today, then sleeping is one of the best ways to do that. Maybe I should not feel embarrassed about my love for sleep and tell my busy friends that travel sleep is an important part of traveling too."
97,B2,"The woman turned away from the mirror. “What do you think? Please be honest.” Mia picked up a medium-sized hat. It was soft and had a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. “I still think this one looks best on you,” she said to her customer politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a funny face. “But it is so boring,” she said. “Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This pretty little hat will make me stand out.” She patted the red and black mini top hat on her head. “Yes,” she said firmly, “this is the one I want.” Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at her daughter’s wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family get-together. It had been a while since they had all been together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also looking forward to meeting Jen’s friend, Tattie. They did not know anything about Tattie. Mia’s husband, Jeff, had quickly pointed this out when Jen called last week. “Tattie? What kind of name is that?” Jeff had said. “It’s short for Tatiana,” Mia replied. “I think it’s nice.” “It sounds strange,” Jeff said. He did not like anything fancy or showy. He also did not like Mia’s way of being polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have said that a dustbin lid would look better on her. “The problem with you, Mia,” he often said, “is that you are too polite.” 
An hour later, Mia closed her shop and went in the back door of Medlar House. It took her only forty seconds to get home from work. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia had the idea to turn the unused barn next to the house into a space for her business. Jeff was not sure. “Do you really think people want to buy hats?” he asked. Mia knew that many friends had trouble finding the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. In a friendly place, she let them try on many hats until they found the right one. She encouraged her customers to bring their outfits so they could match everything. Recently, she started selling handbags and costume jewelry too."

It is a long way from London to Atlanta. In his new home in America, Lawrence Okoye thinks about his amazing sports journey. He is very confident but is also surprised by how far he has come. He went from being in an Olympic final in discus throwing to possibly playing American football. Lawrence has never played American football before, but he might be chosen for one of the big teams in the USA.
In Atlanta, Lawrence is learning about his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London could be picked for one of the biggest teams in American sports. But Lawrence likes to prove people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to train seriously for discus throwing instead. He had played rugby before. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world.
Lawrence came to Atlanta to train for discus throwing in warm weather. He wanted to prepare for the world championships. When asked about his chance to get a big NFL contract, he said, “American football was in my mind, but I only decided to try it when I got to the USA.” He had thought about it while in school, but it seemed like a crazy idea then. After arriving in America, he saw that there were trials for the NFL in Atlanta. Even though he had never played before, he thought he could be good enough to attend the trials. “Pretty much,” he said. “I went on the site and applied.”
Was he nervous about being tested with players who had played football all their lives? “No,” he said. “I don’t get nervous for many things.” He does not talk a lot, but he believes in his abilities. The results from his tests showed that he was the best player. “I was very happy to hear that,” he said, showing some pride.
However, he is also careful. He has no experience in football. How can he make it into an NFL team? “The coaches say I have what I need. It’s about how hard I work,” he replied. Will he be calm while waiting to hear if he has been chosen? “I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I will be selected, but I’m not too worried.”
This calmness might come from his bad experience in the Olympic discus final when he came last. He has moved on from that and is happy that he qualified for the final with a great last throw. “That was an amazing day,” he said. “The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sports. I can go back to it.”
After his Olympic disappointment, some people thought he would not do well again. Lawrence does not want to talk about that. An NFL player’s minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so there is a lot of money to be made. Lawrence has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With all his talent, wouldn’t it be better to focus on just one sport? “I understand why someone would say that,” he replied. “I want to achieve something I have dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.”"

The dark brown and green colors made me feel better. It was mid-September, but it was still summer in Siberia. I could see no people, just mountains, rivers, and forests going to the far horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. “Good morning, Robert,” he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to sell safety clothes to the local mines. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. But with a dictionary, I told him I was going to the city of Magadan in Siberia with a one-way ticket because I wanted to ride my bicycle back home to England. “But, Robert,” he said, “there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.” I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. “Alone?” he asked, pointing at me. “No, I will ride with a friend named Al.” “Just one friend?” “Yes, just one,” I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and pointed outside, saying “Holodna” (cold). I tried to show him with my hands that I had warm clothes, but I didn’t say that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes were bought at low prices. I was not sure if they would be good enough. This was especially true for my big over-trousers that I bought for £10. 
It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of tired students. Some were taking notes without energy. The teacher was talking on and on. I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? “Well, why not?” I took a fresh sheet of paper and wrote, “Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.” In front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, wrote something, and passed it back. I opened it and held my breath while I read. “OK,” it said. Six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. The job was often hard, but it was never boring, and I had long holidays to go on adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure spirit after our bike ride in Pakistan and decided to cycle around the world. Since our first ride, Al had taken on bigger and bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would be too hard for him. Even though it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure and facing new challenges every day. He was proving wrong the people who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive.'"

In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons that are between 15 and 25 metres high. They make sharp turns, do barrel rolls, and fly in loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it is like to fly in this race. 
An hour before my flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets. Small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to keep my eyes on the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I also had to promise to relax and enjoy the view when I was upside down.
Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything during the flight. When we started moving down the runway, I was very nervous. I had to keep my legs up and not touch the important pedals and switches. I knew I should stay calm, but I was scared.
The pilot, Dario, and I were in a very fast acrobatic plane called the Zivko Edge 540. When the plane took off, we quickly turned to the right. I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon and held my breath as I sank into my seat. For a moment, I felt much heavier than normal. Then we flew straight again. We turned left and dived down, making my stomach feel funny. 
We flew very close to the ground, between two pylons, at 400 km per hour. I was excited but also scared. For two minutes, I got to fly the plane, but my hands were shaking. Dario then did a barrel roll, which is a full turn in the air. He asked if I was okay, and I said yes. He asked if I had enough, and I said no, even though I was scared. Then he did a loop, flying up and over in a circle.
Many people would find this fun, like riding a rollercoaster. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, I heard a voice telling me to relax and look up. I looked up and saw fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was easier than what the pilots usually do in the race. When we landed, Dario ate sandwiches, but I didn’t eat for hours. That night, I dreamed about flying in loops over and over again.

Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen amazing videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, he probably filmed them. He says his favorite temperature is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and a diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew find different places to film. After 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him: he could travel, have adventures, and dive underwater.
Now, he is a top cameraman and has worked on many important TV wildlife shows. He started working 35 years ago when not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees, but he became known as the ""cold man."" He felt that many amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed. When he started, the camera and technology were very simple. He says, ""It is much easier to film today. In the past, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Now, with digital cameras, you can see what you filmed right away. You used to think a lot about what shots you needed next. Film was very expensive, but now you can film a lot.""
Allan says his experience in cold places is very valuable. He has spent so much time on sea ice that it feels normal to him. He does get cold toes, but he thinks the poles are healthy places because there are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. Wildlife filming has many successes, but also failures. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not tell which birds they were.
Recently, Allan got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. He knew it would be hard. It is a place for polar bears and is very dangerous. In April, it is usually -32°C, and the wind is strong. Carrying cameras in deep snow is very difficult. After walking for five hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, he had only seen one mother bear and her cub. But on day 24, he felt like he was part of the bear world. He said, ""We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. After five hours of watching, I see something very quickly. I almost miss it, but my camera is ready. I see a black nose, then a head, and soon a mother bear is resting in front of the hole. She looks at me but does not care. Just then, she slides down the slope, and I think she is having fun."" Then, two cubs appeared at the den entrance. ""It is their first view of the world, and we have front-row seats.""
Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see how it affects their lives. He believes he can make an amazing documentary."

In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim in very cold water, deal with frostbite, and be careful of polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new adventure that is even bigger. Explorers like Pen are confident and determined. This time, there is a lot at stake. Pen and two friends will go on a three-month journey of 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and Pen knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will show what global warming is doing to the ice in the polar region.
Pen was prepared for this job since he was a child. His father’s old nanny, who worked for the famous polar explorer Scott of the Antarctic, took care of him. She made him tough by sending him out into storms with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in the cold, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses. She helps him with his polar guide business and worries more about him when he is at home. She says, “He is in more danger driving because he thinks he is in the Arctic.”
For fun, Mary once raced against Pen in a famous mountain event where people on horseback race against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. They live in the countryside with their two children. Pen says, “It is harder to be away from them this time.” When he last went to the Arctic, his son was one year old and his daughter was five. He told his son, “You are the man of the house now, look after your mum and sister.” His son took this seriously and asked his mum how she was all the time, but it became too much for him. Pen thinks it was not fair to say that. 
For this trip, he plans to have very little contact with his family. He says, “If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.” In the days before he leaves, he is getting his equipment ready. He says, “Out on the ice, it is very hard to fix things.” He will be with Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a team of six people to help them by flying in supplies.
Pen feels that being part of a team is stressful for him. He is also thinking about his age. “I will be 47 on Thursday. I have not trained as much as I should.” He feels that organizing things always seems more important. He is worried about what he will have to do. Pen believes that this mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge. He says, “Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time scientists will use the data we collect. We want to involve many people in what is happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and we are the only ones who can do it.” He adds, “Our skills, which seem strange, are now very useful.”"
103,B2,"'I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. Even though I enjoyed these activities, I wanted to compete again. I wanted to stay in shape so I could try for the Olympics if I felt that way again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about Ben Fogle’s invitation: “Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?” I have always loved rowing and the feeling of the boat moving through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they were not very excited. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to join the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. This made the race feel real, not just a talk. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but we still needed to work hard to get it. I also had to think about losing money because I would be away from home. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money after being a professional athlete. It is nice that people are interested. But I find it hard to talk about my past without a new goal. Joining the race would mean I wouldn’t just talk about what I did before. I would be doing something again: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was hard, but it was simple. I trained almost every day, but my training plan was clear, and I had doctors and dieticians to help me. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I thought it might look like I just wanted to be on TV. My worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is about more than just rowing. It is also about the mind. Ben had done tough challenges, but he could not row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of understanding. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest with Ben about how much he needed to improve. I should have known that would be his level when I agreed to race with him.'"

A little over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. I was 26 years old and felt restless. I dreamed of cold, snowy landscapes because I wanted to escape the busy life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They hired me as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow. They started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which is pretty but basic, with bad electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months, but the work would be hard. I started packing right away.
**November 6, London**  
On my flight, I stared at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I was supposed to remember their names, but I felt nervous. I looked out the window instead. I thought about how spring moves north, but I saw winter moving south, with rivers freezing.
**November 7, Helsinki and Hetta**  
The bus ride north was what I hoped for. We drove through dark forests with snow on the trees, stopping for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark. As soon as I got in, Anna handed me a pair of boots and sent me outside into the cold. She asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the sound of barking and found the dogs. Three people were running around, getting the huskies ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited and wanted to go. I tried to introduce myself, but everyone was too busy. I petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone told me to get in the sled, and I almost fell in. Then we took off into the dark with only a headlamp for light.
**November 15, Hetta**  
I quickly learned how to be a husky guide, but first, Anna asked me if I was useful. I didn’t know how to answer. I realized I wasn’t very useful because I had never driven a snowmobile or used an axe. But when someone asked if I had a driving license, I nodded, feeling relieved. I learned the basics of dog-sledding quickly: lean into the corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and hold on to the handlebar. But other tasks were hard. Feeding and watering the dogs was difficult in the cold. Water would freeze quickly, so we made a 'soup' of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was tired from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I felt proud. I emailed my friends, saying, ""I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw. In the snow."""
105,B2,"'On that day, when Radcliffe ran past the finish line, reporters came to talk about her amazing race. They noted that her time was good enough to let her compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about a special treatment called emu oil. This was a product that Olympic gold medal winner, Cathy Freeman, had suggested to help Radcliffe heal after she had an accident while training. Radcliffe says that she did not fully understand how big her achievement was at that moment. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal. But for her, it was just what she was meant to do that day, so it felt normal. She and her team decided not to set limits on what they could achieve. Their motto was: no limits. 
During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried that she might not be able to keep up her fast pace. He thought it might make her drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry about this, but he understood that people who did not know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to think about her time. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers very quickly, but she still managed to sprint the last distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster than that.’ She remembers the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a long time. Radcliffe thought, “I will come back and do it next year.” Sadly, that did not happen.
After the race, everyone wanted to know how Radcliffe, who ran in a strange way, had beaten the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, helping her with her training. He said, ‘I have worked with 63 Olympic medalists, and no one could take the level of pain that she could. She would make me work hard because I had to go deep into her muscles.’ Hartmann talked about traveling 13 hours from his home in Ireland to Radcliffe's training place in France. When he arrived, her husband shouted, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no time for greetings or tea. Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour training session. She always pushed him to give his best. 
During this time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes he worked with became upset. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I trained very hard, but there are people who are more talented. I thought Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner) would do it. Maybe it is because people are racing against each other instead of racing against themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘It is about always pushing yourself, even when you are winning. That probably helped me because I never thought, “I can relax now.” It was always: “keep going as fast as you can.” Radcliffe did not know it then, but that marathon was the best she would ever run. She would not run that fast again. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running.'"
106,B2,"'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, came out, I did not know how people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a food ‘revolution’ in Britain, and I thought we made a special series that added something new. But I was still worried: would people like a way of cooking that included not just techniques but also history and science? I watched the first show feeling both happy and scared. I did not need to worry. The show became very successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my restaurant. In each project, I felt like I was on a journey, whether into the past or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each one with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often about traveling, with passports and suitcases. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest book, and in it, you will travel around the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent many years trying to reach their own idea of perfection. Perfection is different for everyone. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew I would upset some people by leaving out their favorites. I could imagine people asking, ‘Where is steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ But after a long meeting, the TV team and I finally made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that each person has their own idea of perfection, based on their feelings and memories. Even though the book is called ‘Perfection’, I knew I would not say the recipes were the best. I believed that by using my skills and talking to food producers, chefs, and customers, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means improving through practice. Trying new ideas and changing them until you have something special. The TV show let me explore many foods, people, and places I had never seen before, and I was excited to think about memories in food because I started in this business in the same way. Finding the best ingredients took me all over the world. I had many adventures, like visiting a canning factory that was using the wrong tomatoes and going to a dairy farm that was not good enough for filming! To improve each recipe, I even hand-milked a cow and used dry ice to make ice cream, cooked chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burned my house trying to make a real Neapolitan-style pizza.'"

We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the front of the van. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets. He looked like he knew what he was doing. “Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,” he said after a while, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried. “We can’t stay here forever,” she said. The field was big and had only grass and many flowers, like poppies and daisies. “No, we can’t stay here forever,” I said, because it was better to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John get smaller as he walked to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay down on the grass. “Tell us a story,” she said. Bea lay down next to her. “Go on, tell us a story.” So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and an argument over a worm. “That’s silly, no one understands bird language,” Bea said. My eyes felt wet. “I do.” But I didn’t sound sure. “Liar,” Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I thought about it and felt confused. “Mum…?” But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys waved and smiled at her through the back windows. We followed John into a café. It was not far from where our van was parked. “It’s a hotel,” John whispered. “It might be a bit expensive.” “We’ll just have some tea,” Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. “It’s like syrup,” she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. “It’s a miracle it got us this far,” he said when it started to get dark. Mum took out blankets and made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It felt nice to sleep on the ground. “I will have to get us towed into Marrakech,” John said. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we would get home now that our van had to be pulled everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."

Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were also at the Prague Classical Music Festival. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city named Liesel or Louisa. They were both older than Lucy by about ten years. They spoke good English and talked about the music they were playing and their travels. 
“I think I'm going to Tanglewood this summer,” Lucy said. It sounded impressive, but she didn’t really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She didn’t want to do many things that took up her time, like concerts and competitions. These events made her miss a lot of school, so she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. 
Lucy didn’t even want to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. She was lucky to be chosen from thousands of applicants. At the party, her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate. Her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took Lucy out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The funny thing was, Lucy hadn’t applied to the festival. Her mom filled out the form and sent in a CD. “I didn’t want you to be sad if you didn’t get in,” her mom said. Lucy thought her mom didn’t want to give her a chance to say no. 
The guy from Tokyo leaned forward. “Tanglewood?” he asked. “Yeah,” Lucy replied. “How old are you?” he asked. “Fifteen,” she said. He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, “Wow.” Lucy didn’t mean to show off. It was hard to know when to share her achievements and when to be quiet. 
“It’s just part of this new youth program they are trying,” she explained. Liesel/Louisa then looked across the room and said she had to go talk to someone. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, “Have you ever been to Japan?” He had long, messy hair, like many musicians, to show he was a cool music nerd. “Once, when I was about eight,” Lucy answered. 
Just then, Lucy's grandfather came over. “Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,” he said, pulling her away from the conversation. “And don’t get too friendly with the competition.” “They’re not the competition,” Lucy replied. “Everyone is the competition,” her grandfather said. He took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, understanding only part of what they said. 
In the elevator to their room after the party, her grandfather said, “You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and people are talking about you. They all know who you are.” Lucy liked that. She liked being someone important, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn’t make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play difficult music. But in places like this, Lucy felt she mattered.

“It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,” said Dad. It is hard to argue with him, so I wanted to learn what experts say about this. I found it interesting. 
Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have real-life friends, a good sense of who they are, and learn important skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social networking is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use social media differently than adults. They do not just check emails or buy things; they live in it. This is not good or bad – it depends on how you use it.
How is our social networking different from what our parents did when they were young? Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says it is like hanging out at a youth club. Parents used to do this to share jokes and gossip. Social media helps teenagers find their identity away from their parents and deal with teenage issues with their friends.
Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that adolescence is a time to ask, “Who am I?” Social networking can help with this. You can share your favorite music or sports, find what you like, and see how others think differently. Research shows that teenagers who use social media are not more self-centered than those who do not. He also says that for shy people, talking online can be easier than in person. It can help them practice social skills in a safe way.
Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with special interests connect with others. If you are one of the few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a group online with similar interests, you can feel more popular in a different way.
Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: “Young people can find new interests online, join groups, and create their own content. This is how they use social networks well.” She thinks social networking is a way to be creative. Teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers connect, learn, and share their work. 
“This helps with getting jobs in the future,” she says. “Every business uses social media to sell and promote themselves. You need to know how it works to attract customers. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on social networks, they can all be potential customers. If you connect all those networks, you have your customer base.”
Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they become adults and look for jobs, says Matthews. “One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create and share content. Working together is an important skill for jobs in the digital age.”"

When most people think of a fun family vacation, they might not think of a long trip through nine western states in the US and one Canadian province. But my parents wanted to have a special summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan a family trip that my twin brother and I were not excited about. They often said, “Not enough people do this anymore,” while we exchanged worried looks.
In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for any weather. I was happy but knew I would miss my own space for the next two weeks. With little room left in the car, we started our “Family Great American Road Trip.” As we left our big home for smaller places to stay for the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into.
We drove west through Oklahoma. Even though we were close to home, we had many adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma, under a sky full of stars, after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right-of-way on the road!
The next day, we woke up early and continued our trip. We saw deserts turn into mountains. Each day was different, but they all blended together. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly town showed us what we would experience later.
As we climbed to our next stop, we learned that some roads are better for Jeep cars. We saw a mix of old and new everywhere we went. We often got stuck in traffic because of construction. We laughed when we saw the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. 
On our way to Yellowstone National Park, we saw many wind farms. At Yellowstone, we watched the sun set over bear habitats near the roads. We often had to stop for bears crossing the road, which was funny and exciting. 
As we drove, life at home felt far away. Even the old hotel we stayed in, which had no internet or cell phone service, could not stop our excitement. I saw the most beautiful views I had ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we started our trip back south. My parents were right. You don’t need to go to a faraway place to find something amazing. 
It was nice to be home together again, and I was happy that I didn’t fight with my brother during our long trip. We took three thousand photos of our adventures, and I knew I would remember the fun surprises we had along the way."

Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and living at the college. She had the best room with a kitchen and a study area. Amy was happy because she also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would check on Amy, even if she did not want them to.
Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a few happy times with her grandmother and did not know her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not very happy, but Daisy was excited to see Rose again. Rose did not understand why her parents did not get along with her grandma. They had not spent summers with Daisy because of this. Rose was only ten years old when she last saw her grandmother, but she remembered it fondly.
Dahlia told Rose that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked to bring people together. Rose expected to get dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon. This made her smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady; she went to many social events.
Before the move, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. But Rose wanted one thing: her independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking for permission. She did not want to be told what to do all the time. Daisy understood this.
Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They all agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to make good choices, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If either of them made a mistake, they would talk about it.
Rose was not a wild child. She had a few good friends, and her school reports were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. This was her fourth school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this would be her last school before finishing. For Rose, it was a new beginning in her life.

112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger says that her primary school teacher first thought she might write a novel. “I believed that writing a book was a big achievement because it seemed very hard. I didn’t know what other teenagers were doing, like going to the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought, ‘I should try this now.’ The novel I started then is about to be published. I recently told my old teacher about it, and she was surprised. She thought I would write a book when I was 30 or 40. I didn’t understand why I should wait to do something I might be good at.”
It is a winter afternoon in the offices of Charlotte’s publishers. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a big achievement: it has a strong story and is exciting. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, shows that it was written by a teenager. The public relations person for the book is with us in case Charlotte needs help. But she does not need any support. She is confident, with a bright face and smart ideas, but she is also calm and not too proud.
Charlotte knows she is young. I ask her about the important questions she talks about in her book. “I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share with my readers,” she laughs. “I don’t think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don’t think I am very wise. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.”
She has a theory about teenagers and how they are often shown in books. She believes there are three types of teenagers in stories. “There’s the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the world, and the awkward teenager who struggles socially.” Reading about these types annoyed her. “What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who are not lacking in some way. Some writers give the impression that teenagers don’t know who they are because they lack experience. This can hurt their self-belief.”
Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost made her stop writing. “Books by my favorite fantasy writers talk about deep things in life. I asked myself: do I have to write like this to write a good book?” However, she likes a book called How Not to Write a Novel. “It says that if the reader can guess what will happen, the suspense is gone.”
Some people might think that Charlotte’s parents, who are both journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. She knows she is lucky because it is hard to get anyone to read a first novel, no matter the author’s age. “Every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, you are on your own. In the end, writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take anything for granted,” Charlotte says."

“Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,” said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. “Now, who wants to go first?” The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went up the ramp fast and flew into the air, arms waving. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed hard, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. “Remember,” Gareth said kindly, “speed can be unpredictable.” 
Maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. On past skiing holidays, I liked to practice turns in the snow. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skate parks. I thought it looked fun, but I was afraid to try because I didn’t know how. Then my parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a training center for freestyle skiing in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students jumped and tried new tricks, landing in foam cubes – not a real way to learn for the slopes. 
After practicing indoors, students went outside to try their moves for real. “Progression is inevitable!” the center’s slogan said. “Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,” said Gareth. “But remember – if you land on the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.” The ‘knuckle’ is the flat area behind the jump before the slope goes down to the landing zone. If you land in the zone, you keep moving forward, which is better. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, and that hurts. So, speed is important.
At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to slow down, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt tired. “You need to control the jump, not let it control you,” said Gareth. 
Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, but bouncing was fun. Some drills copied moves we would do while ski-jumping, and others helped us learn ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing in the air. Gareth gave us tips. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before jumping, and then I found myself in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. 
We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more mistakes before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment, I felt proud. But that feeling didn’t last long. On my last run of the day, I made myself go fast as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed in the right spot. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope, no longer attached to my feet."
114,B2,"'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold tightly to the safety harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly goes up. There is a pause. Then, it drops quickly, and your stomach feels funny. You go fast forward, turn left, and then go upside down. You feel scared and scream. But you chose to come here, just like many other people who pay to enter the theme park. 
Amusement parks are very popular and make a lot of money. To create exciting rides, there are many people working behind the scenes. These include engineers, designers, and marketing experts. Being a rollercoaster designer sounds fun, but it is a big job. They must make sure the ride is exciting but also safe for everyone. 
Many people think rollercoasters are getting more thrilling, but most of the ideas used today were created by a designer named John Miller in the early 1900s. In the past, rollercoasters were very extreme, but now designers must follow certain rules. I talked to three experts about rollercoasters. Professor Brendan Walker, a ‘thrill engineer’, said the skill is in putting all the parts together. Dr. John Roberts explained that it is important to make people feel like they are being thrown around but still safe. 
To create a great ride, the teams must tell a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, while adding exciting features like tall heights and steep drops. Professor Walker said that in creative jobs, experience and trying things out are very important. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that it helps to love thrills when designing rollercoasters. 
I asked if rollercoaster designers will use new technology like virtual reality. Walker said we should not expect too much from it. He explained that while new technology can make rides more exciting, the real experience of the rollercoaster will always be the most important part.'"

At 25, Miranda Ellington has done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both things with her busy schedule. She says, “Dancing again reminds me of being in the studio and following the orders of strict choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers can forget what it is like to rehearse all day.”
As a choreographer, Miranda teaches and enjoys working with young students. She says, “A new dancer is often open to new ideas. Working with students can be easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed, but they do not always know their strengths and weaknesses. This means they can accept even tough criticism. Sometimes they challenge what I say, but I like their honest feedback.”
When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. She says, “There may be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers do not respond well to the music, it can be frustrating, but I must find solutions. I cannot just choose a new piece of music. I wish I could be more experimental and change the music to make rehearsals better. But now, I always work on big productions where the music is already chosen.”
Miranda does not want to stay with one place. She says, “It is important to meet new people. But I must remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. I have to change how I work each time I go somewhere new. This helps me not to get stuck in my ways.”
The conversation turns to a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says, “There have been beautiful documentaries before that were not true. This one shows real life in a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections. I smiled because I understood her struggle. She knows she is not doing it right but cannot make her body do what is needed. It is hard to watch, but it is real. People do not see how much work and dedication ballet needs.”
I ask Miranda what makes a great dance production. She says, “It is when everything comes together – the music, the costumes, the lights, and the dancers. Perfection is hard to achieve, but aiming high is important. It helps you get away with some mistakes. I have worked on shows where the dance steps are good, but the costumes or props are distracting. That is disappointing.”
Miranda has done many types of work, so I ask if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She replies, “People want to label you, but I do not understand why. There is a trend to focus on one area of expertise. I do not follow that, but maybe one day I will be known for one thing. For now, I want to explore more.”"
116,B1,"'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on TV. I said that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to see and do? This conversation gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was giving away his old sofa, and it became the star of my film. I added three wheels and some cables to the sofa and used old seatbelts to hold it on my shoulders. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and encouraged me to keep going. I have walked on many trips in recent years, but this was very different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and I could stop at cafés to relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of sitting on a rock. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing this for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I prefer to tell them how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can see the film on my website.'"
117,B1,"'When I read about swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be good for me. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a ticket for one person, because the islands are popular with families. I told him I would not be alone for long; I would join ten others to swim around the small islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and let me on the boat. 
Our group had sent emails to each other before we started, but there was not much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would be with us, and they showed us how to communicate with it. We swam a short distance to split us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first long swim of 1.5 km. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swum in rivers, but I had never swum long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group, not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first swim, and I was very happy when I did it on my own. 
The next days had a routine: jumping in, swimming at a comfortable speed, and stopping to look at the beautiful scenery. As the swims got longer, I swam faster and enjoyed them more. I felt I did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come back next year.'"
118,B1,"""Being a flight attendant is not easy, but it is a great job. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with amazing people, I have a lot of free time, and my job is never boring. This makes it a good job for a young person like me! 
When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. Sometimes I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to the passengers. Some of them let me help. 
Later, when I wanted to change from my banking job, I remembered this. I looked for a new job and went to an interview. There were many young people there, and many got the job. They were also changing careers like me. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my skills and my work experience, not just that I loved to travel. Because of this, I got the job!
I think this job is good for many people. There are many reasons to like it, but free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard. There is a saying: 'No one is finished until everyone is finished.' It feels like a big family. Even if we do not see each other all the time, we are still close. 
When I am not working, I do not take work home. If I have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!"""
119,B1,"""At the summer camp where I work, I enjoy seeing the children do things they thought they could not do. Most of the children can swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel nervous, but after some encouragement, they try and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. 
At the start of the week, some children miss home. It is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds who feel this way. We do not let them use their mobile phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch. When they ask again after dinner, we say it is too late to call now and they can do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time.
Sometimes, it is not just the children who feel lonely. Some parents call a lot to ask how their child is doing, which is not needed. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other things, so we tell the parents to call back later. We also get some children who come dressed in expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."""
120,B1,"'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after five years in the USA, where it won the title of ‘Best Musical’ four times! Doing the show with all-British actors was not easy. The UK has more rules about how many performances young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. 
The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night. Everyone wants to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially with a beautiful Gibson guitar.’ He told me that the young actors are very busy. ‘We have normal school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends,’ he said. 
What do his friends think of the show? ‘My whole class came! The theatre has special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! 
The young actors were already musicians, with some playing different instruments, but none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is worth seeing.'"
