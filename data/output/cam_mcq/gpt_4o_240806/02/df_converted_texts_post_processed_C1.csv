1,C2,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—when you announce your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing everything online might have negative consequences. The internet offers many exciting possibilities: wealth, fame, and more. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can get lost. It might sound depressing, but don't lose hope. There is guidance from early internet users who explored these challenges before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, faced job losses, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations and dangers of fame. They have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by grad students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall's approach was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some might call him an exhibitionist, his work had a certain beauty that could be considered art. However, one day, visitors found his site replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" Hall had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent her blog's address to all the vice presidents at her company, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to publicly criticize the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem intriguing. 
At first, the film seemed harmless, with scientists saying that new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher claimed that thoughts could change the shape of water molecules. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing, but scientists usually say, ""Give me a break."" 
The idea that thoughts can affect water is amazing and could mean new forces are at work in the universe. But we need solid proof that this effect is real, and pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the film's claims weren't strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to energy that comes from nowhere, linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. 
Recent discoveries show that the universe is indeed stranger than we thought. Astronomers found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" On a more practical level, neuroscientists discovered that our conscious perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans originated and why they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.
Science is far from complete. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some top physicists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people think the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"Writing novels and short stories are two different experiences for me. Writing novels is challenging, like planting a forest, while writing short stories is enjoyable, like planting a garden. Both activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade and the leaves rustle in the wind, sometimes turning golden. In the garden, flowers bloom, attracting bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.
Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I feel like writing short stories, and after completing a set of short stories, I want to focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. It seems like they use different parts of the brain, and I need time to switch between them.
I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories at first, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers liked seeing this different side of me. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my start as a short-story writer.
One joy of writing short stories is that they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story, though revisions can be endless. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I'll make it through. So, writing short stories is a refreshing change.
Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It's often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. If an idea doesn't work out, it's okay. Not every short story is a masterpiece, even for great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. This is comforting because you can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.
For me, short stories are like an experimental lab for writing novels. It's hard to experiment within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows or faint footprints I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are guideposts to my heart, and sharing these feelings with readers makes me happy as a writer."
4,C2,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often falls short. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is clear to experts, its dangers are often misunderstood, and its importance is both overestimated and underestimated. People often ignore its mistakes or exaggerate them. Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are constantly changed or replaced, much like new music styles that are first mocked but later accepted. Scientists often experience jealousy and anger. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. We will admire these ideas but also question them, recognizing both human creativity and limitations. Science is always changing. Scientists often disprove each other's theories, usually without affecting society. But sometimes, big changes challenge our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned this view, showing that observing the universe can change it. Some people think science can't fully explain the universe, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe. Maybe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature, sometimes disrupting it without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the world their children will live in and even the children themselves. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. Deciding the future is not just for philosophers; it affects national budgets, health, and even life on Earth."
5,C2,"Since around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped increasing and even decreased in some cases. This raised doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed book. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can coexist, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. Historically, whenever new technologies emerged, people predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. In 1894, people speculated that phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, television, and smartphones, all supposedly threatening print books at different times. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the book's death often appears during technological changes, reflecting our hopes and fears about these changes. We form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we bond with objects like books, TVs, and computers, sometimes even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. When new technology, like e-readers, emerges, it not only signals economic and social change but also affects our bond with familiar things. As technology advances, we often miss what we used to have, which is why industries develop around retro products. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people sought original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, including their unique smell. This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power to change and our resistance to it. We often use familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings, to understand change. These stories are easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our personal world and identity."
6,C2,"For nearly a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest minds from the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, showing them as creatures of habit, much like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you nap afterward."" This book focuses on the circumstances of creative work, not the work itself; it’s about the process rather than the meaning. It’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about your inner self, and I agree. 
In this book, I explore questions I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to dedicate yourself entirely to a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to be more efficient, as my dad always says, ""work smarter, not harder""? I don’t claim to answer these questions definitively—some may only be resolved individually—but I provide examples of how various successful people have tackled similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas are built through small daily efforts and how working habits affect the work itself.
The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it’s really about routines. Routines might seem ordinary or thoughtless, like being on autopilot. However, a good routine can help you make the most of limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A solid routine can guide your mental energy and help you avoid being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and couldn’t stick to a schedule. 
This book was born from my own procrastination. One Sunday, while trying to write a story for the architecture magazine I worked for, I ended up tidying my desk and making coffee instead. As a morning person, I’m focused in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for other writers’ work schedules. I found them easily and thought someone should collect these stories, which led to my Daily Routines blog and now this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of routines I found in biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more thoroughly, keeping the original’s brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews, or I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t exist without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars, whose research I used. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
79,C2,"In recent years, both in the UK and internationally, there has been a trend in higher education to involve students in research early in their studies. This shift acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists making big discoveries. Instead, research is a fundamental way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only in academics but also in the workplace because they help us think critically about the world and our work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.
Research can range from groundbreaking, complex studies by highly trained experts to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about various topics. Most students have already done some research, whether in school projects or everyday life, like planning a holiday or fixing things at home. In college, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, critically evaluating information, and forming your own ideas are key learning activities.
Some students might find this challenging, especially if they come from educational backgrounds where knowledge is seen as fixed and learned from authority figures like teachers and textbooks. In places like the UK, US, and much of Europe and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This approach can be intimidating, but critical thinking is crucial in research. We need to engage with others' research, think critically about it, and not just accept it as fact. It's important to test ideas, check if they are logical and supported by evidence, and not rely uncritically on information from others."
80,C2,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London gathered in coffee houses to discuss topics like chemistry and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso talked about modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities are creative hubs, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. 
Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. It's known that city life is tiring, but new research shows it can also dull our thinking. One major issue is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for the brain. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they offer a mental break from city life.
This research is timely because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we are packed into crowded urban areas. This has significant effects on our mental and physical health and changes how we think. Walking down a busy street requires your brain to manage many things: distracted people, traffic, and the complex city layout. These tasks drain our mental energy because they force us to constantly focus and refocus our attention. 
Natural environments, on the other hand, don't demand as much mental effort. This concept is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.
Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and sought to integrate nature into urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer a break from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While people try various methods to boost cognitive performance, like energy drinks or office redesigns, simply walking in nature seems to be more effective.
Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain centers of intellectual life. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that challenge our attention also drive innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities fuels creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a hub of intellectual breakthroughs, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, thrive as creative centers. Less crowded cities might generate less innovation over time.
The challenge is to reduce the negative psychological effects of city life while keeping its benefits. After all, there are times when people crave the excitement of the city over the calm of nature."
81,C2,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious to say that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to support this idea. However, I believe that the study of the mind shouldn't be limited to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in human thinking. Archaeology shows us that things like stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and shaping the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might also be part of the mind.
It's easy to see why people equate the mind with the brain. Most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their usual surroundings. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limitations of brain-scanning machines. But this approach often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny the importance of the brain in cognition, but I believe the mind is more than just the brain. We should explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world.
This is where my theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become extensions of our minds, like when we use clay to make numbers or a stone to create a tool. It also looks at how these interactions have changed over time and what they mean for our thinking. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of what objects do for the mind.
Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does this person's self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be continuous. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick plays an active role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence is adaptable and can change by incorporating new technologies.
I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, the 'stick' has taken many forms, from ancient stone tools to the internet. Its main role has been as a pathway, not a boundary. Through these 'sticks,' humans explore and understand the world, and also shape their future. This is different from how animals use tools. For humans, tools satisfy our curiosity and desire to learn. This unique human trait explains why we create things and how these things, in turn, shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world.
I want to include materiality in our understanding of cognition. MET offers a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from stone axes to smartphones, have defined and transformed us. Mind-changing technology might sound futuristic, but humans have been using it since we first evolved."
