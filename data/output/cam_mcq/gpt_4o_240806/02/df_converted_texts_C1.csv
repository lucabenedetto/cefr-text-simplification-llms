1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—when you announce your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing everything online might have negative consequences. The internet offers many exciting possibilities: wealth, fame, and more. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can get lost. It might sound depressing, but don't lose hope. There is guidance from early internet users who explored these challenges before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, faced job losses, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations and dangers of fame. They have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by grad students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall's approach was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some might call him an exhibitionist, his work had a certain beauty that could be considered art. However, one day, visitors found his site replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" Hall had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent her blog's address to all the vice presidents at her company, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to publicly criticize the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem intriguing. 

At first, the film seemed harmless, with scientists saying that new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher claimed that thoughts could change the shape of water molecules. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing, but scientists usually say, ""Give me a break."" 

The idea that thoughts can affect water is amazing and could mean new forces are at work in the universe. But we need solid proof that this effect is real, and pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the film's claims weren't strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to energy that comes from nowhere, linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. 

Recent discoveries show that the universe is indeed stranger than we thought. Astronomers found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" On a more practical level, neuroscientists discovered that our conscious perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans originated and why they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.

Science is far from complete. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some top physicists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people think the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,"Writing novels and short stories are two different experiences for me. Writing novels is challenging, like planting a forest, while writing short stories is enjoyable, like planting a garden. Both activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade and the leaves rustle in the wind, sometimes turning golden. In the garden, flowers bloom, attracting bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.

Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I feel like writing short stories, and after completing a set of short stories, I want to focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. It seems like they use different parts of the brain, and I need time to switch between them.

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories at first, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers liked seeing this different side of me. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my start as a short-story writer.

One joy of writing short stories is that they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story, though revisions can be endless. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I'll make it through. So, writing short stories is a refreshing change.

Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It's often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. If an idea doesn't work out, it's okay. Not every short story is a masterpiece, even for great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. This is comforting because you can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story.

For me, short stories are like an experimental lab for writing novels. It's hard to experiment within a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows or faint footprints I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are guideposts to my heart, and sharing these feelings with readers makes me happy as a writer."
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often falls short. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is clear to experts, its dangers are often misunderstood, and its importance is both overestimated and underestimated. People often ignore its mistakes or exaggerate them. Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are constantly changed or replaced, much like new music styles that are first mocked but later accepted. Scientists often experience jealousy and anger. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. We will admire these ideas but also question them, recognizing both human creativity and limitations. Science is always changing. Scientists often disprove each other's theories, usually without affecting society. But sometimes, big changes challenge our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned this view, showing that observing the universe can change it. Some people think science can't fully explain the universe, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe. Maybe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature, sometimes disrupting it without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the world their children will live in and even the children themselves. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. Deciding the future is not just for philosophers; it affects national budgets, health, and even life on Earth."
5,"Since around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped increasing and even decreased in some cases. This raised doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed book. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can coexist, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. Historically, whenever new technologies emerged, people predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. In 1894, people speculated that phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, television, and smartphones, all supposedly threatening print books at different times. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the book's death often appears during technological changes, reflecting our hopes and fears about these changes. We form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we bond with objects like books, TVs, and computers, sometimes even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. When new technology, like e-readers, emerges, it not only signals economic and social change but also affects our bond with familiar things. As technology advances, we often miss what we used to have, which is why industries develop around retro products. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people sought original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, including their unique smell. This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power to change and our resistance to it. We often use familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings, to understand change. These stories are easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our personal world and identity."
6,"For nearly a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest minds from the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, showing them as creatures of habit, much like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you nap afterward."" This book focuses on the circumstances of creative work, not the work itself; it’s about the process rather than the meaning. It’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about your inner self, and I agree. 

In this book, I explore questions I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to dedicate yourself entirely to a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to be more efficient, as my dad always says, ""work smarter, not harder""? I don’t claim to answer these questions definitively—some may only be resolved individually—but I provide examples of how various successful people have tackled similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas are built through small daily efforts and how working habits affect the work itself.

The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it’s really about routines. Routines might seem ordinary or thoughtless, like being on autopilot. However, a good routine can help you make the most of limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A solid routine can guide your mental energy and help you avoid being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and couldn’t stick to a schedule. 

This book was born from my own procrastination. One Sunday, while trying to write a story for the architecture magazine I worked for, I ended up tidying my desk and making coffee instead. As a morning person, I’m focused in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for other writers’ work schedules. I found them easily and thought someone should collect these stories, which led to my Daily Routines blog and now this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of routines I found in biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more thoroughly, keeping the original’s brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews, or I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t exist without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars, whose research I used. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of an unexpected change in his family's plans when he was six. His father, worried about rising interest rates and their mortgage, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. There, on a rainy August day, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. This discovery sparked his interest in palaeontology. By the end of his university studies, he knew he wanted to focus on the earliest periods of life, not the more popular Jurassic era with dinosaurs. He was fascinated by the beginnings of life, studying ancient, delicate creatures in rocks.

After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard was concerned about finding a job, especially in a place he wanted to work. He was confident in his abilities but knew that getting a job in academia wasn't always fair. When a position at Tavistock College in London opened, he applied, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't attend due to an accident. His replacement on the panel disliked the absent professor and made sure Howard got the job instead. Howard was initially grateful for the unexpected support, but later learned the truth. He was slightly disappointed but relieved to have the job he wanted.

Howard often compared the predictability of his scientific work with the unpredictability of life. He realized how strangers could unexpectedly change his life, like when his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Frustrated, he postponed the lecture and went for coffee, where he met a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This meeting led him to learn about a new collection of fossils that would become his biggest challenge and secure his career. If not for the theft, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding the funds to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. In his office at Oxford University, he mentions having ice cream made from bee larvae at home. Although they look like maggots, they taste 'slightly nutty and floral.' Making insects a normal part of our diet is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. His research is quietly but significantly changing what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurant menus. Spence and his colleagues, through a field called gastrophysics, examine in detail how we experience food and drink. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates, and background noise all influence taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers many interesting insights for anyone who enjoys eating. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant tends to enjoy their meal the most. Also, we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others. Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and low-tech, which allows him to work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his funding comes from a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less prestigious in universities. However, now that universities need to show their work has real-world impact, this type of research is valued. Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often without customers noticing. Gradual changes are made so that regular consumers don't detect a difference. Spence explains that if people are told about these changes, they focus on the taste and may not like it as much. Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a big food company. At the time, people thought combining science and food was strange, even though food is inherently scientific. Blumenthal helped change this perception. Together, they created the 'Sound of the Sea' dish, inspired by Spence's research on how sound affects flavor. Interestingly, the Italian futurists tried similar ideas a century ago, but they didn't become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. For instance, his research shows that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon pair music with meals served to passengers. Last year, a brand released an app that played music while ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says is a common oversight. One might wonder what dinner parties are like at Spence's home. They've had meals with rabbit fur on the cutlery and used remote-controlled lights. They've also experimented with sound and drinks to see how different pitches affect taste. For Spence, home, shops, food events, and international conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, fake facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most of these things on our own. We are juggling many roles while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows, with the help of our smartphones. These devices encourage us to fill every spare moment with activity. However, there's a problem. We think we are multitasking, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried that something will fall apart. Although we believe we are achieving a lot, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can overstimulate the brain and cause confusion. Multitasking also creates a craving for distraction, rewarding the brain for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to stay focused, is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask can harm our cognitive performance. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an unread email sits in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are greater than those from fatigue. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, instead of the hippocampus, which organizes facts and ideas. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is hard on our brains. Even small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones, leading to poor decisions after making many small ones. In discussions with business leaders, scientists, and writers, email is often mentioned as a problem. It's not the email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and accomplish other tasks."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they struggle to find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions were mostly ignored. Scientists focused on animal behaviors and their outcomes, not on whether animals had feelings or moral systems. But recently, this has started to change. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This shift has reached popular science books, such as Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has sparked a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a conscience, a sense of right and wrong? 

In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Those that opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure, jumping and kicking, than those that had help. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does this mean for how we produce and consume beef? The observations are clear, but their interpretation is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the brink of a major ethical revolution. Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, suggests we should rethink our view of animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail argues against attributing human traits to animals. The disagreement is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is difficult, can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, or a bat midwife?

Balcombe describes an experiment with starlings, a type of bird, which he believes shows they can get depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other lived in small, barren ones. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. Later, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the birds in the comfortable cages ate them. Balcombe concluded that the poor conditions made the starlings pessimistic. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He compares our current view of animals to past racism, suggesting we will one day look back with regret. If he were alone in this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning, who wrote a textbook on animal behavior, notes that opinions on animal thought have swung back and forth over time. He warns against letting personal biases influence the debate."
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way of engaging with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K. and former computer science lecturer, notes that while technology helps us store and process information, it might also change how we solve complex problems, making deep thinking harder. We are often exposed to poor but appealing ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Surprisingly, having more data doesn't always lead to better knowledge or decisions.

The National Endowment for the Arts reports a decline in literary reading, which some, like Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believe may reduce critical thinking. She suggests that focusing more on visual media and multitasking can detract from concentrating on one thing. However, there is no clear answer yet on how technology affects critical thinking. Technology's impact is complex, and different uses can have different effects. For instance, a computer game might either help or hinder critical thinking. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links might prevent deeper thought.

Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that while reading enhances imagination and critical thinking, visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media don't allow time for reflection or analysis, which can lead to underachievement, especially in younger people.

How society views technology influences its perception of critical thinking. This is especially true with video games. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games, often seen as unhealthy, can actually be good learning tools. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in realistic virtual settings. These games allow players to explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise.

In the digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford, when not writing about how we should live, works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy institutions. His first book praised the benefits of manual work, while his latest book is a philosophical guide on dealing with modern life. Crawford was inspired to write it after noticing ads on a credit card machine while entering his pin. He realized that these constant demands on our attention are hard to avoid. We should be able to decide what we focus on, but often we can't because of things we're not fully aware of. It's becoming harder to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, we isolate ourselves and avoid simple interactions like talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we often experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us and take over our desires. This concern is shared by many, like office workers overwhelmed by emails. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us, a common experience at dinners where we feel drawn to our phones. There's no scientific proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we're more aware of other things we could be doing. While it seems like a technological issue, Crawford believes technology just amplifies our self-focus. With endless choices, our self-control is tested, affecting our social lives. We prefer texting over talking to avoid real conversations. By interacting with representations of people instead of real people, we risk losing something important in society. Screens are only part of the issue. Crawford uses his gym as an example: it used to have one music player for everyone, which could cause tension. Now, people use earbuds and the gym has lost its social aspect. Real connections often happen through resolving conflicts, like different music tastes. Crawford suggests two solutions: regulating noise and distractions in public spaces, and engaging in skilled practices for a more fulfilling life. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who engage with the real world. No representation can match the feel of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under tires. These roles require good judgment and managing others in the same space. Engaging with the world this way makes manufactured experiences seem less appealing. It's not about everyone becoming a chef, but about using your judgment. This approach offers benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions is tiring and reduces focus on important things. Focusing on one thing makes it easier to pay attention to others."
13,"Text: ""When someone asks, 'What do you do for a living?' it's a common way to start a conversation. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, this question is easy to answer, but for a philosopher like me, it's a bit tricky. Calling yourself a philosopher can sound pretentious because it might seem like you're claiming to have special knowledge or enlightenment. This isn't true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this stereotype makes me pause. Why does this image of philosophers exist? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others' actions and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation, or a philosophical life, was the best. While few modern philosophers agree completely, philosophy is still linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, 'The unexamined life is not worth living,' meaning that just accepting cultural norms without questioning them is unsatisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make decisions. However, living an examined life doesn't mean you have to read a lot of philosophical books or spend all your time thinking. It means looking closely at your daily experiences to see if they are truly important. You don't need to be a wise person living apart from society to do this. In fact, examining life is practical and should involve sharing knowledge, as it's key to a good life. Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from everyday life, especially for those without formal training. This isn't entirely philosophers' fault; universities focus on expensive and hard-to-access journals, so philosophers often only share ideas with other experts. To outsiders, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. If philosophers once challenged this view, many have stopped. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy focus on specific, technical debates, explaining them to non-experts is very difficult. Philosophy, in some cases, has withdrawn from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an 'ethicist' because I work in ethics, which is about evaluating human actions. But recently, I've felt this title doesn't fully describe my work, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. This is a new development in philosophy: ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if an action is 'ethical' or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often explore them. However, philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start with whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people examine the actions and beliefs that shape their lives. Sometimes this confirms what we know; other times, it challenges our beliefs. Either way, by examining these ideas, we contribute to everyone's benefit."""
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and others who value food might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. Historically, though, philosophers have often used food as a way to discuss other topics. When philosophers talked about eating, it was usually a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food actually explore other, loosely related ideas. 

Take the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, for example. He promoted seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in various aspects of life. Yet, his name is now closely linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites, likely because businesses think it will attract customers if their products are associated with famous philosophers.

Food is inherently social and cultural. It doesn't just appear; it comes from historical contexts and is shared with our communities. These communities provide dining companions and the systems for growing and distributing food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than any other product, making it a clear topic for philosophical study.

Once food is prepared, critics start discussing and writing about it. But why do they have such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food isn't a special skill; influential food critics are just better at describing tastes. Philosophically, the mechanisms of taste perception haven't been studied much, as most research has focused on vision.

Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We often call paintings or music beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in aesthetic discussions like sculpture or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike art or music, which lasts over time. This makes it hard to consider food as an object of aesthetic value.

There are many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices, which is a valid area of study.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of personal relationships. In home kitchens, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional cooks, however, have responsibilities to their employers and the food. Their kitchens are for qualified staff, and their relationships are professional.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by appreciating others' food and by forming personal connections through shared meals, a practice with a long history in diplomacy. The essay includes many examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, an American game designer, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were no longer fun or challenging, so he started thinking about how they could change. He wondered if board games could have a storyline or if decisions made in one game could affect future games. He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this version, decisions made during the game have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at certain points. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said, ""You could point to the board and say: 'Right here! You did this!'""

Daviau was later asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was praised, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was the first game not based on an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th to mid-19th century), players explore and conquer new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story intact. They hire testers to see how the game plays out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said, ""It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.""

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a niche interest. He said, ""I thought it was different and good, but also strange and unexpected. I thought only a few people would like it."" However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He sees it as a major advancement in game design. ""It's a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement,"" he said. ""There's nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and legacy games offer that constantly.""

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the unfolding adventure was more important than concerns about the game's longevity. ""At first, I was worried about changing and damaging the board,"" he said. ""But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don't watch the same movie twice, do they? You're buying an experience. It's like the storytelling in video games."" The legacy format is influenced by video games and the popularity of episodic TV series. Daviau, who once wanted to be a TV writer, moved into advertising and then game design, but he always loved storytelling. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ""You need to know how it starts and ends, but also have more than just an outline,"" he said.

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is curious to see how others will develop the idea. But he also thinks people might soon want something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, believes the legacy format is groundbreaking. ""It's the kind of idea that changes how you think about board games,"" he said."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like something from a children's movie, was shared widely online. Stories like this, involving animals like rats and llamas, are fun because they let us imagine animals as being like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very intelligent despite looking so different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

People often think that seeing animals as human-like is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that the real problem is ""anthropodenial""—refusing to see the human-like traits in animals. He has studied animal behavior for decades and found that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often think.

In the past, people believed animals had complex minds. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said that the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind.

In the 20th century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines that responded to stimuli or as robots with instincts. People who thought animals had inner lives were considered unscientific. This view coincided with humans destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.

Fortunately, de Waal believes we are now recognizing that animal intelligence is on the same spectrum as human intelligence, even if it's not at the same level. He notes that recent decades have brought a lot of new knowledge about animal cognition, shared widely on the internet. The best tests of animal intelligence consider the specific traits and skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts, while we need apps to find our phones. In her book ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us on how many color patterns we can make on our skin. Seeing us fail, it might think we are not very smart.

De Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape story. While octopuses have escaped tanks before, he thinks it's unlikely Inky knew how to find a drain leading to the ocean. However, he acknowledges that viral stories can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers (a food they like) and others got grapes (which they like even more), the monkeys with cucumbers got upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but what really convinced people was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our human minds work in interesting ways."
17,"Robotics, once just a topic in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialization. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for years, but experts say we are close to a big change where robots will be used in many more areas. However, many people are not ready for this change. While most people think robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, they also believe their own jobs will still exist. This is not true; robotic automation will affect every industry soon. 

For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a job that would take two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a startup called Simbe Robotics introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check if products are stocked and priced correctly. 

Supporters of robotic automation say that robots still need humans to service and program them, which will create new, high-skilled jobs. Critics, however, worry that we are not ready for the loss of human interaction in jobs. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will start making laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but there will still be a lack of skilled workers.

Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be most affected by automation. He suggests that they should retrain themselves instead of relying on the government to protect their jobs. As technology advances, new types of robots will enter the consumer market, like robots that live with us at home and interact with us in complex ways. This presents a great opportunity for businesses but also requires new safety and privacy regulations.

With many jobs at risk, education is key to preparing for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive in this changing job market."
18,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered the question of why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response highlights a common curiosity: why do people engage in such dangerous activities? Mallory's answer might inspire some to pursue their dreams, as it challenges people to face the unknown. The real value of his answer is its simplicity, suggesting that climbing might be about adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules, from bouldering to climbing Himalayan peaks. He argued that the style of climbing, like using more or less equipment, should match the rules of the specific climbing ""game."" Over the years, this idea has become central to discussions about climbing in the West, influencing everything from magazines to debates.

For many climbers, the love of climbing comes from the sense of freedom it provides. However, climbing can also be restrictive, like being stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and confining. Some argue that the simplicity of having limited options is a form of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is part of our nature, an evolutionary trait that drives us to take on challenges and test our limits, despite the risks. The joy of climbing, then, is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor adds that climbing can help develop virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing can help cultivate these virtues, which are valuable in everyday life.

Another perspective is that climbers who rely only on themselves, without help from others or technology, must be fully committed to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson argue that independent climbs, which are harder and riskier, deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or artificial aids like bottled oxygen. This view has sparked debate, as it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Finally, some climbers describe being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone"" during climbs. The physical effort, meditative focus, and intuitive problem-solving involved in climbing are similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which aim for a state of perfect peace. This connection offers another reason why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known as an intellectual and sometimes serious person who focused on European piano music. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he rarely taught. People close to him saw a playful side, but this was not often seen in his concerts. His life was a disciplined routine of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel didn't take the request seriously because he had taught very few students and didn't see a reason to start. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, ""You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk."" However, something about Kit, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played very well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital where he played beautifully. Brendel thought, ""I have to make time for him."" Kit's performance was rare because he had a clear understanding of the music and the subtlety needed to play it.

As Brendel steps back from public life, Kit is slowly entering it, with Brendel being careful to prevent him from burning out too soon. Kit, now 19, is always busy outside of lessons, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under the watchful eye of his mother. He also composes music. Brendel believes this is important because writing music helps you read it better. He noticed Kit has an amazing memory and is a great sight reader. More importantly, Kit listens to his own playing and to Brendel's advice. He not only understands what Brendel means but can also apply it throughout a piece of music.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations. He is upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, as this can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit plays some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

Now at 80, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He reflects, ""When I was young, I didn't want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them, but there was still room for more, so I continued. Although I don't have the physical strength now, my mind is still active with music I never played. I don't perform anymore, but it's a nice new phase in my life."""
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad's garden wasn't in a dirty city; it was by a river and sloped gently towards the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this—places of escape, peace, and solitude. Grandad's garden wasn't special in terms of features. He didn't have a greenhouse like some neighbors, who made theirs from old window frames with plastic patches where glass was broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved, but he wasn't without humor. He enjoyed using phrases like ""It's immaterial to me"" instead of just saying ""I don't mind."" He probably felt disappointed for not achieving more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn't passionate about. He wasn't very ambitious, though he and my mom once considered moving to Canada, but it didn't happen. However, he was very skilled at home projects, like building bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing furniture. Just as we got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the brass candlesticks on it, which my mother removed, saying they were too fancy. I was never allowed to play the piano; lessons were for my sister. When I asked my mother later why I wasn't given the chance, she simply said, ""You'd never have practiced.""

Given the choice of moors, woods, or river, I usually chose the river. I would explore with a fishing net, wearing last year's sandals with the fronts cut out for my growing toes. I'd find a spot to leave my sandals and picnic, then wade into the water, looking for fish to catch and take home. After failing to keep them alive, I would release them back into the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father mentioned a job opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. He thought I might be interested. Although he might have preferred me to become a carpenter, I like to think he believed things could work out well if I pursued gardening. Even though he didn't like gardening, he had seen my enthusiasm for it and noticed my passion for plants."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on the Isle of Muck, a small Scottish island. I do the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the steep cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen's sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and MacEwen gently pets him. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. He points out the nearby islands to me. ""That one is Eigg,"" he shouts over the wind. ""The one west of it is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do."" I see heavy clouds pouring rain on Rum's large mountains. ""Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay,"" he adds. Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep as rain approaches. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Muck is volcanic, three kilometers long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Our conversation pauses as Tie, the sheepdog, tries to herd the sheep but struggles. ""Away to me, Tie,"" MacEwen instructs, meaning the dog should circle to the right. Tie doesn't listen and goes straight through the flock, causing chaos. ""Tie,"" MacEwen says, disappointed. The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny. Their son Colin, who recently got married, takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. ""They leave the house and only come back when they're hungry,"" Mary says. However, island life has its challenges. Electricity is only available part-time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I get used to it, along with having no mobile phone service. ""There's mobile reception on the hill,"" Mary tells me. ""Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone away."" So I do the same. Life on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians with their instruments. Their concert in the island's tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their feet to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ""Her father bought a small farm on the Isle of Soay after seeing it in a newspaper, without even visiting. He'd never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it."" Did Jenny know anything about farming? ""She was good at typing,"" Lawrence laughs. I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary, who cooks it for dinner. By 7 pm, the fish is on the table, and it's incredibly delicious. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to my next island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months due to rough seas. If my ferry didn't come, I'd be stuck on Muck for two more days. Secretly, I hoped for that, phone or no phone."
22,"The game design industry used to be mainly for computer scientists and self-taught individuals, with few ways to enter it. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now the video games industry is taken seriously. Industry experts are not surprised by this change. However, entering the industry is not easy. Video game spin-offs from new movies need many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it's hard to break into, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says it's tough to make progress in big companies or influence major games. But the industry needs more game designers, not just directors but also those who design systems and set pieces.

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a computer science degree, but Jim disagrees. He believes the only way is to make games. The tools are available, and you need to create something to get a job or succeed independently. Game design is more a lifestyle than a job. Like any creative work, it must be practiced to be real.

Another expert, John Field, offers more options. He agrees with ""just doing it"" but says it's more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense to contribute to this evolving field. Can you succeed alone? ""Maybe, but it's difficult,"" says John. A good postgraduate course in games can help, offering support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all entertainment media and have a strong interest in arts and contemporary culture. They might have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and understand the growing diversity of the medium. Networking is also important to get ahead in games, as in many fields.

The stereotype of a teenage boy playing video games has changed. Now, games are seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. Games are popular with large audiences and are a great way to learn. He sees this area as full of possibilities and opportunities."
23,"Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me, but he didn't force me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It's only through practice that you can score those exciting goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I focus on helping them enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope his habit of kicking them around doesn't mean he's like me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so younger players like me could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never told us, 'This is your big chance,' but we knew it was. Even though I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely a lot on close friends and family. Having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. People sometimes say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' Of course, I've helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong and would be offended if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I enjoy using my money to make life easier for those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off, maybe longer, to do things I haven't been able to do. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father couldn't write anything sellable while we were in Los Angeles because he didn't like the city, and Sam was worried about losing clients and money. So, Sam offered to find us a cheap place to live. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn't popular with day-trippers. The road was not appealing, and the nearby resort, La Carmella, was more attractive for those with some money. Only people who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, the place filled with people. After months of being almost alone, we were suddenly surrounded by activity. My father was busy trying to meet a writing deadline and was in a bad mood. I spent most days on the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We didn't have a dog when we first moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to adopt us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One day, I gave him water, and my father half-heartedly threw a boot at him. Rusty knew he was welcome and stayed. I asked my father who Rusty might belong to, and he said, ""He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often dug up things to bring to me. Sometimes he brought things that weren't buried, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. Rusty also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed tireless. One surfer stood out with her impressive style. She finished her session and came over to me. ""Hi,"" she said, ""why didn’t you join us?"" ""I haven’t got a surfboard,"" I replied. ""You could get one,"" she suggested. ""No money,"" I said. ""You’re British, aren’t you? Are you visiting?"" she asked. ""No, I live here,"" I answered. ""Is your father American?"" ""No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he wrote."" ""No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?"" ""Rufus Marsh,"" I said. ""You mean, Tall as the Morning?"" she asked. I nodded. ""I read that cover to cover,"" she said, looking at me with new interest. I realized people were friendly but only really interested when I mentioned ""Tall as the Morning."""
25,"Violet Hetherington was standing in a long queue at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie, who often traveled, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this time the advice was wrong. An announcement said there was a problem with the computer system, which made the passengers frustrated. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service. Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. This was more troubling than the long wait because all her important contacts were in the phone. She borrowed a phone from a friendly couple behind her to call her son Harry, asking him to check with her neighbor Kristina if the phone was at home. If it wasn’t, she would have trouble finding numbers she needed in New York. Harry often thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding but forgetful. Finally, the queue moved, and Violet handed over her documents to board the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship’s foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy, with fake walnut panels, chandeliers, and airport-style carpets. She took the elevator, crowded with tired passengers, to the twelfth floor. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested, which she had paid extra for to ensure a view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was uncovering the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing striking images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent morning, Maloof stood among these items, realizing he had stumbled upon something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I didn’t know what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily sold it all to someone else.’ For some time, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together Maier’s life story. They contacted local families who employed her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit eccentric, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘On her day off, she’d have her camera around her neck first thing in the morning, and we wouldn’t see her until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person with strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although she wasn’t very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed passionate about her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist who followed her dreams and did what she wanted in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was done for commercial reasons. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. ‘What’s intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this, or did she borrow ideas from those before her?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I progressed as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes weren’t what mattered to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. However, this isn't true for Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she was in the middle of a lot of media attention. Despite being in her twenties, she was very calm. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who then asked, ""What's it about?"" This is a tough question for any author. The Luminaries is set in New Zealand during the 1860s. It involves a series of crimes and a group of 12 men trying to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked her how it felt to be so successful at a young age, she replied modestly. She said it was nice coming from a small country because everyone felt part of her success. She received a lot of support from people back home. She also mentioned that it was frustrating when people didn't see her book as a serious philosophical work. Catton had the idea to write the book in a spiral shape, with each part half the length of the previous one, making it feel faster as it progresses. I asked if it mattered whether readers noticed this. She said she wanted to create a book with hidden patterns that didn't matter, but if readers were interested, they could find them. Despite its experimental structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she didn't plan the story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then find creative ways to resolve them. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers. We also talked about her love for TV drama series. Considering how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue, I asked if she might be interested in screenwriting. She said it could be interesting. Her conversation was lively and filled with enthusiasm. She was especially passionate when talking about her writing and New Zealand. She noticed how her imagination changed when she visited Britain and understood why some writers leave New Zealand for busier places. However, for now, she plans to stay in New Zealand, and many hope it continues to inspire her future novels."
28,"As a child, Jonny Kinkead loved using tools in his dad’s garage and playing with a guitar. These hobbies have become his career for the last forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still fascinated by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood create such a beautiful sound? And how do different types of wood make different sounds? It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to play the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I believed in making things myself. I studied guitars to understand how their shapes and wood types affected the sound and how to build them.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny made from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ‘We designed and built model boats and planes, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use tools like saws and chisels. I also fixed and customized instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar was successful, but he hadn’t thought of making guitars as a career. ‘I was also interested in painting and sculpture,’ he says. After finishing school, he decided to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he recalls. However, he left the course halfway through. ‘I was too independent for it,’ he says. ‘But I realized I wanted to build guitars. It’s like sculpture, but you’re creating sound. It seemed more practical than pure art because you’re making something people use.’ Since then, Jonny has been making guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. Initially, he sold guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a top guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, nearly forty years later, Jonny says he’s ‘still just getting by.’ He admits he can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early days, he worked hard to get noticed. He attended music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which didn’t come naturally to him. Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were worth having,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t considered authentic, even though we’ve always had good instrument-making courses and consistent skills and technology. Now, our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny believes valuable skills can be learned in classes, and he encourages new instrument-makers to take available courses. However, he also thinks there’s no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny advises. ‘If the back is too thin or thick, the sound won’t be good. If you’re taught by someone else, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’"
29,"Any discussion about English conversation usually starts with the weather. This is a tradition, and like many others, I will mention the famous quote by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This observation is still true today. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why English people are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They fail because they mistakenly think that when English people talk about the weather, they are actually interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson notes that English weather is not very exciting, so he finds the English interest in it hard to understand. He points out that the British Isles don't have extreme weather events like tornadoes or monsoons. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because of its unpredictability. He says that living on an island means you can never be sure what the weather will be like. 

My research suggests that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the real point. English people don't talk about the weather because they care about it; instead, it's a way to start conversations and connect with others. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not really about the weather. They are like greetings or conversation starters. This is similar to how monkeys and apes groom each other to bond socially. 

There are specific situations where English people use weather-talk. Some writers say that English people talk about the weather all the time, but that's not true. There are three main situations: as a simple greeting, as a way to start a conversation, or as a topic to fill awkward silences. This means there is a lot of weather-talk, which can make it seem like English people are obsessed with the weather. An English conversation might start with a weather-related greeting, use more weather-talk to break the ice, and then return to it if the conversation slows down. This is why people from other countries, and even some English writers, think that English people are very interested in the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how impressive it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were already interested because they chose this trip over more glamorous destinations like Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers weren't satisfying. Unable to find a historical novel to provide more context and interest about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from 31 years of teaching, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. 

Alice found writing both exciting and a bit scary, but less exhausting than teaching. Her former colleagues envied her because she stayed connected with children through her books. Alice's goal for her novels is to fill a gap in children's fiction. She notes that much of today's adolescent fiction is either dark reality or complete fantasy, like Harry Potter, while her books are neither. Alice always taught English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece alongside the novel ""Tale of Troy,"" driven by her love for children. She enjoys the challenge of turning bored children into interested ones and sees her writing as an extension of teaching.

Alice was inspired to write her first novel partly because her two sons were leaving home and partly due to a suggestion from her head teacher to attend a creative writing course. Initially reluctant, she had to submit a piece of fiction to be accepted. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their unborn child, which got her into the course. Her fellow students praised her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only school report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, a critic and editor, helped her edit the novel. Alice says they complement each other well, as he helps refine her writing while she focuses on creating new scenes."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to a special race. The race would be between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

Jonny was excited about the race as he stood at the start line. ""I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold right now, so I’ll be warm in the car,"" he said. Alistair was also eager, dressed in full winter cycling gear, unlike Jonny who wore jeans and a sweatshirt. Alistair joked, ""I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race began at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to end at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 meters up. This might not be a problem for the car, but Alistair had a tough start with a steep 25% incline. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sped away on his bike, heading straight up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss, while Jonny got into the car and hit the road. They would only see each other again at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s confidence was quickly challenged. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he encountered a giant tractor blocking the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he joked to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!"" After dealing with the tractor, Jonny was back on track, driving into the morning mist.

Meanwhile, Alistair struggled with the steep slope. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched curiously as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun shining, he had a chance to show his skills. He picked up speed, head down and feet on the pedals.

In the car, Jonny faced another challenge. The roads in this part of Yorkshire are very old and not built for speed. He had to carefully navigate narrow corners and drive through a stream on the road. Once past the last village, he raced straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped towards Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the opposite side. 

With his head down and legs pumping, Alistair reached the line and stopped. He looked up and asked the crowd, ""Is he here?"" When they said no, he raised his arms in victory. Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. ""Well done,"" Jonny said, clearly disappointed. ""I’m gutted."""
32,"Playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a unique experience because of the silence. When you bounce the ball on the soft grass, you hear the echo of your shots. The well-kept grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds create a special atmosphere that feels separate from the outside world. This quiet helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to block out everything except the game and the point I'm playing. The silence is only broken by applause and cheers when a point is won. Even though there are 15,000 people watching, I feel distant from them. I am so focused that I forget millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life.

I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach forever, taught me that Wimbledon is the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends that I would play there and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost twice to Federer, including in the final the year before. Losing in 2006 wasn't too hard because I was just happy to be there at age 20. Federer beat me easily because I didn't believe in myself enough. But losing in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have played better, and it was my mindset that let me down. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing is always painful, but it's worse when you know you had a chance. My uncle Toni, who is usually very tough on me, tried to comfort me, saying there would be more chances. I told him he didn't understand, thinking it was my last chance to win. I know a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I felt I missed a big one in 2007. Toni couldn't ease my sadness, but he was right. I got another chance in 2008, just a year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat and that my mindset was strong. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we didn't talk about the match. They knew I was already mentally preparing for it, and I needed that space to be mine alone until the match started."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society helped make her famous by producing articles and TV documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is possibly the most celebrated female scientist of the 20th century, alongside Marie Curie. However, her fame might have overshadowed her real achievements. Many articles and books about her life often focus on her adventurous spirit or her role as a feminist, which can undervalue her work. Based on the number of academic references to her research, the success of her students, and the data from her 40-year study, Jane Goodall should be seen as a leading pioneer in her field and a top zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.

Before Goodall's work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew they ate meat or used tools, and we didn't realize they shared emotions and social systems similar to humans. We also didn't know that chimpanzee communities have different cultural traditions. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her long-term study in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements by biologist Stephen Jay Gould. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. At five years old, in the autumn of 1939, she disappeared one afternoon. The police and neighbors searched for her, and she reappeared with straw in her hair. She explained to her mother that she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity can be seen as the start of her career as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford speaks to me using the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ""I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,"" she says, ""so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.""

Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. ""Many actors, even very famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many of them probably can,"" she says. ""But there’s more to it than that. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get the parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.""

After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a typical acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. ""One day,"" she says, ""the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly—I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits—but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major part."" Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ""Things just happened for me,"" she says. ""In my second film, I was lucky enough to play the main character—and her brother and mother.""

Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors', and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and lots of paperwork, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV.

Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes everything from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. ""Those are hard because you have to sound enthusiastic about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,"" she says. ""They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking—that makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.""

The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel—a recording showing what the artist can do—is essential. ""It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,"" Shirley says. ""There are agencies that specialize in helping voiceover artists put them together."" She claims to have reached the top of her profession through persistence as much as natural talent. ""Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or simply practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.""

For anyone considering a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ""specialist workshops—they cover all types of voiceover."" She also believes a passion for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ""If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,"" she says. ""My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices."""
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a dream job for many kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more practical careers, like becoming a tax lawyer or working in auto parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems unrealistic. Yet, some people do it. 

People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. In my case, I had a typical cartoonist's childhood: I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are basic, but the job is still challenging. You shouldn't try to become a cartoonist unless you feel you can't do anything else. It's easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don't turn down work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don't really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of cartooning? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines, but those days are mostly over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create and sell your work. Cartoonists with average talent but good business skills often do better than artistic geniuses who lack those skills.

I'm surprised by how many people worry about their ideas being stolen, even if they've never sold a cartoon. Some are so afraid that they won't show their work to anyone. Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a 'c' for 'copyright,' circle it, and write your name and the date. But realistically, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of those things was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. Normally, I hate throwing things away, so why did I want to get rid of this guitar? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man approached me, looking confused. He asked, ""Are you really going to throw that away?"" I said yes, already feeling a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I agreed. We went our separate ways, but I felt a deep regret for years afterward.

Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later inside a fish. The email was from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell the guitar back to me. I was so emotional and would have paid any price, but Keith's price was fair. I had forgotten that my dad used to put name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have found this whole situation amusing.

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s when it was very popular. I loved its calming sound, but I struggled to make progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn't need to be a great musician to be a rock star. When I took the guitar out of the box Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and dense, but smaller than I remembered. I felt the urge to stand up and play it with a strap over my shoulder. My fingers remembered the chords, even though I couldn't draw them. My fingertips felt the familiar pain of pressing the strings to play a chord.

The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument, so now that I'm learning it again, I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or perhaps there are others my age with similar experiences. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Insomniacs, whom I interviewed many of, will tell you that sleep is crucial for our mental, physical, and social well-being. Those who struggle to sleep often understand its importance the most. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? They haven't been discussed much. We often lose dreams, especially when we wake up early and miss the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, the stage rich in dreams. Our most vivid and emotionally powerful dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM. When people are deprived of REM, they experience more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests dreams have a purpose. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that interpreting dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the study of dreams shifted to their physical origins. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams better than others. He concluded that dream use increases with interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says dreams help us combine things in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create combinations that break our usual thinking habits. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They 'ignore the obvious and put together things that make unexpected sense ... This is what creativity is,' says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you barely remember, seems to provide fluency and fuel for thought. On those days, words and images come so quickly that my fingers can barely keep up. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. In her studio, which has a stunning sea view, you see empty frames on the walls alongside photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading figure in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate the richness of early 20th-century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Surprisingly, she doesn't keep any of her own work. ""As soon as I finish them, they go,"" she says. Susie is in high demand. Over her 30-year career as a copyist artist, she has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that even art experts can mistake them for the originals. While the originals sell for millions, her copies sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie keeps her clients' names private, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but for others, status is important. One celebrity likes to show off his 'Van Gogh' painting, which is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh.' ""Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,"" she says. ""That's their choice."" Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank and displaying Susie's copy. Susie is honest about her work. She makes her reproductions look as authentic as possible, believing that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as an original is illegal, and although she knows people who have done it, she has never been tempted. People who make fakes often get into trouble. Susie isn't wealthy and has faced challenges, but her situation is more stable now, and risking her reputation doesn't make sense. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. It was good training for her current work and sparked her interest in plants, but it was hard to live on. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets but is glad she found something more financially rewarding. When young artists ask for advice, Susie emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to achieve her skills. Her training allows her to do anything from drawing plants to copying 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art. She now focuses on French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas as her favorites. Susie notes that people often think modern art is easy, almost like child's play. Impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very detailed, which is a challenging combination. Given her talent, it's surprising that Susie doesn't create her own original art. Isn't art about self-expression? And could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She says her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—good, but not exceptional. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest sailor. From a young age, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a strong connection with the boats she sailed around the world, working in perfect harmony with them. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly longed to be back at sea, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop race around the world, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was a small, cramped space where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how she meticulously planned everything, down to the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she needed. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly displayed her stock of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her attention to detail in maintaining the boat was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her entire world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her realize how humans take resources and move on without thinking. 

When I met Ellen at her office, she had just finished a passionate conference call. She explained why it's urgent to act now to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways to stop using them up,"" she said. Initially, her message was about using less, but she later focused on reusing, like promoting reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, Ellen has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she said, ""but I love learning. The current situation is something I can't ignore. Compared to this, sailing seems selfish. This is about finding how my voice can be most helpful. It really matters.""

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she said. ""It defines who I am. At sea, you are connected to everything around you, focused on records, practicalities, and survival. My new message isn't as simple as saying, 'I want to be the fastest around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this mission is more important than anything I've done before."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous among teenagers. He hopes to encourage kids to be more active, as many spend a lot of time on computers and video games. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent. Not many people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these peaks and might complete them before he turns 20.

I talked to some experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agreed that a young climber might be physically strong enough, but they were unsure if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also doubted if a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions during such a climb. The Romeros have heard these concerns before. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that – there's still a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks all the time, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow stronger gives me confidence.'

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it just his father's ambition? Paul insists, 'This isn't about me wanting fame through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, why not now? We regularly check with him to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting challenge. The more daring the record, the more interest it gets. This creates a challenge for Jordan. People might say that focusing on records takes away from the enjoyment, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to engage with the media. This means blogging, doing photo shoots, and giving interviews. He needs to offer something impressive, like climbing Everest. Paul adds, 'If Jordan decides tomorrow that he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we'll end this project and head to the gym.'"
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they aren't listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but even my classmates don't know much about classical music. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't own their music. This is bad news for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells just 300 copies. I find that surprising. So, why is interest in classical music declining, even though it's been around for centuries? Older people often blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who love classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big classical music fan. I like many music styles, but my classical music collection is probably around that 3% mark. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm, with many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like things fast. Experts say we struggle to focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop songs also have lyrics that appeal more to teenagers than long classical pieces without words. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely choose classical. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people are going to classical concerts now, but I doubt many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in different places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why people like classical music more as they get older, but if your parents love something, you might avoid it. Some blame schools for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play it in school orchestras. They practice early and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy playing classical music, but it's not their first choice for listening. When we relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you regret that I’m here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie wouldn’t have minded if she had. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings hidden among trees on a wooded hillside; it seemed confusing at first. Then she noticed the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother replied. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of trailing behind like a dog,"" Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be kicked out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and headed for the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, running her finger along its nose. The next horse caught her attention. ""Aren’t you the best of them all!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. Probably lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They must be nearby."" The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, to Bonnie’s delight. Focused on putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she could see. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m serious because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,"" she confided. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, a breeze brushing her cheek and making it glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he’d jump well."
43,"I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. Cody is a 15-year-old Australian who has already released several successful songs. How did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" He remembers that he was also swimming and surfing every day, which were more important to him at the time. At 13, while attending high school, he posted a few videos online. These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos. Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The response was overwhelming. Cody was also a talented swimmer, training with top coaches and focusing on his sport. But then record labels showed interest, and he faced a tough decision: stay in Australia and continue swimming or take a risk by signing a record deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very difficult for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career,"" he says. ""Can you imagine, at 12 or 13, trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,"" he recalls. ""I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody believes it’s important to have a close group of supportive people around you to stay grounded. Of course, everyone has moments of doubt. ""Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight and travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about that sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they’re here to support and encourage me."" Success in any career comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to opportunities, even when they’re scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be visiting countries I never thought I’d see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like a dream many people have. But I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbag wall, which was there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags into place. Last week, I worked long hours with most of the town's adults, showing I could handle it. But my grandfather didn't seem to notice. With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the wood factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and solid ice downstream. As I changed out of my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn't recognize him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain—a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It's more special to me than having a famous grandfather because only he, my mom, and I know about it. Plus, I have his diary from that trip, which I read before bed. I patted the chain and headed to the kitchen. ""Morning, Rex,"" Mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. ""You're up early for a Saturday. I'll make brunch after your training. Be careful."" ""Thanks, Mom."" I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ""Watch where you're going!"" he shouted. ""Where are you off to?"" ""Sorry, Grandpa. I'm going kayaking."" As if my wetsuit didn't make that clear. As if he didn't see me kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore his temper, but it's getting harder. ""Why train? You didn't win the competition,"" he said. His words stung, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom gave me a sympathetic smile. ""Don't mind him. He's..."" ""...not himself right now,"" I finished for her. I didn't say he's always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a kid, he was my hero, especially when he showed me his National Geographic photos. Those old photos still hang in his room, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don't go in there anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies, and maybe one day, my own photo in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, despite his temper. Mom smiled. ""At least he's coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your dedication, even on cold days!"" I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ""It'll be warmer in South America,"" I said. ""If I find sponsors for my expedition."" She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. In the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study, where there was an unframed painting on the table, leaning against the wall. It was clearly one of Grandpa's works, but it was different from anything he had done before and was obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. It showed a river that took up most of the scene; it wasn't a river she recognized and might not even be real, just imaginary. The picture was strange and shapeless, yet beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green that the eye almost missed, as it was drawn to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it seemed right that way. It felt like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It's got a name."" There was something in her voice—too casual, too detached—that showed her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others figure them out, if they could. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed to have a special meaning, as if they were important to her, but she didn't know why. And there was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it—for him to be so specific. Still, he hasn't finished it yet, so maybe he's going to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially having a name. I guess you can imagine his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to waste time telling every idiot..."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""...every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone who came along, they'd never get any work done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted her, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually just to say the muse wasn't being kind to him that day, or that he'd have to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on, or something like that. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, having any influence over someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that's what happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I'll cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm quite unlucky that way.

What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute, small, painted white with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass-panelled doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet, so I was thrilled when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it needs to stand in a corner.

I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But since Angela is only fifteen, I'll be in my small room for a while. I don't mind; I like my cosy little room. It's like a nest, with a sloping roof and a window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could just cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom...

That's when I had the idea. If I couldn't cut the cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house, secretly taking things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be difficult to meet fans' expectations. People who love the book have strong opinions about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to tell me I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' point of view, not the humans', which made filming more complicated. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when filming them walking across a room or going on a mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' perspective. They wore out many pairs of jeans doing this! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I especially remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there's a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary they didn't have to act. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls' clothes. This made it almost impossible for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn't sit during breaks and couldn't take the dress off because she was sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don't think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren't accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn't allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren't there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people pretending to be friends, and the requests for free tickets to my dad's concerts. ""Everything's going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted—to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the band is here for recording, we're staying permanently. I chose this school because I want to meet regular kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal. 

I walk into the school's main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused but types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That's one good thing—few people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it's printing,"" she says, then hands me the schedule. English Literature is my first class. Great, I like English. I'll be late, though. It's in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night to avoid looking lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already calling roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. Perfect, no one will suspect anything! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oops, maybe not so perfect. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she asks. ""Here."" She smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After discussing the books we'll read this year, she lets us socialize. All teachers should do this. ""So why'd you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have options. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But I can pretend to be normal for a while. ""He's an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I'm Becca, by the way."" And she doesn't seem to care. Perfect."
49,"The average American teenage girl today is expected to do a lot: be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what being a teenager in America is like now. Teenagers can't just go to school and be average; they need to stand out. Being average is not enough, and not having big ambitions is seen as laziness. 

Many adults forget how much pressure teenagers face today. They have lots of homework, tests, extra activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life, says teenager Kristen Loose. Despite these pressures being normal for teenagers now, negative stereotypes about them still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might fit these descriptions, it's not fair to label the whole generation this way.

Kristen Loose points out that people often think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or on their phones. She believes this is mostly wrong. She admits she keeps her phone close, but not just for fun. It's a tool that helps make life easier for teens and those responsible for them. Students are expected to have instant access to the world and be reachable at all times, which can look like phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can work anywhere and do homework on the go. Schoolwork and activities now need attention 24/7, adding to the stress of already busy teens.

Many teenagers start their day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their days are full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20% of teens get enough sleep, and 28% fall asleep in school at least once a week due to lack of sleep.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time a week, which isn't much out of 168 hours. She doesn't waste this time on social media or TV but focuses on volunteering. Olsen believes the stereotype is that teenagers only care about themselves and their immediate interests. However, she enjoys volunteering and making a positive impact in her school and community. 

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers might change, but they will still be proving it wrong and pushing the world forward. There will be a new generation of students making a big impact even before they finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the past few years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project with a twist: it's part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or metal piece enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to track temperature changes. Two GPS trackers were on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, was used to inflate the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy had driven seven hours to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For kids in this club, that's normal. Finally, it was time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chanted, and the balloon began to rise. Some of them ran and tracked its path with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was a quiet, shared sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at the clear sky, hard to believe it was just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I watched a boy climb into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor shot across the sky. As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, and the balloon expanded until it was almost the size of a house. Then it burst in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helped the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day, using the GPS trackers. Getting it back wasn’t easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box almost always lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a huge part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who noted they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey has been becoming more familiar with this landscape in a way you never normally would.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to get it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. Then they had to decide whether to drive or walk – it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. ‘It's important to remember that these students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What may seem wild and dangerous to some is just a way of life to others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but it was also a chance to discuss the effects of atmospheric waves and how they might work above mountain ridges. And it was another adventure story to share with others."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. Her interest started by accident. Her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a common phase for kids, which she hadn't gone through. She helped him with a science project and found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology. It amazed her, and she realized she wanted to pursue it. I asked her about the support she received, as Palaeontology wasn't a typical career choice for young people then. She recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. She was nervous, worried he might find her annoying, but he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

I asked Chloe about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV. She admits that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She finds the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies misleading, often showing them as either eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks. Films don't accurately show their daily work. Chloe explains that her job is varied, involving digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs, analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific journals. Communicating scientific findings to the public is also important to her, though not a daily task. She believes in addressing misunderstandings about science and enjoys reaching out to young people to spark their interest in the natural world and science.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, which aimed to accurately portray dinosaurs. She advised the makers, who were knowledgeable, and mostly checked that the dinosaurs shown lived in the same time period. The program attracted audiences of all ages because it depicted dinosaurs more realistically than movies like Jurassic Park.

I asked why dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain a research focus. Chloe thinks they appeal to our inner explorer. They draw our imagination to the unknown and the possibility of discovery. In a world that feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us there's still much to discover. Palaeontology, she says, is like time travel."
52,"I'm going to say this just once: when you're traveling by car with your family, even if you're six years old, you probably know you're not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking ""Are we there yet?"" The truth is, once you arrive, it's not ""there"" anymore; it's ""here."" So, if you think you might be ""there,"" you should ask ""Are we here yet?"" And no one wants to be ""there"" more than the parents who hear that question repeatedly on long car trips. Seriously, what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing expected of you? You can watch DVDs you haven't seen, listen to music, or do puzzles, while the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, there's mom or dad, acting as co-pilot, handing out juice boxes and cookies, adjusting the radio and temperature, making sure everything runs smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying—like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it's his other foot, then a hand, and soon he's in my space, and a fight starts. The driver and co-pilot reach back to separate us as the car speeds up and swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a while. The beautiful scenery continues to pass by. Soon after, I'm trying to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. But the car isn't going fast, and the window isn't open. Where's it coming from? My brother is in the next seat, quietly blowing air onto me. He's on his side, not touching me, so he's technically not doing anything wrong. Just breathing? What's the problem with that? The anger builds. Tim gets yelled at, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again—for now. Over the years, Dad has developed ways to handle us kids in the back seat. For example, when we ask ""Are we there yet?"" he often says, ""Yes. We're here. Get out of the car."" ""But Dad, we're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour."" ""Oh, well, maybe we're not there yet."" That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you're finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move as far away as they can from the kids who have annoyed them for hours. So remember: if mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is no. You're not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope customers will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: ""With so much technology, everyone is busy on their phones. We wanted to bring people together without screens. It's natural for us to communicate with each other.""

The games in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone involved until the end. This idea was improved in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. One example is Pandemic, a game by North American designer Matt Leacock, where players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He recalls, ""When I played it with friends, we felt scared and excited. Everyone felt good at the end, win or lose. I wanted to create something like that.""

Leacock's love for board games started in childhood. He often felt disappointed with games, so with his uncle's help, he would redesign them. Pandemic became very successful, and its sequel included more storytelling. Leacock says, ""It's like an electronic game where you develop characters, get new rules, and the world changes. It's an unfolding story.""

Interestingly, the growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games. Video games have made playing games more normal. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, says, ""Everyone with a smartphone plays at least one game. More people are open to playing games now.""

Video games once offered social interaction in arcades or with friends at home. But as multiplayer games moved online, players became physically separated. Some people who enjoyed video games started looking for games to play with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, games are something to share in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many false beginnings. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. Growing up, he only listened to a local radio station for middle-aged people, which influenced his musical taste. He didn't hear a contemporary song until he was 12. Around that time, he had to choose between playing tennis at a national level and music, as he spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. Although he was good at tennis, he realized it wasn't what he wanted to do for life because it was too much hard work.

At 17, Jamie left school to pursue a career in music. He formed a duo with a friend who was a decent guitarist but not as passionate about a music career. Jamie told his parents about his dream, explaining that he had been writing lyrics during economics lessons and playing the piano while others played outside. His father gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Jamie found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he switched to another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune didn't come. He felt that as an artist, he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, he was in the right place. Writing for others became his strength. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels rely on to help new artists start their careers. Sometimes, he explains to these artists that aiming for chart success is nothing to be ashamed of. He encourages them to write songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well.

Jamie speaks openly about wanting to write hit songs that reach number one, which is refreshing in the pop music world. He doesn't come across as arrogant; he simply knows he has a talent for writing hits. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goal. When he works in the studio, he aims to create music that is globally successful and the best of the next year. It's not just about being trendy; he wants to write classic modern pop songs."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity: he's very famous online but might be unknown to people who don't watch videos of bike stunts. He is a 'street trials cyclist,' which means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I met him for an interview at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, many local boys and even older people recognized him and called him a 'legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed with them. I was impressed by his bravery and creativity, even though I was skeptical at first. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and it's hard to believe he can succeed. But after he does, he seems uninterested in my praise and a bit down. Despite his online fame, Tony doesn't enjoy being a celebrity. He finds it hard to socialize and prefers doing things rather than talking about them. This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. He acknowledges that this technology allows him to make a living, but he feels uncomfortable with how much people focus on screens. However, he appreciates that he can earn money from what would have been just a hobby in the past. From my experience interviewing top athletes, I know that two key factors turn a passionate child into a top competitor: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. These are often more important than talent and help athletes persist despite failures. In risky sports, mental strength is crucial. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on relatively easy obstacles but kept trying until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he's reckless and takes unnecessary risks. Tony responds that these critics don't understand the sport and haven't ridden a trials bike. They don't know the technical details or that he gets expert advice to minimize risks. Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He believes it's important to be aware of dangers. Some people never feel scared, but Tony feels fear and finds a way to overcome it. He isn't addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning. Sometimes he rides around to get in the right mindset before a new stunt. He knows he must stay calm before jumping. If he fully commits, he's fine."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on several dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. Her latest challenge was walking on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, just a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found high-wire walking to be very different. ""The training was a shock,"" Helen said. ""I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could continue if I slipped. Every fall hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took her 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she said afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole using skis, a kite, and a bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about traveling around Canada in a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which gave him a serious fever. He was stuck in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days and had no money for hospital bills or to get back home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that lets us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but not at night, because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat. The work is tough. There are four of us, each working six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and note every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but often it's wet. It's so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We've only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a lab analyzing our results. It will be hard to be indoors, but it's necessary. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is crucial to ensure that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from the company I work for. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for our chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I test and taste the products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues to keep them happy. My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with, and it's great to have a private space to work in during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm in our food lab, and other times I'm traveling abroad to buy raw materials. This can be challenging because I have a young family. However, I love the variety and lack of routine in my job, although the chocolate itself is still my favorite part! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air above an amazed audience. During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, ""For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is crucial, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or only work for a short time each year. But the real issue is planning for the future because you can only perform while you're young, and then you need to think about other options."" The course also includes business planning. Many former students have started businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, that it's not a profession for making money! ""The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but a lot of fun!"""
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you've probably heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers, but that's not true—they often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! 

""What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes it's a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job!""

""Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There's often no sheet music to look at. I'll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, plus an orchestra. I was terrified because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always know which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it."""
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion. She created a successful company selling 'satchels,' which are traditional school bags. These bags are now sold in famous stores and are popular with celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She didn't just go with her first thought. When she chose satchels, not everyone agreed with her decision. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had no career experience but had a natural talent for business. The design inspiration came from children's storybooks. Although Julie wasn't familiar with fashion blogs, they played a key role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would mention them in their blogs. They did, and interest grew, along with the speed of production. Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity is spotted with a satchel. Instead of spending money on online ads, she uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now ensures she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices, where people love to work. There is now a new factory, and while the building is important, it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ""I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement stops, there's no point."" Fortunately, she started a new career. Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ""We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,"" she says. ""The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, bringing young people together as part of a larger group."" The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ""Some people doubt whether celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it for their own publicity, which can hide the charity's real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should."""
64,"Ana Ronson, a singer-songwriter, grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but music was always present at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. Ana first sang in front of an audience at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to gain confidence. After some time in the club, Ana sang with 50 other students at a concert and felt happy. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Although she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher didn't listen to her, so she wrote ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She posted the song online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled across Ireland to invite her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn't know the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. Joss assured her this wouldn't happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and the evening was amazing. Ana prefers writing songs about difficult times rather than happy ones because she feels there's more to express. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes fans enjoy her songs, her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes! 

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to visit. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about the trip details. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying. 

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people lived along that coast, and indeed, the only other living creatures we saw on the first morning were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. 

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop worrying about time. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like stress-free living! 

When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father. As a kid, I often went to watch his games. You might think this would make me love basketball, but it actually didn't. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually brought a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was almost a teenager and already two meters tall. My sports teacher noticed my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session but felt I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I agreed to play against another school. Having my parents watch made me nervous, but it turned out fine in the end.

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did well, even joining an adult team. At fifteen, I moved to a special sports academy in the USA. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't enjoy being far from my parents at first. Back home, I didn't have much time for friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly.

I turned professional at eighteen, three years after moving to the USA. I was taller than most professional players since I was fifteen, but I needed to gain weight for my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I found out that to get a license, I needed to know much more than I had learned. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent guide. Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. You need many other skills. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and you must react to changing situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know these reviews are important because good reviews attract more customers. That's why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy usually lead to very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I'm 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I wasn't sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. But in the end, there was nothing to worry about.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so gathering this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meal made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found this really fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants on foot into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn't have much space. That was our choice because Josie didn't want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn't include meat, which we both prefer to avoid. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I'm not sure she's being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she'll go back one day—I definitely will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people for their friends or homes; we have a variety of customers. Hotels and offices often want flowers for their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often colder and darker than I'd like, but that's normal for that time of the morning, so I don't mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I'd probably only pick pink ones because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what customers want can be different. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can't find what customers want.

I don't enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it's part of the job. Flowers aren't cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we check customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we create flower arrangements and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy figuring out how to make the nicest arrangements within a customer's budget. That's what you have to do when you're selling things, and I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It's close to where I live. However, a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which created the perfect atmosphere for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We’re happy just to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still a lot to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say they had a great experience, it’s wonderful. The website has been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs across the country. We’ve visited to see how things are done in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog too, because we know most people now go online for film information, rather than reading reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. However, nothing is as effective as word of mouth – people recommending us to their friends. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month we had a movie quiz, which everyone enjoyed."
71,"As a child, taking photographs was my favorite activity. When I turned 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I decided to start a special project: taking one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I uploaded my photos to a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and share my work with others. I was surprised to find that people liked my perspective and photos. I enjoyed capturing different subjects. Someone suggested that my project would be better if all the photos had a common theme. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were in black and white, which was different from other young photographers who used color. I sometimes doubted my project and almost quit several times. However, I trusted my instincts and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher, who told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some photos for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges announced I had won first prize; I was thrilled because my project was important to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough for a professional career. Now, I have my own photography studio and have never regretted my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking, which I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do various activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children's club for two hours a week as my first challenge. I wasn't sure about it because I had joined that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children's club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. After finishing the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had built strong relationships with the children. Now, I volunteer there for about four hours a week and always look forward to it.

Because of my experience at the children's club, I have decided that after finishing school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about this career before joining the club. In fact, I hadn't thought much about my future job at all. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have earned several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was so young that I hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I managed well. After that, I quickly developed a love for the sport and improved my skills. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored of snowboarding, but my love for competing and winning has grown stronger as I’ve gotten older, which motivates me to push myself harder. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes it works out well, like when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d try the jumps that got me this score until I actually started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. In the summer, I focus on training and my studies since there’s no snow. Although I train every day, it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends then. It helps me cope with not being able to do what I love and am really good at. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I also think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is possible if my active life allows time for a college degree. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had and didn't think about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I'm grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I found it easier than I expected, even though it looked complicated when I watched her. My friends thought it was boring, but I was excited about it. Mum showed me how to make beautiful things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewelry to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. I needed to know if they were good enough for the public, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewelry to take home as gifts. Soon, we got calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but it was just the two of us at a market stall! That's when I realized it could work, and it was time to create a website. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, ""Because of my dad's job, my family moved around a lot, so I got good at making new friends. I know what it's like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, starting at a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I'm an only child, I had to use my imagination for that."" Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she had won first prize in a short story competition on a young writers’ website. Because of this, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publisher, they were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was available in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia notes that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters in the story face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer says that even though Janine is young and the novel isn't very long, she has shown she is a better writer than some other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me on the street, but now it's OK. I’d like to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, spending time with friends gives me ideas to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. It all began when my dad was asked to be the castle's manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was happy because he thought he might not get such a great opportunity again, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were mainly thinking about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home across the water, and there was no school. However, once we moved, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels lively in summer because it attracts many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families living on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers as I had hoped. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island, which often requires a lot of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days with big waves, but the ferries don't run then! I've learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come to stay with me, I always tell them to hurry up! But we often get amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it's so foggy you can't see anything, and then a few hours later, it's sunny again – it's still incredible when that happens, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid damage. But then I remind myself it's been here for centuries – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I've always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby—birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local young birdwatchers' club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I've almost reached that because on family holidays abroad, I've had the chance to see birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I've been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I might see my 200th species. I wasn't too disappointed when it didn't happen, though, as I've learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it and commented that it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching to the school. I didn't feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I'd remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I'd prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I'm lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn't have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a decent player. My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee noticed I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. She was impressed and invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13. I improved a lot after that. Even so, some people doubted I’d become a star player, which made me a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want the other players to blame me if we lost. By pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach’s advice to me: you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few bad times, though, so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"In recent years, both in the UK and internationally, there has been a trend in higher education to involve students in research early in their studies. This shift acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists making big discoveries. Instead, research is a fundamental way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only in academics but also in the workplace because they help us think critically about the world and our work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can range from groundbreaking, complex studies by highly trained experts to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about various topics. Most students have already done some research, whether in school projects or everyday life, like planning a holiday or fixing things at home. In college, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, critically evaluating information, and forming your own ideas are key learning activities.

Some students might find this challenging, especially if they come from educational backgrounds where knowledge is seen as fixed and learned from authority figures like teachers and textbooks. In places like the UK, US, and much of Europe and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This approach can be intimidating, but critical thinking is crucial in research. We need to engage with others' research, think critically about it, and not just accept it as fact. It's important to test ideas, check if they are logical and supported by evidence, and not rely uncritically on information from others."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London gathered in coffee houses to discuss topics like chemistry and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso talked about modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities are creative hubs, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. 

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. It's known that city life is tiring, but new research shows it can also dull our thinking. One major issue is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for the brain. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they offer a mental break from city life.

This research is timely because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we are packed into crowded urban areas. This has significant effects on our mental and physical health and changes how we think. Walking down a busy street requires your brain to manage many things: distracted people, traffic, and the complex city layout. These tasks drain our mental energy because they force us to constantly focus and refocus our attention. 

Natural environments, on the other hand, don't demand as much mental effort. This concept is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and sought to integrate nature into urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer a break from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While people try various methods to boost cognitive performance, like energy drinks or office redesigns, simply walking in nature seems to be more effective.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain centers of intellectual life. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that challenge our attention also drive innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities fuels creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a hub of intellectual breakthroughs, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, thrive as creative centers. Less crowded cities might generate less innovation over time.

The challenge is to reduce the negative psychological effects of city life while keeping its benefits. After all, there are times when people crave the excitement of the city over the calm of nature."
81,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious to say that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to support this idea. However, I believe that the study of the mind shouldn't be limited to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in human thinking. Archaeology shows us that things like stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and shaping the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might also be part of the mind.

It's easy to see why people equate the mind with the brain. Most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their usual surroundings. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limitations of brain-scanning machines. But this approach often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny the importance of the brain in cognition, but I believe the mind is more than just the brain. We should explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world.

This is where my theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become extensions of our minds, like when we use clay to make numbers or a stone to create a tool. It also looks at how these interactions have changed over time and what they mean for our thinking. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of what objects do for the mind.

Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does this person's self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be continuous. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick plays an active role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence is adaptable and can change by incorporating new technologies.

I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, the 'stick' has taken many forms, from ancient stone tools to the internet. Its main role has been as a pathway, not a boundary. Through these 'sticks,' humans explore and understand the world, and also shape their future. This is different from how animals use tools. For humans, tools satisfy our curiosity and desire to learn. This unique human trait explains why we create things and how these things, in turn, shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world.

I want to include materiality in our understanding of cognition. MET offers a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from stone axes to smartphones, have defined and transformed us. Mind-changing technology might sound futuristic, but humans have been using it since we first evolved."
82,"Photography has greatly changed how we see the world and has had a big impact on civilization, especially in the United States. In the U.S., photography quickly became a part of culture at all levels, from practical and scientific uses to industrial and artistic ones. It also opened up new forms of entertainment. Many historians believe that photography is the U.S.'s greatest contribution to the visual arts, more so than any other art form. This shows how important photography has become in U.S. culture and thought, and to understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, because it was a mechanical process, it fit well with the growing interest in technology in the U.S., where change was seen as a normal part of life. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world feel smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with amazing immediacy. Second, the camera was the best tool for showing one's self-image in a country where personal and national identities were always being created and recreated. Third, the camera was important for creating and keeping family memories, even if they were somewhat idealized. Lastly, the realistic nature of photographs matched the U.S. artists' focus on realism and everyday life. Every photograph draws attention to something the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""This, you should see!"" Because photographs are made by machines, they are seen as records of events, people, or things, giving them a sense of objectivity. However, since they are taken by individuals, they also reflect a personal point of view.

People often think they understand a photograph because they recognize the subject, which is why photography is sometimes called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of photographs is more complex. No image is shown to us without some context that affects how we understand it, like a newspaper caption or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and how it was first seen. The same photograph can have different meanings in different contexts.

For a long time, the camera's role in art was not widely acknowledged, but now it is very important for contemporary artists. Since the time of U.S. artist Andy Warhol, who used photographs in his paintings and silk screens, artists have been using photographs in many ways. In short, photography has become an essential part of art, working alongside painting to shape our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea of what this means. However, even though we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains a complex concept. James, like most psychologists, was mainly interested in human psychology. He believed it included basic elements: thoughts and feelings, a physical world in time and space, and a way to understand these things. This understanding is personal and private, coming from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and may not always align with scientific facts. 

We often act as amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex psychological topics, like whether brainwashing works, or when we explain why people behave in certain ways, such as feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems arise when people have different understandings. Formal psychology tries to find methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in a situation. Psychologists help us distinguish between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and scientific facts. 

Psychology, as defined by James, is about the mind or brain. Although psychologists study the brain, they don't fully understand how it influences our hopes, fears, and behaviors. It's hard to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about what's happening inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings aren't directly observable like an engine. We can only infer them from behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, using clues from careful observation and analysis. 

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control or modify processes. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life. Psychological research has improved teaching methods, machine safety, and emotional well-being by helping people communicate better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to study the mind. While introspection is still considered, it has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of brain activity. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays products that were taken off the market because almost no one wanted to buy them. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople who created it. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business. You might think that companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but many executives visit the museum because they haven't done so. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, began collecting samples of new products in the 1960s, not specifically failures. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection naturally included many unsuccessful ones.

Today's culture of optimism might explain why these failed products exist. Each product likely went through meetings where no one realized it was doomed. Even if they did, marketers might have invested more money to force some sales and save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and people involved often avoid discussing it. This focus on optimism is common in the growing self-help industry, where ""positive visualization"" is popular. The idea is that imagining success makes it more likely to happen. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that our brains might be wired to be overly optimistic, which can help us survive. Her research shows that well-balanced people often have an overly positive view of their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression.

However, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that ""positive fantasies about the future"" can reduce motivation. People who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less. Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a ""fixed theory"" mindset think ability is innate, so failure is a sign they aren't good enough. For example, a sports star who believes he is a ""natural"" might not practice enough to reach his potential. In contrast, people with an ""incremental theory"" mindset see failure as a chance to grow. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles grow by being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."
85,"Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? We might think we know, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists are exploring what helps players perform their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. On the other hand, financial interests question if home advantage should matter at all, as players are paid well and should perform well anywhere.

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their support is crucial for the team. Fans often think their cheering leads to goals, but they forget the times when their noise didn't result in success. However, one fan belief is supported by science: home fans influence referees. In an experiment, referees who heard crowd noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team compared to those who watched in silence. This suggests referees avoid making decisions that would anger the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England's Football League won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in luxury, and stadiums are more similar. Despite these changes, home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the strongest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because basketball relies more on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home.

Another factor could be players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This might relate to a natural urge to defend home territory. In the recent Rugby World Cup, underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is valued by dedicated athletes and their coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with claims for other golfers of that time. Its meaning is also not straightforward. Player didn't mean 'lucky' literally; he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ But how much better can one get? This question is central to the nature-nurture debate in sports: is talent something you're born with, or can it be developed? 

The debate isn't balanced; nurture, or practice, has been seen as more important. This idea is largely due to psychologist Anders Ericsson, who proposed that becoming an expert in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice. This theory inspired Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Outliers"" and others like ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" These books suggest that practice is the key to success, and that 10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert. 

However, in his book, Epstein argues that this isn't always true. He points out a flaw in studies about excellence: they often only look at successful people. Science is better at explaining why an elite athlete is successful after the fact. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others don't, considering factors like environment, support, opportunity, and determination. His research takes him around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to the Arctic. 

In Alaska, Epstein learns that in the world's toughest sled dog race, the husky dogs' drive and desire are crucial, suggesting a link between genes and traits we think are voluntary. This challenges the idea that commitment and determination are just choices. What if, as with the huskies, an individual's drive also has a genetic component? 

Epstein highlights the complexity of the topic. He distinguishes between 'hardware' (nature) and 'software' (nurture) and agrees that in elite athletes, both are necessary. He doesn't dismiss the importance of training or environment, suggesting that if Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. But Epstein also looks at cases where genetics are so important that they can't be ignored. He examines race and gender, asking: ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports?’ Sometimes the most obvious questions are the best ones."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature. This idea matches other discussions about modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could spend more time outside. People over 40 often remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they played outside freely, which they believe was healthier than the protected lives of today's children. However, they don't often realize that they are the ones who have created these protective environments for their kids, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book includes strong arguments about the fear of outdoor dangers and how it benefits the toy and gadget industry, which sells products to keep children entertained indoors. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. While some of these rules might be exaggerated, Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly and passionately. She also discusses childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules. Although her arguments are appealing, Griffiths sometimes takes them too far and ignores important counter-arguments. For example, she compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems extreme.

Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children, often seeing them in an idealized way. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks, arguing that they need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children may want the adventurous life she describes. Some children are naturally cautious and prefer staying at home. Perhaps the real issue is forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill doesn't come from my education. Most life problems can't be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those with more to learn play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how mammals, including humans, have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, and moral lives can't be taught in school. These skills are learned through play and include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is crucial for economic success. We don't need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate obstacles, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We can't teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on imposed questions rather than children's own questions. Even more important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care about them, and cooperate. Children are naturally driven to play with others, and this play helps them learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit if they want. This makes play the most democratic activity. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and pressure for high grades has grown. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults present have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene rather than let children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, warnings from experts, less cohesive neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children don't need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They need to follow their natural drive to play and explore to become strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow direct contact with potential employers, similar to standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, this access also increases the chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to use her contacts to get a job. The executive was offended by this request and not only rejected it but also sent a harsh, sarcastic reply that went viral. People who saw the note online were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone, though not the message. This incident highlights the risks of using social media for job hunting without knowing how to do it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. 

Ironically, social media like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of twentysomethings for years. For my generation, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers, a place to impress and experiment. It was often based on fantasy, where you could have long conversations online and then ignore the person at school. You could change your image overnight with the right pictures or songs on Facebook. But when it comes to professional networking, our experience with social media can be a disadvantage. Using social media professionally is very different, and some young people don't see the difference. We first gained our online presence by being bold and confident, which might explain why some still think this is a good approach. Just because many people liked your Facebook posts doesn't mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you're worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn't apply now, and we must meet employers' standards to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too familiar and seem arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of our generation as entitled. In reality, many of us are desperate to find jobs, which is why we turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can harm the job prospects of young people who actually have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees. So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, generic emails, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it requires careful handling to avoid closing doors."
90,"Text: Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre reports that only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people predict that printed newspapers will disappear in the next 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were outdated, but both have survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived despite TV, and cinema has competed with videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This was partly because it only became possible and affordable to produce news for a large audience in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railway, and telegraph. Another reason was the new idea that everything is constantly changing and we need regular updates, which was not common in medieval times. Today, we expect change. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life was seen as cyclical, with important truths repeating. Journalism as a profession only really started in the 19th century, and even then, there was no clear reason why people needed regular news. Regular newspaper publication can be limiting. Online news allows readers to check updates based on their interests and the importance of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms let us personalize news. When big stories happen, online news can provide minute-by-minute updates. Mistakes and misunderstandings can be quickly corrected. There are no space limits, so stories can be detailed, and full documents can be accessed. This is very different from traditional newspapers. However, many online news providers focus on being first with the news and generating reader comments, which can create confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. In some ways, we are returning to that. Newspapers have not always been great at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction, or they might find a way to help us understand our complex world."
91,"If humans were truly comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many nocturnal animals do. However, we are creatures of the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a fundamental part of our genetics, even if we don't often think of ourselves as daytime beings, just like we don't always think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This explains why we have changed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control over the night is similar to building a dam on a river. While it has benefits, it also causes problems known as light pollution, which scientists are just beginning to study. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, where artificial light shines into the sky instead of being directed downwards where it is needed. This poorly designed lighting brightens the night, changing the natural light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would have been meaningless. Imagine approaching London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's largest city. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and public gaslights wouldn't appear for another seven years. From a few miles away, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We've illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that's not true. Among mammals alone, many species are nocturnal. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. This effect is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds are 'captured' by searchlights on land or gas flares on marine oil platforms, flying around them until they fall. Birds migrating at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, with young birds on their first journey being most affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours when exposed to artificial light. It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need an unobstructed view of the night sky for our jobs, but like most creatures, we do need darkness. Ignoring the need for darkness is pointless. It is as important for our health as light; changing our internal clock can cause health problems. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping in our lives reflects the natural cycle of light on Earth. These rhythms are so essential to us that disturbing them is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs near a brightly lit highway. Living in the bright light we created, we have disconnected from our evolutionary and cultural heritage—the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us lose sight of our true place in the universe, forgetting our scale, which is best understood against the backdrop of a deep night with the Milky Way—the edge of our galaxy—arching overhead."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently announced that his company will stop tracking employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder said the idea came from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by someone from his media team. Ignoring the way the announcement was made, which might be an attempt to make the policy seem more friendly, we should ask: is this idea practical?

The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn't harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads and can judge if their absence would be a problem. However, this is still a vague idea.

The founder of the multinational company said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team are up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much you prepare before a holiday, there is always a lot of work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works; work piles up while you're away. Following these guidelines might make employees not take leave at all or feel guilty about it. This guilt can lead to stress, and if employees don't take enough leave, it could reduce productivity over time.

There could also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. This pressure already affects decisions like when to start and end the workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If the security of having a set amount of leave is removed, people might feel they can't take the leave they need because they don't want to seem lazy. They wouldn't have their legal right to rely on anymore. This policy might make employees feel stuck, unable to take their leave, or they might just stick to their legal rights, making the policy pointless.

Modern technology lets us receive work messages anytime, anywhere, blurring the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company couldn't track work hours accurately, why use an outdated standard for time off? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being monitored, leading them to self-monitor, which could be harmful.

Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest and leisure are important for their mental and physical health. The benefits like increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can happen without affecting worker well-being. I am doubtful that allowing employees to ""take as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field review a scientific paper before it is published. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research by preventing flawed papers from being published. This process can delay publication by up to a year, raising the question of whether this delay is worth it to ensure trust in scientific literature. The answer is both yes and no, as the system of scientific publishing is changing.

I still believe in some form of peer review before formal publication, but things are shifting. Preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review, are becoming more common. They allow for quick sharing of new research so others can read, critique, and build on it. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which can lead to authors cutting corners and reviewers focusing more on whether a paper is suitable for a journal rather than its quality.

These issues are known, but few are willing to change the current system. However, preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a major change from the norm. Although preprints have been around for twenty years, they are not widely used due to misconceptions that journals won't accept papers already shared as preprints and fears of spreading poor-quality science. However, preprints are open to critique by a global community, which can help maintain quality.

Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper critiqued another published paper, which is difficult to do in traditional journals due to anonymous peer review. By using a preprint, the original authors could respond openly, allowing for a transparent discussion. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments remain available, ensuring the work is not wasted.

Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions that were once private. They can also be a place to share negative results, which are often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Papers on preprint archives are read and cited more, showing the effectiveness of this method. By embracing the internet's openness and the collaborative spirit of science, preprints can help focus attention on the research itself, rather than where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say it's like 'a painting in words.' These answers don't usually satisfy anyone. So, I tried a different approach. I asked them to pick an object and write two paragraphs: one describing it like a scientist, and another from the object's perspective, titled 'Poem.' One student wrote: 

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I'm a device that helps people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. 

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and sparked a lot of discussion. 

When I was in school, poetry often seemed confusing. I thought of poems as puzzles that blocked true understanding and emotion. After school, many people lose interest in poetry. Sometimes, you come across a poem, and it stands out because it's not like regular prose. It challenges you to read it, but often leaves you feeling let down or confused. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we expect from poems? Aren't they supposed to hold deep feelings, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp wit? The answer might seem to be yes. But for emotions, we turn to movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels offer escape, paintings please the eye, and music combines lyrics, instruments, and melody in a way nothing else can. 

However, poems have a unique quality: ambiguity. Everyday life is full of it, unlike straightforward reading. But this doesn't fully explain what a poem is. If you search online for 'poem,' it leads you to 'poetry': 'a form of literary art using the beauty and rhythm of language.' This is academic language, but it misses the word's origin. 'Poem' comes from the Greek 'poí?ma,' meaning 'a thing made,' and a poet is 'a maker of things.' So, if a poem is a made thing, what kind of thing is it? 

Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals—untameable and unpredictable—or to machines—precise and engineered. But these comparisons don't hold up under scrutiny. The value in comparing poems lies in the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or animals. It helps us rethink familiar ideas and see ordinary things differently. 

Thinking of a poem as a mental object isn't hard, especially when we consider how song lyrics stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. But aren't words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Imagine a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, standing out. A poem can impact us like nothing else, even though it's just ink on paper like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem—space that could be used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it doesn't become a commodity. Publishers promote poetry collections, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not for the market; it's for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been wiser to spend it on something practical for the house. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has brought me joy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of free hours and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, intricately designed loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. ""Marion!"" I shouted, ""I've got something for you."" She came into the room and stopped when she saw it. ""What is it?"" she asked. I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been burgled, but I was anxious, so I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says you must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask me, ""Now that you've found something so amazing, are you going to stop detecting?"" But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing—there's always the chance of catching an even bigger fish tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When friends tell me about their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian sheets. Better sleep is a great benefit of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. Even with noisy birds nearby, I slept deeply and had vivid dreams. Being away from home and free from alarms and responsibilities, sleep came easily. But I think there's more to it than just relaxing. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, and smells. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. Sleep helps us process all this new information, which is why it feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with each place we visit. People often worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to this new sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, everyone slowly stopped talking and moved to hammocks and sofas to nap. I realized why there were so many pillows around. I joined them and experienced the local custom of the siesta, sharing a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is memorable because it's different from my usual routine. I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that come with sleeping in a new place. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity of all. Maybe I should stop feeling guilty and tell my friends that travel sleep is an important part of the experience too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said diplomatically to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking a bit like a bulldog. ""But it's so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black mini top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she decided, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about Jen's friend, Tattie, whom they knew nothing about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia's husband Jeff had questioned the name. ""Tattie,"" he said, ""What sort of name is that?"" Mia explained it was short for Tatiana and thought it was nice. Jeff, who disliked anything pretentious, disagreed. He also didn't like Mia's tendency to be overly polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and might have even joked that a dustbin lid would suit her better. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you're too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. Her commute was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew there was, as her friends often complained about finding the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. From the start, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia's Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where they could try on many hats in a relaxed setting. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure everything matched. Recently, she expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It's a long journey from London to Atlanta, and Lawrence Okoye is reflecting on his incredible sports career. He is confident, but even he is surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Despite never playing American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen by a top USA team. In Atlanta, he is still learning the details of his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be selected for a top American sports team is surprising. But Lawrence is used to overcoming doubts. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but delayed it to focus on discus, after playing rugby. In just 20 months, he became the world's fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, aiming for the world championships. He admits that American football was always in the back of his mind, but it was only when he arrived in the USA that he decided to try it. At school in London, he had thought about it, but it seemed unrealistic then. Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ""Pretty much,"" he says simply. He applied online. Was he nervous about competing with experienced American football players? ""No,"" he says. ""I don't get nervous for many things."" He doesn't talk much, but he is confident in his abilities. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ""I was very pleased to hear that,"" he says, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is also cautious. He has no experience in American football. How can he make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have all the qualities needed. It's just about how hard I work,"" he replies. Will he stay calm while waiting to hear if he's selected? ""I will be. There's no pressure on me. Many people say I'll definitely be selected, but I'm not too worried."" This calmness might come from his disappointing Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved past this and is happy he made it to the final with an impressive last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he says. ""The final didn't go as I wanted, but that's part of sport. I can always return to it."" After his Olympic setback, some thought he was affected by the big occasion. Lawrence doesn't comment on this. An NFL player's minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his great physical abilities, wouldn't it be better to focus on one sport? ""I understand why someone would say that,"" he responds. ""I'm trying to achieve something I've dreamed about since I was a schoolkid. If it doesn't work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I've made has been well thought out."""
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, winter hadn't started in Siberia yet. There was no sign of human life, just an endless view of mountains, streams, and forests. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow traveling to remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I told him I believed there was a road, though not many people used it anymore. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend named Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and said ""Holodna"" (cold) while pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at discounted prices. I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman's over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats, some taking notes without much energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was fulfilling. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: cycling around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong those who doubted him. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to participate. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed I was healthy, and the second required me to empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned I needed to stay oriented by looking at the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I was also told to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. 

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was instructed not to touch anything. As we taxied down the runway, I tried not to touch the steering pedals or any switches. My mind was made up: I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense and relax at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea. This was not comforting as we started accelerating. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we quickly turned right. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the plane's roof. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for a small gap between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even started the acrobatics yet.

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too—it was that responsive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience during races. To prove the point, Dario ate sandwiches right after we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night I dreamed of doing loops over and over."
101,"Doug Allan is a cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. If you've ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. He says his ideal temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, and it taught him how to survive in cold environments. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. 'I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.' He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. 'I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. There were people who specialized in coral, elephants, chimpanzees. I just became the cold guy. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.' The camera and communication technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. 'It is certainly easier to film today. Back then, if you filmed something, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can film a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You filmed less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.' 'My value is my field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.' Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy task. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off-limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is harsh and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very difficult. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. 'We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting extra supplies. This meant he had to swim in freezing waters and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more challenging expedition. Explorers are confident and determined people, and Pen is no exception. This time, however, the stakes are higher. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer journey to the North Pole to measure the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be crucial for scientists. This will provide the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. 

Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She toughened him up by sending him out into the Scottish mountains during blizzards with minimal clothing. His father also loved icy adventures, and Pen developed exceptional physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman who says he has a ""spine of steel"" and shares his love for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he's at home, saying, ""He's in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he's somewhere in the Arctic."" For fun, Mary once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horseback compete against runners. Mary and her horse finished an hour ahead of Pen. 

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ""It's much harder to be away from them this time,"" he admits. ""They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in how I said goodbye. I told my son, 'You're the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.' He took it seriously, but it was too much pressure for him. It was well-intentioned but unfair."" Because of this, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while in the Arctic. ""If you call them, you remind them how far away you are."" He is spending his last days before leaving preparing his equipment carefully. ""Out on the ice, you can't fix things or do anything complicated,"" he says. Joining him will be Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support team of six flying in supplies. 

Being part of a team is more stressful for someone like Pen, and he has other concerns too. ""I'm turning 47 on Thursday. I've done less training than I would like."" Why? ""Organizational tasks always seem more urgent. So I'm almost afraid of what I'm going to ask of myself."" Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the quest for knowledge that inspired past explorers. ""Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,"" he admits, ""and not very useful to anyone outside the polar adventure community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we're trying to engage as many people as possible in what's happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,"" he says. ""Our skills, which seemed odd and unnecessary, are now very relevant. Suddenly, we're useful to society again."""
103,"I took a year off and wondered what to do next. Being an Olympian is amazing, and I had opportunities to write, work on TV, and speak at schools and businesses. While these activities were great, I missed having a competitive challenge. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to compete in the Olympics again, so I started running marathons and doing triathlons. But there was still Ben Fogle's invitation in my mind: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed the feeling of the boat gliding through the water, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but no one was interested. I knew if I joined, I would want to win, and I wasn't sure if Ben was the best partner for that. However, the idea of being an underdog with no pressure was appealing. 

I contacted Ben, who was already planning to do the race and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the remaining costs, which were high, with the boat and equipment alone costing £70,000. We thought we had a good chance, but it would require effort to secure everything. Besides the race expenses, I also had to consider the loss of income from being away. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Joining the race meant I would have something new to talk about: rowing across the Atlantic.

Planning this adventure taught me to appreciate the simpler life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but straightforward, with set training programs and support from doctors and dieticians. I was worried about how people would react to me racing with a TV presenter, thinking it might seem like I just wanted to be on TV. But during our preparations, those concerns faded. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about mental strength than just rowing skills. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. However, he couldn't row well. I was surprised by his lack of natural rowing ability, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have expected his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of the cold, open landscapes of the Arctic, maybe as a reaction to the noisy and crowded life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to over 100. Recently, they took over a second property called the 'wilderness farm', which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They said I could join the team for three months if I understood what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away.

November 6, London On my flight, I try to memorize the names of over 100 huskies, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the list down and look out the window instead. People say that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of blooming flowers and leaves. But I feel like I’m seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus ride north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests of thin conifers covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrive at the farm after dark and am immediately given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes a loud noise as I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, harnessing the huskies to sleds. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, eager to start. I can barely introduce myself, and the others are too busy to talk. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and we take off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I face tough questions about what I can contribute. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m unsure. Am I? More questions reveal that I’m not very useful: I’ve never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never used an axe. 'Do you have a driving licence?’ someone finally asks. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding are easy to learn: lean into corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But everything else is complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs are hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water freezes solid while you watch, so we make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is full of instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I feel triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after a training accident where she ran into a bike. Radcliffe says the achievement didn't really sink in at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits.

During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep up the fast pace, fearing she might drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, though he admitted that anyone who didn't know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast but still managed to sprint the last distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run quicker than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would come close to that time soon, but Radcliffe thought, ""I'm going to come back and do it next year."" Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

After the race, people wondered how an athlete with such an awkward style could beat the graceful East African runners. Hartmann had spent weeks with Radcliffe, giving her daily sessions to help with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could take that level of pain. She would wear me down because I had to go so deep into her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no greeting or offer of tea. Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour session. She pushed Hartmann to give his best, which made her so good. During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.

Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ""Not really. I trained really hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought it might happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves."" What does she mean? ""That mental way of never easing up, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me to it because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always: 'keep pushing as hard as you can.'""

Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run as fast again. However, she left a lasting legacy, inspiring many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cookery show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" was released, I was unsure how viewers and the press would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our show added something new to this movement, but I was still worried. Would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode with mixed feelings of joy and fear. I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other exciting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often very physical, involving travel with passports and suitcases. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet extraordinary artisans, like a man dedicated to making the best golden pasta. These people have spent years pursuing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is subjective. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorites were left out. I imagined people asking, ""Where's steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?"" However, after a long meeting, the TV team and I created a list that had something for everyone. This confirmed my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on personal emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book's title, I never claimed the recipes were 'definitive.' But I thought that by using my technical skills and scientific knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying ideas and refining them until they are unique. The TV series allowed me to explore foods, people, and places I had never encountered in any restaurant. I was excited about this, as well as exploring memory and nostalgia in food, because that's how I started in this business. Searching for the best ingredients took me around the world. Some of my adventures included being taken to a canning factory that processed the wrong type of tomato and visiting a dairy farm with standards so low we had to stop filming. Refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine, and nearly burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a few hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and looked under the hood. He stood there for a while, looking at the engine with his hands in his pockets, pretending to know what he was doing. Finally, he admitted, ""Actually, I have no idea what I'm doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried and said, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was vast, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was always safest to be on her side. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass and asked me to tell a story. Bea lay next to her, and I started telling them about how I heard two birds talking the day before we left London. I told them about the things the birds discussed, like breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and a fight over a worm. Bea said, ""That's silly, no one understands bird language."" My eyes stung, and I said, ""I do,"" but I didn't sound convincing. ""Liar,"" she said, and I felt embarrassed. I wondered how I could be lying if I remembered everything. I asked Mum, but she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped push the van to a hotel. Bea didn't want to get out, but the boys didn't mind and waved at her through the window. We followed John into a café near where the van was parked. ""It's a hotel,"" John whispered, ""It might be expensive."" Mum said, ""We'll just have some tea,"" and we sat on the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot and said, ""It's like syrup."" We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the engine. ""It's a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn't moving. ""I'll have to get us towed into Marrakech,"" John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John driving it. Bea didn't want to move at first, so John carried her into the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we would get home since our van needed to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike Lucy, they were not competing. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, but Lucy didn't catch her name clearly over the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing, their recent travels, and their future plans. 

Lucy mentioned, ""I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,"" which sounded impressive. However, she didn't really want to go to the Tanglewood festival, just like she hadn't wanted to do many of the activities that filled her schedule. These included concerts and competitions that took her around the world, causing her to miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad celebrated by buying her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant, and her little brother Gus dreamed of attending the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The thing was, Lucy hadn't applied herself; her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. ""I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,"" her mom had said. Lucy thought it was more like her mom didn't want to give her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn't even think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward, surprised. ""Tanglewood?"" he asked. ""Yeah,"" Lucy replied. ""How old are you?"" ""Fifteen."" He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy hadn't meant to show off. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was just fitting in or bragging. ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying..."" Liesel/Louisa excused herself, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, ""Have you ever been to Japan?"" He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were rebel music nerds. ""Once. When I was, like, eight,"" Lucy replied. He was about to say something when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,"" he said, taking her arm and leading her away. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition."" ""They're not the competition,"" Lucy said. ""Everyone is the competition,"" her grandfather replied.

He took her around the room, introducing her to people he thought were important. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, only catching about half of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ""You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" Lucy liked that part—being somebody. Even if it meant some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn't earn her any special respect from the kids she used to go to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro perfectly. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"""It's not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,"" said Dad. He's hard to argue with, so I decided to see what experts say about it. It's quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important digital skills. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a key part of modern childhood. Teenagers don't just use media for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do; they live in it. It's not about whether it's good or bad, but how you use it.

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it's like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where today's parents used to share jokes and gossip. It helps teenagers develop their identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and interact with peers.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says adolescence is a time to ask, ""Who am I?"" Social networking can help you find your self-identity by sharing your favorite music or sports and seeing different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are less self-centered than those who don't use social media. He also says that social media can be helpful if you're shy, as online communication can be more comfortable than face-to-face interactions.

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with specific interests connect with others who share those interests. For example, if you're one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel isolated. But finding a social networking group with similar interests can make you feel more connected.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online and create their own content are really using social networks well. She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force, with teenagers making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity by allowing photographers to network, learn, and share images. This can improve employability and be beneficial in the workplace. Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness, so understanding how it works is important. For example, if you create a product and have 1,000 friends on social networks, they could be potential customers. Linking these networks can build your customer base.

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they enter the workforce, agrees Matthews. Many sites offer opportunities to collaborate and share content, which is a valuable 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age."""
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long road trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first idea that comes to mind. However, my parents had a different plan for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to organize what many teenagers would consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" my parents kept saying before the trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There must be good reasons for that!""

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home for smaller accommodations over the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under some of the darkest, star-filled skies in the country, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way!

The next day, we were up at dawn and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what was to come later in our journey. As we climbed to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dodging construction traffic became normal. We laughed as we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument.

We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common, and our own close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its creaky floors and no internet or cell phone service, couldn't dampen our spirits. In exchange, I got to see some of the most beautiful views ever.

After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic foreign place to find something amazing. It was bittersweet to be home again, but at least I hadn't fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our crazy journey to look through and remember. For me, the best memories were the unplanned, spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost, a sixteen-year-old girl, was moving to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was splitting up for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, was going with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and would live under the care of the college Head. She was happy to have the best room at the college, which included a kitchen and study area, plus free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still keep an eye on Amy.

Rose was going to her grandmother's house. She only had vague holiday memories of Daisy and had never met her grandfather. Although Rose's parents were not thrilled about the idea, Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was excited to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn't fully understand why her parents had issues with Daisy, but there had been a disagreement in the past, leading to summers spent away from her. Rose's last memory of Daisy was when she was ten, and it was a happy one.

Dahlia mentioned that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and good at bringing people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon. This made Rose smile because Daisy was not a typical frail grandmother. She seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was mature and knew about healthy living. She wanted independence, like playing loud music, inviting friends over, or going out without always asking for permission. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood this. Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen phone for emergencies, which made Rose very happy. They agreed to trust each other: Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were any issues, they would discuss them.

Rose was not a rebellious child. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her case. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, make new friends, and basically start over. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this would be her last move as she was starting her final two years of school. For Rose, it was a new chapter in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book was a big achievement because it seemed challenging, and she wasn't sure what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to give it a try. Now, the novel she started back then is about to be published. She recently told her former teacher, who was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte couldn't understand why she should wait to do something she might be good at.

It's a winter afternoon at Charlotte's publisher's office. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager there. The book is impressive: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support, but she doesn't. Charlotte is confident, intelligent, and steady, without being overconfident.

Charlotte admits she is young and doesn't have all the answers. When I ask her about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don't have many life lessons to share,"" she laughs. ""I don't think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I'm not particularly wise either. I just wanted to explore the theme of taking responsibility.""

She has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in books. She believes there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who lacks social skills. Reading about these types frustrated her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who aren't inadequate in some way. Some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers can't know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.""

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep psychological and life issues. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I was capable of it."" However, she praises a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It says if the reader can guess what's going to happen, the suspense is probably gone.""

Some might think Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get published. Her father's connection in publishing did help her book get read initially. She admits she's lucky because getting a first novel read is tough, no matter the author's age. ""Every aspiring writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show he knew what he was doing, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump, hit the ramp fast, and flew into the air with his arms flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how, and I feared being laughed at if I tried to join the skateboarders with their baggy trousers and special language. Then my parents decided on a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students would jump, try new tricks, and land in foam pits – not a realistic start for what awaited us on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan assured us. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again for the landing. Land in the zone and you keep moving forward, reducing impact. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which is painful. That’s why speed is important. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain and race towards the jump. My legs would almost go backward as I neared the launch point, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was addictive. Some drills copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body is doing as you spin in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last. On the final run of the day, I kept my speed as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and your nails dig into the safety harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There's a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this experience, just like millions of others who visit theme parks every year. 

It's interesting that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are such a big industry. To create the excitement and escape that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's actually very challenging. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe. They also need to add new features to keep people coming back. 

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most of the techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited by the track designs from specialist manufacturers.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it's about quickly switching between different forces so people feel thrilled but safe. It's a fine line between excitement and discomfort.

To create an amazing ride, teams must build a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or the most twists. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that designers need to love thrills to understand what passengers want and to test rides before they open to the public.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add something extra, like a nice paint job on an old coaster, but the physical ride experience will remain the most important part for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating pieces for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances occasionally. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. She explains, ""Dancing again reminds me of what it's like to be in the studio, taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it's like to rehearse all day."" As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching and working with young students. ""New dancers are often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want success but don't fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This means they accept even harsh criticism. They might challenge me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her work. ""There might be music I'm not fond of, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don't respond well to a certain composer's music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can't just choose a new piece. Ideally, I'd like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces, which would help when rehearsals get tough. But now, I'm always working on big productions where the music is already set by the composer and can't be changed.""

Miranda doesn't want to be tied to one institution. ""I think it's important to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that each theatre and school I work with has different methods and styles. So I need to adapt my work each time, instead of doing the same thing everywhere. This helps me avoid becoming too fixed in my ways.""

We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ""There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,"" says Miranda. ""This one tries to show what life in a dance company is really like. There was a scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I recognized that. She knows she's not getting it right but can't make her body do what's needed. It's hard to watch but not staged for the cameras. The public often underestimates the work and dedication involved in ballet.""

I'm curious about what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ""It's when everything the company has invested in – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – all come together. Perfection might be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I've been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props is distracting. That's disappointing.""

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I ask how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ""People want to label you, and I don't understand that. There's also a trend to focus on a narrow area of expertise. I don't follow that, though maybe one day I'll be known for one thing. For now, I want to broaden my horizons."""
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there's so much to experience outside? That conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of an old sofa, which became the main feature of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to secure it over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even spending one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to continue. I've been on many walking trips in recent years, but this was completely different. It was the longest distance I've ever walked, and it was on main roads, so I could stop at roadside cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino, instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I often had to tell people, ""No, I'm not doing it for charity, and I'm not training for a marathon."" When someone at work asks about my weekend, I'd rather talk about dragging a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea. At the Greek port, the man seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although he still looked puzzled, he let me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group—not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, though, and was happy when I finally did it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and enjoyment of completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant isn't easy, but it's a great job for someone young like me. Since I started, I've traveled all over, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have lots of free time, and life is never dull. As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad and often flew alone. I felt lonely, so I would ask flight attendants if I could help serve meals, and some let me. This memory stayed with me when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new path. At the interview, there were many young people, and lots of them were accepted. They were often well-qualified and changing careers, like me. I practiced what to say before the interview, focusing on my strengths and work experience, not just my love for travel, and I got the job! I recommend this job to anyone because there are many benefits, but free flights aren't the main one. Airline staff work very hard, and there's a saying: ""no-one's finished till everyone's finished."" It's like a big family; even if we don't see each other often, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to bring work home. And if I deal with difficult passengers, which doesn't happen often, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won't see them again."
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love watching the children succeed at things they didn't think they could do. Most of them already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is new for many. Some kids feel nervous, but with some encouragement, they try it and eventually reach the top. This makes them feel really good. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home. Surprisingly, it's not the youngest ones who feel this way the most, but those aged ten to thirteen. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, if they ask again after dinner, we say it's a bit late and suggest they call the next day. Most kids are fine after a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they thank us for the great time they had.

It's not just the children who feel lonely; sometimes parents call a lot to check on their child, which isn't really necessary. Often, the child is busy playing games or doing activities, so we ask the parents to call back later. We also often see a certain type of child who comes dressed in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but they soon understand why it's necessary."
120,"""Rock the Planet"" is a musical show where the actors also need to be excellent musicians. It started in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the 'Best Musical' award four times. However, using an all-British cast was challenging because the UK has stricter rules on how many shows young actors can perform each week compared to the USA. This meant they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have already won their first 'Best Musical' award. The London theatre is larger than the one in the USA, but it has been full every night, with people eager to hear the songs that were first popular in America.

I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ""It's amazing that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar."" He explained how busy the young actors are, saying, ""We have regular school lessons at the theatre every day. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends."" When asked about his friends' opinions on the show, he said, ""My whole class came to see it! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it's expensive for them.""

When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found an extra one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called ""Days,"" which I didn't know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie's talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was relieved the show's director wasn't there to hear my mistakes!

Although the young actors were already musicians and some played several instruments, none had been in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together because they were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year and is definitely worth seeing."
