1,C2,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just telling people, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you are also letting everyone know you are not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This made people more aware that there could be negative sides to sharing too much online. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering possibilities like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize that the online world is crowded and risky, and we can get lost. This might sound depressing, but don't lose hope. There is a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the internet and faced many challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame, all before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While his work was very open, it also had a certain beauty that some might call art. One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem of sharing too much online remains. Sharing online is great, but if you think it will make people like you more, you might be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to all the vice presidents at her company, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that while the internet lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.
At first, the film seemed harmless. It showed scientists saying that new discoveries are revealing the universe to be stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of a water molecule could be changed by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing, but many scientists do not. They want solid proof that thoughts can affect water, and pretty pictures are not enough.
The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force expanding the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research. Scientists have discovered that the universe is made of unknown matter and is being pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Other discoveries are also amazing. Neuroscientists found that our perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this out so we don't notice. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans first lived and why they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's design.
Science is not close to being complete. In fact, we are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some top physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people think the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is enjoyable. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both are important and create a complete picture that I value. The trees provide shade and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colors attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started writing, I have switched between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories, and after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two because they might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but memorable. Writing short stories expanded my fictional world, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is nice because they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story, though I might revise it many times. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You can finish a short story quickly and move on. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I'll finish. So, writing short stories is a good change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It's like jazz improvisation, where the story leads you. Also, with short stories, you don't have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn't work, you can just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. This is comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in your next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories' successes and failures. Short stories are like experiments for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be harder. My short stories are like shadows or footprints I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like signs to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,C2,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is clear to experts, but its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and its mistakes are either ignored or exaggerated. 
Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced by new ones. Like in music, new ideas are sometimes mocked before they become accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. The history of science is about these conflicts. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. We will admire the creativity of these ideas but also question them, recognizing both their brilliance and their limits.
Science is always changing. Scientists often disprove each other's theories. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics challenged this view, showing that observing the universe can change it. Some people think this shows science can't fully explain the universe, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing.
At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people think we are close to a complete theory of everything. Maybe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the world their children will live in and the kind of children they will have. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. Deciding how to use science is not just for philosophers; it affects national budgets, health, and even the future of life on Earth."
5,C2,"Since around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed book. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about new technologies and changes. Historically, whenever a new technology appears, people often predict the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. In 1894, some thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, television, and smartphones, all thought to threaten print books at some point. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the book's death often appears during technological changes, reflecting our hopes and fears about these changes. We form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we bond with objects like books, TVs, and computers, sometimes even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers comes along, it not only brings economic and social changes but also affects our bond with familiar things. As technology advances, we often miss what we used to have, which is why industries around retro products and older technologies thrive. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people sought original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have made people appreciate the physical quality of old books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power to change and our resistance to it. We often use familiar story patterns, like tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the book's death reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our personal world and identity."
6,C2,"For a year and a half, almost every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest minds in the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By focusing on the simple details of their daily lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I aimed to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to paint a picture of these artists as regular people with habits, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the conditions for creativity, not the creative work itself. It’s about how things are made, not what they mean. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about your inner self. My book explores questions I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while also making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is short, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions, as they might only be solved individually. But I’ve tried to show how different successful people have faced these challenges. I wanted to demonstrate how big creative ideas are built from small daily actions and how work habits affect the work itself. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about routines. A routine might seem ordinary, but it can be a powerful tool for using limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can help focus your mental energy and keep you from being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, James himself often procrastinated and couldn’t stick to a schedule. This book was actually born from my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was at work trying to write a story due the next day, but instead, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a morning person, focused in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for other writers’ work schedules. I found them easily and thought someone should collect these stories, which led to my Daily Routines blog and now this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the variety of voices that made the blog popular. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
7,C1,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of an increase in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. From then on, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of university, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was interested in the very early history of life, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied ancient, delicate creatures in grey rocks. 
When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job, especially in the kind of place he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving something doesn't always mean you get it. The process of getting an academic job can be unfair. When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied, but he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife, crashed his car, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and the professor who replaced him wanted to block the appointment of the first professor's favorite candidate. This led to Howard getting the job. Howard was surprised and grateful, but later a colleague explained what really happened. Howard was a little disappointed but happy to have the job he wanted.
Howard often thought about how his work life was organized and planned, unlike the chaos of personal life. He realized that strangers could change your life, like when his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he went back to the college, postponed the lecture, and reported the theft. Then he had coffee with a colleague and a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils there, which would be his biggest challenge and secure his career. If his briefcase hadn't been stolen, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,C1,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. In his office at Oxford University, he mentions having ice cream made from bee larvae at home. Although they look like maggots, they taste 'slightly nutty and floral.' Making bug-eating normal is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. His research influences what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurants. This field of study is called gastro physics. It looks at how different factors, like who we eat with or the color of our plates, affect our taste experience. 
Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, shares many interesting insights. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most. Also, we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others. 
Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and not high-tech. It has soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford their own research. Much of his funding comes from a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was not seen as 'proper science' in universities. But now, universities are encouraged to show that their work has real-world impact. 
Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, often without customers noticing. Research shows that if people know about these changes, they focus on the taste and might not like it as much. 
Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a big food company. Together, they created the 'Sound of the Sea' dish, which combines sound and flavor. Spence found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. 
At home, Spence's dinner parties are quite unique. Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery, and another time they used remote-controlled lights. They have also experimented with different sounds and drinks to see how they affect taste. For Spence, home, shops, and food events are all part of his lab."
9,C1,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, fake facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows. Smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried something will fall. Even though we think we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can make our thinking unclear. Multitasking also creates a craving for new things, distracting us. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to focus, is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former professor of psychology, calls it info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while an unread email is in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This loss is greater than the loss from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is hard on our brains. Small decisions use the same brain resources as big ones, leading to poor decisions. In talking with business leaders and scientists, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not about email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other things done."
10,C1,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can't find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not considered important. Scientists focused on animal behaviors and their outcomes, not on whether animals have feelings or moral systems. But recently, this has started to change. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has led to popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". These books have started a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a conscience, a sense of right and wrong? 
In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Those that opened the gate themselves showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we produce and eat beef? The observations are clear, but their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the edge of a major ethical change, like the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, says we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler version of our mind. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. The disagreement is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever know what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asked?
Balcombe describes an important experiment he did that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with lots of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups were first fed tasty worms from one box and bad-tasting worms from another, and they learned to eat only from the tasty box. Later, when only bad-tasting worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear opinion. He says, ""We look back with horror at times of racism. Our view on animals will be the same one day. We can't support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger."" If Balcombe were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his view. Manning, who wrote a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour,"" says, ""We are seeing a change. In the early 20th century, some thought animals were just like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are swinging back. But it is a controversial topic, and you want to avoid the noise of academics with personal opinions."""
11,C1,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way of understanding what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that people often think arguments help find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, it might also change how we solve complex problems, making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are surrounded by a lot of poor but attractive ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Surprisingly, having more data doesn't always lead to better knowledge or decisions.
The National Endowment for the Arts reports that reading literature has dropped by 10%, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media, like TV and video games, might reduce critical thinking. She says that less reading might be linked to this decline because people now focus more on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing.
We don't yet have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. Technology's impact is complex, and it can be both good and bad. For example, a computer game might help or harm critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis skills, but constantly clicking on links might prevent deeper thinking. Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers, says that technology changes how we think. Reading helps imagination and critical thinking, while visual media can improve some information processing but often don't allow time for reflection.
Many young people might not reach their full potential because of how they use technology. Society's view of technology affects how we think about critical thinking. Video games are a good example of this conflict. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games can be a great learning tool, not just entertainment. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in realistic virtual worlds. These games allow players to explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise.
In today's digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,C1,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who used to work in an office and for social policy institutions. He left that life because he was unhappy with it. He wrote a book about the benefits of manual work and another book about dealing with modern life. Crawford got the idea for his latest book when he noticed ads appearing on a credit card machine while he was shopping. He realized that these ads and other distractions are hard to avoid and make it difficult for us to focus on what we want. This constant interruption makes us less likely to talk to strangers and more likely to isolate ourselves.
Crawford says that we often experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us. These distractions can take over our lives. Many people, like office workers who complain about emails but spend their free time on them, are worried about this. Studies show that just having a phone visible can distract us. While there's no scientific proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, we are more aware of other things we could be doing.
Crawford believes that technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves, which affects our social lives. We prefer texting to talking because it's easier. By only interacting with digital versions of people, we might lose important social skills. Crawford gives the example of his gym, where people used to share music but now listen to their own with earbuds. This change has made the gym less social.
Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he thinks we should engage in skilled activities that connect us with the real world. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real situations. These activities require good judgment and interaction with others. Engaging with the real world makes digital experiences seem less important.
Crawford doesn't think everyone should become a chef, but he believes it's important to use our judgment. Focusing on one thing can help us concentrate better on other things too."
13,C1,"""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question we ask each other. We often define ourselves by our jobs, and usually, we answer this question in a few words. But when you're a philosopher, like me, it's a bit more complicated. Calling yourself a philosopher can sound pretentious. Saying you study or teach philosophy is fine, but saying you are a philosopher might make people think you claim to know some special truth. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. So why do people have this stereotype about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others' actions and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, was the best life. Not many modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked to thinking deeply. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living,’ meaning that just accepting what society says is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices. But living an examined life doesn't mean you have to read a lot of philosophy books or spend all your time thinking. It means looking closely at your daily life to make sure it is meaningful. You don't have to be a wise person living away from society to do this. In fact, examining life is practical and should be shared with others because it's important for a good life. Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become very separate from everyday life, especially for people who haven't studied it formally. This isn't entirely philosophers' fault: universities focus on expensive and hard-to-access journals. So, philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. For most people, philosophy can seem far from reality. If philosophers used to challenge this idea, many don't anymore. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy have become more focused on specific, technical debates, explaining them to people outside the field is hard, and even harder for those without training. Philosophy, in some cases, has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about evaluating human actions. But recently, I feel this title doesn't fully describe my work because ethics is often seen as related to rules and laws. This is a new development in philosophy: ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today try to decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often think about them. But philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is wrong (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people look more closely at their actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find out things we already know; other times, we realize our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, by examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,C1,"People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, philosophers have often used food as a way to talk about other topics, like learning. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related ideas. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus talked about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is now often linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants and food-related businesses, likely because they think it will attract customers if their products are associated with famous philosophers.
Food is a social and cultural experience. It comes from historical backgrounds and is shared with people in our communities. These communities provide us with people to eat with and the systems to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than any other product, making it an interesting topic for philosophical study.
Once food is made, critics start discussing and writing about it. But why do they have such an important role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, food critics are just better at describing tastes. This area has not been studied much because philosophers have focused more on vision than taste. This should change.
Another part of food is its beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. However, food is eaten and disappears, unlike art or music, which last over time. So, some think food cannot be considered a true art form.
There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often show our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices.
Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of personal relationships. At home, everyone shares food and friendship. Professional cooks have duties to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are only for qualified people, and their relationships are professional.
A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by enjoying food from other cultures and by eating together, which has a long history in international diplomacy. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories, making the topic of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,C1,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a storyline or if decisions made in one game could affect the next. He changed a classic board game called Risk to make a new version: Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have a lasting effect. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules at key moments. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and long-term rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’ 
Daviau was then asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very successful, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was not based on an earlier game. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said: ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.’
Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a small interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is different and pretty good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks a lot of rules. I thought only a few people would like it.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it’s a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and you get that with legacy games.’ Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the adventure was more important than worries about the game’s lifespan. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and ruining the board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It adds a story like in video games.’
The legacy format is influenced by video games and the demand for episodic entertainment from TV series. Daviau once wanted to be a TV writer but moved to advertising and then game design. He still loves telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start,’ he said. ‘But you also need more than just an outline.’ While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is interested in seeing how others develop the idea. But he also thinks people might soon ask: ‘What’s next?’ Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, believes the legacy format is groundbreaking. ‘It changes how you think about what a board game can be,’ he said."
16,C1,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children's movie, was shared widely online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to imagine animals behaving like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very intelligent but look very different from us. Octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.
Some people think that giving animals human-like traits is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes the opposite. He argues that ignoring the human-like traits of animals, which he calls ""anthropodenial,"" is more common. By studying animal behavior, he shows that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.
In the past, people believed animals had complex minds. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said that the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind.
In the 20th century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines that responded to stimuli or as robots with instincts. People who thought animals had inner lives were considered unscientific. This view coincided with humans destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.
Fortunately, de Waal believes we are now recognizing animal intelligence more. He says that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the specific traits and skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts. In her book ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might think we are not very smart because we can't change our skin color like they can.
De Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape story. He thinks it's unlikely that Inky knew how to find a drain leading to the ocean. However, he acknowledges that viral stories can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers were upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video clip of the experiment convinced more people of the findings. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways."
17,C1,"Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to the impact of industrialisation. Robots have been used in car and manufacturing industries for many years, but experts say we are close to a big change where robots will be used in many more areas. However, many people are not ready for this change. Most people think robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, but they also believe their own jobs will still exist. This is not true, as robotic automation will affect every industry soon. 
For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that would take two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a startup called Simbe Robotics has introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check if products are stocked and priced correctly.
Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot yet service or program themselves, which means new jobs will be created for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. Critics, however, worry that we are not ready for the loss of human interaction in jobs. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will create laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but there will still be a lack of skilled workers.
Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be affected by automation and need to retrain themselves, as they cannot rely on the government to protect their jobs. New developments in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, like robots that live with us at home and interact with us in advanced ways. This presents a big opportunity for companies but also challenges, such as creating new rules to keep us safe. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it's there."" This response reflects a common curiosity: why do people risk their lives for something that seems pointless? Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams and face the unknown. It suggests that climbing might be about adventure and fun. 
In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He believed that the way you climb, like using more or less equipment, should follow the rules of the specific climbing activity. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in Western climbing culture, influencing everything from magazines to discussions around campfires.
Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also be very limiting, like when you're stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. But some argue that the simplicity of climbing, with its limited choices, is a form of freedom itself.
US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective. He suggests asking ""Why do people climb?"" instead of just ""Why climb?"" Fitschen believes that climbing is part of our nature as humans. It's in our genes to take on challenges and push our limits, even if it's risky. So, the joy of climbing might be more about our biology than logical reasons.
US academic Brian Treanor adds another view. He thinks climbing helps develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing, then, can help us develop qualities that are useful in everyday life.
Another idea is that climbers who don't rely on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson argued that climbing achievements done independently deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or artificial aids, like bottled oxygen. This view sparked some controversy, as it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.
Finally, some people look at climbing from a non-Western perspective. Climbers often talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, the meditative state during a climb, and intuitive problem-solving are key parts of climbing. These aspects are similar to Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This connection offers another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
79,C2,"In recent years, both in the UK and internationally, there has been a trend in further and higher education to involve students in research early in their studies. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries, but it is also a basic way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your job because they help you think about the world and do your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if this were different? These questions are the basis of research.
Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex and groundbreaking research done by highly trained people, leading to big changes and new knowledge. On the other end, research can be everyday inquiries that involve careful work and asking thoughtful questions about issues and practices. Most students have done some research before, like for school projects or at work. You have been asking questions and doing investigations since you first became interested in studying. You also use research skills in everyday life, like planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, or shopping online.
In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, critically exploring information, and creating your own responses are expected. Some students might find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge, but in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning knowledge and authorities is encouraged.
Critical thinking is very important in research. We need to not just repeat what we read but engage with it, think about it, and test it. We should check if the information is logical and backed by evidence, rather than just accepting it as fact. We must be careful not to rely uncritically on information given to us."
80,C2,"Cities have always been places where people share ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural. 
Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. We know that living in a city can be tiring, but new research shows that it can also make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a small view of nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from the busy city life.
This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy street, our brains have to keep track of many things: distracted people, traffic, and the confusing city layout. This constant attention is tiring because our brains have to decide what to focus on and what to ignore. 
Natural places, on the other hand, don't need as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can refresh our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.
Even before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people try many things to boost brain power, like energy drinks or changing office layouts, simply walking in nature seems to be very effective.
Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities keep growing. Why? Because the same things that make city life hard, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The many social interactions in cities drive creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a place of new ideas, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of technology and creativity. Less crowded cities might have less innovation over time.
The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people get tired of nature and want to return to the city."
81,C2,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to support this idea. However, I believe that the study of the mind should not be limited to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in human thinking. Archaeology shows that things like stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and the development of the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might also be part of the mind.
It is easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from the objects around them. This is necessary for neuroscientists because of the limitations of brain-scanning machines. But this approach often ignores that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I am not denying the importance of the brain in thinking, but I believe the mind is more than just the brain. It is useful to consider that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world.
This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become extensions of our thinking, like when we use clay to make numbers or a stone to make a tool. It also looks at how these interactions have changed over time and what they mean for how we think. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of what objects do for the mind.
Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s sense of self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be continuous. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick becomes part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence is adaptable and can change by incorporating new technologies.
I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, from early stone tools to the internet, tools have served as pathways for humans to explore and understand the world. Unlike a monkey using a stick to get food, humans use tools to satisfy their curiosity. This unique human trait explains why we create things and how these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world.
I want to include material objects in our understanding of the mind. MET provides a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from stone axes to smartphones, have helped define and transform who we are and how we think. While mind-changing technology might sound futuristic, humans have been using it since we first evolved."
82,C1,"Photography is one of the inventions that has greatly changed how we see the world. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became a part of American culture. It influenced many areas, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians say that photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. Photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discussions, so to understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.
Why was photography so popular? First, because it was a mechanical process, it fit well with the growing interest in technology in the US, where change was seen as normal. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world feel smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with amazing speed. Second, the camera was the best tool for showing one's self-image in a country where personal and national identities were always being created and recreated. Third, the camera was important for creating and keeping family memories, even if they were a bit idealized. Lastly, the realistic nature of photographs matched the American artists' focus on realism and everyday life. 
A photograph draws attention to something the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""This, you should see!"" Because a photograph is made by a machine, it is a record of what was in front of the camera, giving it a sense of objectivity. However, since it is taken by a person, it also has a personal point of view, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, which is why photography is often called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph is more complex. No image is shown to us without some context that affects how we understand it, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and how it was first seen. The same image can be seen in different places and times, and its meaning can change each time.
For a long time, the camera's importance to artists was not widely known, but now it is very clear. In recent decades, starting with US artist Andy Warhol, who used photographs in his paintings and other works, artists have been using photographs in many ways. In short, photography has become an essential part of art, working alongside painting to shape our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,C1,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, which includes our thoughts and feelings, and we try to understand it. James was mainly interested in human psychology, which he believed included thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences, which may not always align with scientific facts. 
We often act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex topics, like brainwashing or why people behave in certain ways. Problems occur when people have different views. Formal psychology tries to find the most accurate explanations for these situations. Psychologists help us separate our personal thoughts from scientific facts. 
Psychology studies the mind and brain, but we don't fully understand the brain's role in our experiences and behaviors. It's hard to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn by observing behavior and forming ideas about what's happening inside us. Scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not directly visible. We infer them from behavior, much like solving a crossword puzzle by interpreting clues. 
Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply this knowledge to improve people's lives. Psychological research has helped in areas like teaching, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings. 
Although people have discussed psychological questions for centuries, scientific study began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to study the mind, but this method has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of the brain's work. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,C1,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows the other side of consumer capitalism, which is usually focused on success. Here, you can find products like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were taken off the market because almost no one wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story about the people who designed, marketed, and sold it. 
The surprising thing about the museum is that it is a successful business. You might think that companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but they often don't. Many business executives visit the museum because they don't have their own records of failures. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failures. Since the 1960s, he collected samples of every new product he could find. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection mostly consists of unsuccessful ones.
Today's culture of optimism might be why these failed products exist. Each product went through meetings where no one realized it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might spend more money on a failing product to force some sales and save face. People involved often don't talk about what went wrong. This focus on optimism is common in the growing self-help industry, where ""positive visualization"" is popular. The idea is that if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to happen. 
Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that our brains might be wired to be overly optimistic. Her research shows that well-balanced people often think they have more control over events than they actually do, unlike those with depression. However, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that thinking too positively about the future can reduce motivation. People who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less.
Psychologist Carol Dweck says our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a ""fixed theory"" mindset think ability is natural and unchangeable, so they see failure as proof they aren't good enough. For example, a sports star who believes he is a ""natural"" might not practice enough to improve. On the other hand, people with an ""incremental theory"" mindset believe ability grows with effort and challenges. They see failure as a sign they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger after being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."
85,C1,"Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many theories about home advantage. On the other hand, people who manage the money in sports wonder if home advantage should matter at all. If players are paid well, shouldn't they perform well anywhere?
What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their support is crucial for the team. Fans often think that when they cheer loudly, it helps the team score. They remember the times when cheering led to a goal but forget the times it didn't.
However, there is one thing that fans believe which is supported by science. Home fans often try to influence the referee by making noise. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees might avoid making decisions that would upset the home crowd.
Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in English football won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar. Despite these changes, home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because basketball relies more on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home.
Another reason for home advantage could be related to players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This might be a natural urge to defend their home ground. In recent rugby matches, underdog teams won at home by showing determination and aggression, which are signs of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,C1,"""The more I practise, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous among athletes and coaches. It suggests that practice leads to improvement, not actual luck. The saying is often debated, with some people thinking talent is natural, while others believe it is developed through practice. 
Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for the idea that anyone can become an expert with 10,000 hours of practice. This idea has been popularized by books like Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers"" and others that argue practice is more important than natural talent. They suggest that 10,000 hours of practice is enough to become an expert in any field. 
However, in his book, Epstein argues that this is not always true. He points out that studies often focus only on successful people, which can be misleading. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others do not, considering factors like environment, support, and determination. 
Epstein travels around the world to find answers, even looking at sled dog races in Alaska. He learns that the dogs' drive might be partly genetic, suggesting that determination could also be influenced by genes. This shows the complexity of the nature versus nurture debate. 
Epstein talks about the importance of both natural ability (nature) and practice (nurture) in sports. He believes that both are necessary for success. For example, if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of a sprinter. 
Epstein also discusses race and gender in sports. He questions why men and women compete separately if practice is the only thing that matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most important."
87,C1,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature. She believes this is the main problem. This idea is supported by other studies on modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they spent time exploring outdoors, which they believe was healthier than the protected lives of children today. However, these adults often forget that they are the ones who have created these protective environments for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.
Griffiths' book includes strong arguments about the fear of outdoor dangers and how it benefits the toy and gadget industry, which sells products to keep children entertained indoors. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. While some of these rules might be exaggerated, Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly and passionately. She also discusses childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules. Although her arguments are interesting, Griffiths sometimes takes them too far and ignores important counter-arguments. For example, she compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems extreme.
Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children, often seeing them in an idealized way. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks, arguing that they need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children may want the adventurous life she describes. Some children are naturally cautious and prefer staying at home. The real issue might be forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,C1,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my schooling. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, and moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We no longer need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate problems, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit if they want. This makes play democratic because players must keep each other happy to continue. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, warnings from experts, less community, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They need to follow their natural drive to play and explore to become strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,C1,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to directly contact potential employers, which was once only possible by standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with this access, there is also a higher chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to use her contacts to get a job. The executive was upset by this request and sent a harsh rejection note, which went viral online. Many people who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone. However, this incident highlights the importance of using social media carefully for professional purposes. Social media can be risky for job seekers who don't know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes. 
There is an irony because social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress and experiment, often based on fantasy. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. By choosing the right pictures or songs for your Facebook page, you could become a different person overnight. But when it comes to professional networking, our experience with sites like Facebook might actually be a problem. Using social media for work is very different, but some young people don't see the difference. We first became popular online by being bold and confident, which might explain why some of us still think this is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook doesn't mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you're worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn't apply anymore, and we must meet employers' standards to succeed in the job market.
One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too familiar and seem arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of young people as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are desperate to find jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their job prospects, even though they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees. So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, generic messages, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it requires careful handling to avoid closing doors."
90,C1,"Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people buying UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001, according to the Pew Research Centre. Some people say that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. For example, in 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here today, even with the arrival of cinema and television. Radio has done well despite TV, and cinema has survived videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales increasing by 745% since 2008.
Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. People started to believe that everything is always changing, and they needed regular news updates. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and big events like famines or floods, which they couldn't predict. Life was seen as cyclical, with important truths repeating over time.
Journalism as a full-time job only started in the 19th century. Before that, there was no clear reason for people to need regular news. Newspapers have always had the challenge of publishing regularly and in a fixed format. Online news is different because readers can choose what news to read based on their interests. Search engines and algorithms help personalize news. Online news can update stories quickly and correct mistakes. There are no space limits, so stories can be detailed, and readers can access full documents or events mentioned in the news.
Despite these advantages, online news often focuses on being first and getting reader comments, which can create confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. In some ways, we are returning to that kind of world. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand the world better, even as the internet makes us feel like we live in a chaotic universe."
91,C1,"If humans were comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, just like many animals that are active at night. However, we are creatures that are active during the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a basic part of our nature, even if we don't often think about it. This is why we have changed the night by adding artificial light. This change, like building a dam on a river, has benefits but also causes problems, known as light pollution. Scientists are just starting to study these effects.
Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design, which lets artificial light shine into the sky instead of focusing it on the ground. This extra light changes the natural darkness of night, affecting the light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it can affect things like migration, reproduction, and feeding.
For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few houses had gas lighting, and public gaslights in the streets would not appear for another seven years. From a few miles away, you would have been more likely to smell London than see its faint glow.
We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but that is not true. Many animals, especially mammals, are active at night. Light is a strong force in nature, attracting many species. For example, songbirds and seabirds can be drawn to bright lights on land or from oil platforms at sea, flying around them until they are exhausted. Birds migrating at night can crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially at risk. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at unusual times when there is artificial light.
People used to think light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. While most of us don't need a perfect view of the night sky, we do need darkness. Ignoring the need for darkness is pointless. It is as important for our health as light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can cause health problems. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping is a natural response to the Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so important that changing them is like changing our balance.
In the end, humans are affected by light pollution just like animals near bright lights. By creating so much artificial light, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the natural day-night cycle. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, which we can best understand by looking at a dark night sky with the Milky Way above us."
92,C1,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his company will stop keeping track of employees' paid holiday time. This idea was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. Some people think this announcement is just a way to make the company seem more friendly, but let's consider if the idea is practical.
The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn't hurt the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work better. In a big company, it's harder to know if your absence will affect the business.
The founder of the multinational company said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work is up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? Even if you prepare well before a holiday, there will always be work waiting for you when you return. This is just how taking leave works. If employees follow these rules, they might not take any leave at all, or they might feel guilty about it. Feeling guilty can lead to stress, and not taking enough leave can reduce productivity over time.
There could also be pressure from coworkers and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. This pressure already affects decisions like when to start and end the workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If the feeling of safety that comes with guaranteed leave is removed, people might feel they can't take the leave they need because they don't want to seem lazy. They wouldn't have their legal right to leave to rely on anymore.
This policy might make employees feel stuck, unable to take their leave, or they might just stick to their legal rights, making the policy useless. Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, anywhere, which has blurred the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how this new way of working could fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours accurately, why should it use an old standard for time off?
However, if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being watched, making them monitor themselves, which could be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits like better morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can happen without affecting worker well-being. I am doubtful that letting employees ""take as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,C1,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts in a field review a scientific paper before it is published. This is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research by preventing flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, this process can delay publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trust in scientific literature? The answer is both yes and no. 
The world of scientific publishing is changing. While I still believe in some form of review before publication, the rise of preprints is changing things. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before peer review. They allow for quick sharing of new research so others can read, critique, and build on it. 
Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can lead to authors cutting corners. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is suitable for a journal based on its popularity or newsworthiness, not just its scientific quality. These issues are known, but few are willing to change the current system.
Preprints might offer a solution. They have been around for twenty years but are not widely used because of misconceptions. Some believe journals won't accept papers that have been shared as preprints, and there is fear that without peer review, 'junk science' will be published. However, preprints are open for critique by a global community, which can be just as effective.
Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper critiqued another published paper, which is difficult in traditional journals. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and all discussions were open for readers to see. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments are still available, so the work is not wasted.
Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions and can be a place for sharing negative results, which are often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Papers on preprint archives are read and cited more, showing their effectiveness in spreading research. By using the internet's openness, preprints can help focus on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,C1,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it’s like ‘a painting in words’. These answers don’t usually satisfy me or them. So, one day, I asked them to pick an object and write two paragraphs: one describing it like a scientist, and another from the object’s point of view, titled ‘Poem’. One student wrote: 
Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. 
The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. 
When I was in school, poetry didn’t make much sense to me. I thought of poems as confusing puzzles that blocked real understanding and feeling. After school, many people lose interest in poetry. Sometimes you come across a poem, and it stands out because it’s not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down because it seems plain or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. 
What do we expect from poems? Aren’t they supposed to hold deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem yes. But for emotions, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, it’s hard to beat the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. 
However, poems can offer something special: ambiguity. Everyday life is full of it, unlike straightforward reading. But this doesn’t really explain what a poem is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it leads you to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of literary art using the beauty and rhythm of language’. This is academic talk, but it hides the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made’, and a poet is ‘a maker of things’. So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? 
Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – carefully made and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t hold up on closer look. The best part of comparing poems is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps us think differently and see common things in a new way. 
Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially if we think about how song lyrics stick in our heads. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes such as ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? 
Consider a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, looking right at you: A poem can hit home like nothing else, even though, as ink on paper, it does no more than the prose around it. What about all the empty space around the poem – space that could be used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it doesn’t become a product like they do. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry books, but few expect them to make back their printing costs. A poem is not made for the market, but for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
