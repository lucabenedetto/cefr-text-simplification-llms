1,C2,"'A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. The website said that when you say, ""Hey, I’m here,"" you are also telling everyone, even people you don’t know. This made people think that sharing everything online might not be good. The internet lets us share our lives with many people. We can become famous or rich! So, we share our stories and photos online. But sometimes, we find out that it can be dangerous and confusing. 
In the early days of the internet, some people tried sharing their lives online. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with being famous. These people were the first bloggers. They learned lessons that we can learn from too. 
In 1994, a student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. He wrote about everything and shared photos. People liked reading about his life. But one day, he had to stop because it caused problems in his personal life. He learned that sharing too much online can make people not trust you.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong wrote about her job on her blog. Someone at her job saw it and told her bosses. She lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. But later, Heather started writing about her family and became very popular. She learned to share carefully online.
The internet lets us say anything, but we should be careful about what we share.'"
2,C2,"'Some scientists talked about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? This movie mixed real facts and stories to show that there is a lot about our universe we do not understand. Scientists agree that we do not know everything about the universe. But some scientists did not like the movie. They said it was bad and even dangerous. 
At first, the movie seemed okay. It showed scientists saying that new discoveries make the universe seem stranger than we thought. But then, the movie talked about water changing because of thoughts. It showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after happy thoughts and not nice after bad thoughts. Some people liked this idea, but many scientists did not believe it. They wanted real proof, not just pictures.
The movie's ideas were not strange enough. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is pushed by something called 'dark energy'. This is real and comes from many years of research. Scientists also found that our brains take half a second to understand what we see. They also found where modern humans came from and how they spread around the world.
Science is not finished. We still have a lot to learn. Some scientists are trying to find a Theory of Everything to explain all forces and particles in the universe. Many people think the universe is amazing.'"
3,C2,"I like writing stories. Writing long stories, called novels, is hard. Writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like making a big forest. Writing a short story is like making a small garden. Both are important to me. 
When I write a novel, I do not write short stories. When I write short stories, I do not write a novel. I started writing short stories in 1984. It was new for me, but I enjoyed it. People liked my short stories too. One of my first short stories was 'Breaking Waves'. It was in my first book of short stories.
Short stories are quick to write. I can finish one in about a week. Novels take a long time, maybe one or two years. Short stories can come from small ideas, like a word or a picture. It is like playing jazz music. If a short story is not good, it is okay. Not all stories are perfect. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver did not write perfect stories every time.
I learn from writing short stories. They help me write better novels. Short stories are like small steps I take. I remember each one and how I felt. They show my feelings, and I like sharing them with readers."
4,C2,"Science is about learning and understanding the world. It helps us in many ways, like curing diseases. Science tries to understand small things like ants and big things like the universe. Sometimes, science changes what we know. New ideas can be hard to accept at first, but they can become important later. Scientists often disagree, but this helps science grow. 
Science is always changing. One scientist might find a new idea that changes what we thought before. Sometimes, these changes are big and make us think differently about the world. For example, a long time ago, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Later, scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein found new ideas that changed this view.
Science has given us many new things, like X-rays and the idea of the Big Bang. Some people think we might soon understand everything about the universe. Science is important because it helps us control and change the world. But we must be careful because changes can affect nature. Everyone should know about science because it affects our future and our children's future."
5,C2,"'Around 2015, big book companies saw that ebook sales stopped growing or went down. This made people wonder if ebooks would be popular for a long time. Some people thought ebooks were too exciting and spent too much money on them. They forgot how nice paper books are. People still ask if ebooks will replace paper books. This question makes us think a lot. Why do we think ebooks and paper books are fighting? This is because we feel excited and scared about new things. In the past, people thought new things would end old things. When TV came, people thought radio would end, but radio found new ways to be useful. People listened to it in cars and at work. Long ago, people thought audiobooks would replace paper books. Many times, people thought new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end paper books. Some people worried this would be bad for culture. Others thought ebooks were much better. We often think about the end of books when new technology comes. We love things like books and TVs because they are part of our lives. When new things come, we have to change how we feel about old things. This makes us miss the old things. That's why people like old products. When printing started in the 15th century, people wanted old handwritten books. When movies got sound, people missed silent movies. The same happened with photos and music records. Ebooks made people like old paper books more. This shows that paper books might not go away. We like stories about change and endings because they help us understand new things. These stories show our excitement for the future and our fear of losing what we know.'"
6,C2,"'Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how famous people from the past 400 years did their best work. I wanted to know how they found time to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives, like when they slept, ate, and worked. I wanted to show their habits and routines. 
The book is called Daily Rituals. It is about people's routines. A routine is something you do every day without thinking much. A good routine can help you use your time well. The psychologist William James said good habits can help us do more interesting things. But he was not good at keeping a schedule himself.
I got the idea for this book one Sunday. I was at work, trying to write a story. But I was wasting time, cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a morning person, so I work best in the morning. That day, I looked online for other writers' schedules. I found many stories and thought someone should collect them. So, I started a blog called Daily Routines and then wrote this book.
For the book, I found more stories and did more research. I let the people speak for themselves with quotes from letters and interviews. I also used other sources to describe their routines. I thank the many writers and researchers whose work helped me. You can find all my sources in the Notes section for more reading.'"
7,C1,"Howard loved fossils. When he was six, his family could not go to Spain for a holiday because of money problems. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found a fossil called an ammonite on the beach. This made him want to study old rocks and fossils. 
At university, Howard decided he wanted to study very old fossils, not dinosaurs. He liked studying tiny creatures in rocks. After finishing his studies, he worried about finding a job. He wanted to work at a good place. 
Howard applied for a job at Tavistock College in London. On the day of his interview, the main professor had an accident and could not come. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, helped Howard get the job. Howard was happy to get the job, even though he knew it was because of the professor's dislike for the other candidate.
One day, someone stole Howard's briefcase with his lecture notes. He was upset but went for coffee. There, he met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. The visitor told him about new fossils at the museum. Howard was excited and changed his plans. He decided to visit the museum in Nairobi to study the fossils. This was a big chance for his career."
8,C1,"Charles Spence likes to eat many different foods. He even has ice cream made from bee larvae at home. It tastes a bit like nuts and flowers. Charles is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to make us taste food. His work helps big food companies and famous restaurants decide what to put on their menus.
Charles and his team look at many things that change how we taste food. This includes who we eat with, how food looks on the plate, and even the sounds we hear while eating. For example, people eat more when they are with others. Also, music can change how sweet or bitter food tastes.
Charles works in a simple lab with old equipment. He gets money from big food companies to do his research. This helps him work with chefs who cannot pay for research. He helps companies reduce salt and sugar in food without people noticing.
Charles also works with a famous chef named Heston Blumenthal. Together, they created a dish called 'Sound of the Sea' that uses sound to change how food tastes. Charles found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and low-pitched music makes it taste bitter.
Charles's work is used by many food companies. For example, an airline will use music to make food taste better for passengers. At home, Charles likes to have fun with food. He has dinner parties with special lights and sounds to see how they change the taste of food."
9,C1,"'Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, some true and some not. We have to decide what is important and what is not. We also do many things ourselves now. Before, travel agents helped us with flights, and salespeople helped us in shops. Now, we do these things alone. We try to do many things at once, like work, family, hobbies, and watching TV. Our smartphones help us do this. But doing many things at once is not good. Earl Miller, a brain expert, says our brains cannot do many things at the same time. We switch from one thing to another very fast, and this is not good for our brains. We think we do a lot, but we are less efficient. Doing many things at once makes us stressed and confused. Our brains like new things, so we get distracted easily. Just having the chance to do many things at once is bad for our brains. Glenn Wilson, a psychology expert, says trying to focus when we have unread emails makes us less smart. Russ Poldrack, another brain expert, says learning while doing other things sends information to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV, the homework information goes to the wrong place in the brain. Making decisions is also hard for our brains. Many small decisions can make us tired and lead to bad big decisions. Email is a big problem. We get too many emails and feel we must answer them, but it is hard to do this and do other things too.'"
10,C1,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night to throw at people during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? 
Fifty years ago, people did not think much about these questions. Scientists watched what animals did and wrote it down. They did not think animals had feelings or thoughts. But now, some scientists are starting to think animals might have feelings. 
Books like ""Wild Justice"" and ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"" talk about animal feelings. This has started a big question: do animals have thoughts like people? 
In one study, cows had to open a gate to get food. Cows that opened the gate themselves were happier than those that needed help. This makes people think about how we treat animals like cows. 
Some people, like Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, say we should stop eating meat because animals have feelings. Others, like Professor Aubrey Manning, say we should think more about how animals think. But Professor Euan MacPhail says we should not think animals are like people. 
This is a hard question because it is not just about science. It is also about what we believe. 
Dr. Balcombe did a study with birds called starlings. Some birds lived in nice cages, and some in bad cages. Birds in nice cages ate bad food when they had to, but birds in bad cages did not. Dr. Balcombe thinks this shows birds can feel sad. 
Dr. Balcombe believes we will one day think about animals like we think about people. Professor Manning agrees that we are changing how we think about animals. 
This is a big topic, and people have different opinions."
11,C1,"'Thinking carefully is a way to understand what we read or hear better. Adrian West, a teacher, says that arguing can help find the truth. Technology helps us keep and use information, but it might also change how we solve problems. We see a lot of ideas and opinions, which can make it hard to think clearly. More information does not always mean better knowledge. Reading books is going down, and this might make thinking less strong. Patricia Greenfield, a teacher, says that watching videos and doing many things at once can make thinking weaker. We do not know exactly how technology changes thinking. Computers and games can be good or bad for thinking. Reading helps us think and imagine, but videos do not. Some videos help with quick thinking, but they do not give time to think deeply. Many young people do not use their full abilities. Video games can be fun and help learn. Games like Sim City teach decision-making and thinking skills. In the digital age, we need to understand how technology changes thinking.'"
12,C1,"Matthew Crawford works as a motorcycle mechanic. Before this, he worked in an office but did not like it. He wrote a book about how working with your hands is good. His new book talks about how to live in today's world. He got the idea when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. He thinks these ads make it hard for us to focus on what we want. We are often distracted and do not talk to people around us. We use phones and games a lot, which can take over our attention. 
Crawford is not the only one worried. Many people feel distracted by emails and phones. When a phone is on the table, it can make us lose focus. This problem is not new; people worried about it even when the telegraph was invented. Technology gives us many choices, and this can be hard for us. We often text instead of talking to friends. 
Crawford says we need to control noise and distractions in public places. He also thinks doing skilled activities, like cooking or playing sports, helps us connect with the real world. These activities need focus and help us work with others. They show us that real experiences are better than digital ones. 
Crawford believes it is important to focus on one thing at a time. This helps us pay attention to what matters and makes us feel better."
13,C1,"""What do you do for work?"" This is a common question. We often talk about our jobs. I am a philosopher, and it is hard to explain my job. Saying ""I am a philosopher"" can sound strange. People might think philosophers know special truths. This is not true. Philosophers are like everyone else. 
Why do people think philosophers are different? One reason is that philosophers think a lot about life. A long time ago, a Greek philosopher named Aristotle said thinking about life is very good. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said we should think about our lives to make them better. 
Thinking about life does not mean reading many books. It means looking at our daily life and making sure it is good. It is important to share what we learn with others. 
Today, philosophy is often in universities. It can seem far from real life. Many people do not understand it. This is because philosophers write in difficult books. They talk to other experts, not to everyone. 
I work in ethics, a part of philosophy. Ethics is about what is right and wrong. It is important to ask if something is good or bad. But philosophy is more than this. It helps us think about our actions and beliefs. By thinking about these things, we can help everyone."
14,C1,"'People who love food think a lot about what and how we eat. In the past, talking about food was not very important in philosophy. Sometimes, philosophers used eating as a way to talk about other things, like learning. One famous philosopher, Epicurus, talked about enjoying life and avoiding pain. Today, people think of him when they talk about enjoying food and drink. We see his name in restaurants and food shops. Food is important in our culture. It comes from history and we share it with others. We eat with friends and family. Food is everywhere in our lives, so it is interesting to think about. Some people write about food and say what they think about it. They are not special, but they are good at talking about food. We need to think more about how we taste food. We often talk about art, like paintings and music, as beautiful. Some people say food can be art too. But food is eaten and gone, unlike art that stays. There are also questions about what food we should eat, like organic or vegetarian. These choices show what we believe is right. Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. At home, we cook for people we love. In restaurants, chefs cook for their job. Food can also help people from different cultures understand each other. We can learn about others by eating their food and eating together. This helps us make friends from different places.'"
15,C1,"Rob Daviau is from the US. He makes special board games called 'legacy' games. When he was a child, he played many board games. But he thought they were not fun or hard enough anymore. So, he wanted to change them. He asked, ""Can board games have a story? Can choices in one game change the next game?"" 
He changed a board game called Risk. He made a new game called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices change the game forever. Players might have to tear cards or write on the board. Sometimes, they open packets with new rules. The game is played over many sessions. Players remember past games and say, ""You did this!""
Rob also worked on a new version of a game called Pandemic. In this game, players work together to stop diseases. His next game was SeaFall. SeaFall is about ships and exploring new places. 
Making legacy games is hard. Designers must think about all player choices. They use testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga tested SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time. Sometimes, the game works well at first, but later it breaks. Then, they must fix it.
Many people did not think legacy games would be popular. Rob thought only a few people would like them. But many players loved them. Russell Chapman said they are exciting and new. Ben Hogg liked the adventure in the games. He said it is like watching a new movie.
Legacy games are like TV shows. Rob wanted to write for TV, but he made games instead. He likes telling stories. Matt Leacock, who made Pandemic, said making legacy games is like writing a book. You need to know the start and end of the story.
Rob is happy to see others make legacy games. But he thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works with SeaFall, thinks legacy games change how we see board games."
16,C1,"'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. Many people shared this story online. People like stories about animals escaping, like rats and llamas, because it makes us think animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells for protection. Some people think animals are not like humans, but Dr. Frans de Waal says animals are smarter than we think. He studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees. He says animals can think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand others. In the past, people thought animals were smart. Charles Darwin, who studied evolution, said animals and humans are not so different. In the 20th century, people started to think animals were like machines. But now, we are learning more about animal intelligence. Dr. de Waal says we should test animals in ways that suit them. For example, squirrels are good at remembering where they hide nuts. Inky's story shows us that animals are smart, even if we don't know all the details. Dr. de Waal did an experiment with monkeys. He gave them cucumbers or grapes. Monkeys who got cucumbers were upset when others got grapes. A video of this experiment showed people that animals can feel envy. This helps us understand animal minds better.'"
17,C1,"Robots are machines that can do work. In the past, robots were only in stories. Now, robots are real and changing how we work. Robots have been used in car factories for many years. But soon, robots will be in many more places. Some people think robots will do most jobs in the next 50 years. But many people also think their own jobs will stay the same. This is not true. All jobs will change because of robots.
For example, in Australia, a robot called Hadrian X can build walls with bricks very fast. In the USA, a robot named Tally helps in supermarkets. It checks if products are on the shelves and have the right price. Robots like these will change many jobs.
Some people say robots will make new jobs for people who can fix and program them. But others worry that robots will take away jobs that need people to talk and work together. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang studies robots and jobs. He says robots will work with people and other robots soon. Big companies will have special people to manage robots. But there will not be enough workers with the right skills for these jobs.
Dr. Zhang says people need to learn new skills to keep their jobs. Robots will also be in our homes and do new things. This is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. Many jobs might go away, so learning about science and technology is important. This will help people find new jobs in the future."
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous climber, was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He said, ""Because it's there."" People often wonder why someone would do something so dangerous. Some think climbing is about adventure and fun. A writer named Tejada-Flores talked about different types of climbing, like climbing big mountains or small rocks. Each type has its own rules. Many climbers love the feeling of freedom, but sometimes climbing can feel limiting, like when stuck in a tent during a storm. Joe Fitschen, another climber, thinks climbing is in our nature. He says we like to take on challenges. Brian Treanor, a teacher, believes climbing helps us learn important things like courage and respect for nature. Some climbers think climbing without help is better, but it can be more dangerous. Climbing also helps people focus and feel calm, like in Zen philosophy. This is why many people are drawn to climbing."
19,B2,"Alfred Brendel is a famous piano player. He played piano for many years. He is very smart and serious. He played music from Europe. He did not teach many students. One day, a young boy named Kit Armstrong asked Brendel for lessons. At first, Brendel said no. But then he heard Kit play the piano. Kit played very well. Brendel decided to teach him. Kit is now 19 years old. He likes to learn new things like languages and math. He also writes music. Brendel thinks Kit is very good at listening and playing music. Brendel is careful not to say Kit will be a great pianist too soon. Brendel is now 80 years old. He does not play piano in public anymore. He is happy with what he has done in his life."
20,B2,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad's garden was not in a busy city. It was next to a river. You could hear the water and birds singing. I thought all gardens were like this—quiet and peaceful. Grandad's garden was simple. He did not have a greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows.
At home, my dad was sometimes quiet. He liked funny things and had special phrases. He said, ""It's immaterial to me,"" which means ""I don't mind."" He left school without finishing and became a plumber. He did not love plumbing. He and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but they stayed. Dad was good at fixing things at home, like making bookshelves.
My parents moved house only once. My mom liked to change furniture. One day, we got a piano. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. It had two shiny candlesticks. My mom said they were too fancy and took them away. My sister got piano lessons, not me. My mom said I would not practice.
I liked going to the river. I would take a fishing net and look for fish. I wore old sandals and took them off by the river. I tried to catch fish, but they did not live long at home, so I put them back in the river.
I wanted to leave school early. One day, my dad said there was a job for an apprentice gardener. He thought I might like it. Dad did not like gardening, but he saw I loved it. I think he hoped it would be good for me."
21,B2,"Lawrence MacEwen lives on a small island in Scotland called the Isle of Muck. The wind is very strong, but Lawrence is happy on his island. He shows me the other islands nearby. He points and says, ""That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It rains a lot there."" I see the rain on Rum's big mountains. Lawrence says, ""I have to move my sheep,"" and we walk down the hill. He tells me about the island: it is 3 km long and 1.5 km wide. His family has lived there for 3000 years. Lawrence's dog, Tie, helps with the sheep, but sometimes Tie makes mistakes. Lawrence's family runs the island. His wife, Jenny, helps with the farm. His son, Colin, takes care of the cottages. His daughter, Mary, and her husband, Toby, run the hotel. Their children play on the island and sail boats. The island has no electricity sometimes, and there is no mobile phone service. Mary says, ""You can get phone service on the hill, but most people stop using their phones after a few days."" A boat brings food and musicians to the island. The musicians play music, and everyone enjoys it. Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on another island, and Jenny went to manage it. She did not know much about farming, but she was good at typing. I eat fresh fish from the island. The next day, I wait for the ferry to leave the island. Many ferries were canceled before because of bad weather. If my ferry does not come, I will stay on Muck for two more days, which I secretly hope for."
22,B2,"The video game industry used to be small and mostly for computer experts. People thought it was just a hobby for young people. Now, it is a big and serious industry. Making video games is hard. It needs many people and a lot of time. It is not easy to get a job in this industry, but it is growing.
Jim Donelly, who works for a games magazine, says it is hard to work in big companies. But the industry needs more game designers. Not just the bosses, but also people who make small parts of the game. Jim says the best way to get into the industry is to make games. You need to show you can make something.
John Field, another expert, says it is not easy. Many people want to work in games, but not everyone has the skills. A good course in games can help. Most game designers start as programmers or artists. They like all kinds of entertainment and art. They are not just fans; they are interested in the future of games. Knowing people in the industry can also help.
Games are not just for kids anymore. Families play games together. Phones have many games, and social media has games too. John thinks there are many chances to grow in this industry. Games are fun and can also teach us things."
23,B2,"'When I was a child, I loved to play football. My dad helped me, but he did not force me. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. My friend stopped playing football because of this. I am happy my dad was not like that. When I score a goal from far away, people say it is luck, but it is not. I practiced a lot since I was a kid. The best players practice for many years. I learned how to play well. I teach kids to enjoy learning football skills. At school, I played many sports like baseball and basketball. I know school is important, but I only thought about football. I want my son to learn and read books. He is too young to sit still, but we try. At the start of my football career, the manager helped us young players. He did not make a big deal about it. We knew we had to work hard. I scored in the first game, but we lost. A TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win with kids.’ We knew we had to do better. I trust my friends and family. I have a lot of money, but it can be a problem. People ask why my mom still works. I help my parents with money. I paid for their house and bought them a car. My mom loves her job as a hairdresser. I like to help people around me. After I stop playing football, I want to take a break. I want to go skiing, but I cannot now because I might get hurt and not be able to play football.'"
24,B2,"Sam Carter helped us find a place to live at Reef Point. Sam worked for my dad in Los Angeles. My dad couldn't write in Los Angeles, so Sam found us a cheap place to stay. Reef Point was quiet in the summer because of sea fogs. People preferred to go to La Carmella, a nicer place nearby. Only people with little money or surfers came to Reef Point. When the weather got hot, more people came. My dad was busy writing, so I spent time on the beach with my dog, Rusty. Rusty came to us when we moved to Reef Point. I gave him water, and he stayed. My dad joked that Rusty thought we belonged to him. Rusty liked to dig and swim. He sometimes brought me things from the beach, like shoes or towels, which I returned to their owners. One day, my dad went to Los Angeles, and Rusty and I watched surfers. One surfer was very good. She talked to me and asked why I didn't surf. I said I had no surfboard or money. She asked if I was British and if I was visiting. I said I lived there and my dad was writing a movie script. She asked about my dad's name, and I said Rufus Marsh. She knew his book, ""Tall as the Morning,"" and was interested in me after that."
25,B2,"Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on a big ship called the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie told her to come late, but now Violet thought that was bad advice. There was a problem with the computers, and everyone was upset. They paid a lot of money for this trip and wanted it to be nice.
Violet wanted to leave, but she couldn't find her phone. She needed it to call the taxi company to see if she left it there. Her son Harry always told her to be careful with her phone. She asked a nice couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message to ask their neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at home.
Finally, the line moved, and Violet got on the ship. She didn't like the ship's entrance. It looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, and carpets like in airports. She went to the elevator, which was full of tired people. She got out on the twelfth floor and was happy to see her room had a balcony. She paid extra for it because she wanted to see the sea."
26,B2,"John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Vivian Maier, a street photographer. Maloof now has many of Maier's things, like cameras, films, and photos, in his home. He did not know what he had bought at first. Maloof is a flea market seller and could have sold it all. Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier's life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from a shop where she developed film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and lived in France as a child. She came back to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was private and always had a camera. She wore big coats, hats, and strong shoes. On her day off, she took photos all day. Maier liked movies and politics. She was not very social but talked to people on the street and recorded them. She loved taking photos and did it for herself, not for money. Her photos show women, children, old people, and the poor. Photography expert Larry Silverman finds her pictures interesting. He wonders if she made her own style or copied others. Maloof is still looking at all the negatives he has. He was not interested in photography before finding Maier's work. Now, he takes his own photos. Maloof wants people to know about Vivian Maier and her work."
27,B2,"'When a book is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her book. The officer asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is a hard question for a writer. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are many crimes, and 12 men try to solve them. The story is very complex. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a history book, but found the past gave more chances for problems for her characters. The book is over 800 pages because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good part. When I ask how it feels to be successful at a young age, she says it is nice because everyone in her small country feels part of the success. She says, ‘What is annoying is when people think I am not trying to do something deep in the book.’ She wanted to write the book like a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. It gets faster as it goes. I ask if it matters if readers notice this. She says, ‘I wanted to make a book with patterns that don’t matter, but if you care, you can see them.’ Even with its special structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery. She says she didn’t plan the book before writing. ‘I would write myself into a corner, then see how I could get out.’ She also wanted the book to be fun for readers. We talk about her love for TV drama series. I ask if she wants to write for TV. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says. She is very excited when talking about writing and New Zealand. ‘When I come to Britain, my imagination changes because it is a different place. I see why writers leave New Zealand for busy places, to be around many people.’ But for now, New Zealand is her home. I hope it gives her ideas for more books.'"
28,B2,"Jonny Kinkead liked to make things when he was a boy. He used tools in his dad's garage. He also liked to play the guitar. Now, for 40 years, he makes guitars by hand. Jonny loves guitars. He says, ""How can two pieces of wood make a beautiful sound?"" He learned to play guitar at 11 years old. At 16, he wanted a bass guitar. Instead of buying one, he made it himself. He learned how different wood makes different sounds. Jonny and his brothers also made model boats and planes. Their father taught them how to use tools. Jonny fixed instruments for his friends, too. 
Jonny's bass guitar was good, but he did not think about making guitars for a job. He liked painting and sculpture. After school, he studied architecture at university. But he left because he wanted to do something else. He thought guitar-making was like sculpture. He could make things people use. 
Jonny started making guitars for a living. For ten years, he also cleaned windows to make money. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of materials. Later, he became known as a good guitar-maker and could charge more. He still only makes ten guitars a year. 
In the beginning, Jonny went to music festivals to show his guitars. He wanted musicians to try them and tell others. He learned how to price his guitars by talking to musicians. 
Today, it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK. Before, people thought only American guitars were good. Now, UK guitars are respected. Jonny says new guitar-makers should take courses. But he also thinks learning by trying is important. He says, ""Look at other instruments and try different things. If you learn by yourself, you learn everything."""
29,B2,"English people often talk about the weather. This is very common in English conversations. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This was true 200 years ago and is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they find it interesting. But this is not true. The weather in England is not very exciting. There are no big storms or tornadoes. 
Some people, like the writer Bill Bryson, say the English weather is boring. Others, like broadcaster Jeremy Paxman, say it is interesting because it is always changing. But both are missing the point. English people talk about the weather to start conversations. It is a way to say ""hello"" or to fill a quiet moment. 
When someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. They are just starting a conversation. This is like how monkeys groom each other to be friendly. 
There are three main times when English people talk about the weather: 
1. As a greeting.
2. To start a conversation.
3. When there is nothing else to talk about.
Because of this, it seems like English people talk about the weather a lot. But really, it is just a way to be friendly and talk to each other."
30,B2,"Alice Leader was in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was talking to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds. She told them the Romans built the wall 120 km long and 5 meters high 1900 years ago. The students chose this trip instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice did not have a good answer. She wanted a book about life at the Wall in Roman times but could not find one. So, she decided to write it herself. Alice stopped teaching after 31 years and started writing in 2001. She said teaching is like acting and is hard work. Writing is exciting but not as tiring. Her old teaching friends are jealous because she still connects with children through her books. Alice wants to write books that are not too dark or too much fantasy. She likes to teach English and History together. She loves when children go from bored to interested. Writing is like teaching for her. She started writing because her sons were leaving home and her head teacher suggested a writing course. She wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. The course students liked her story and said she should publish it. Alice asked for a year off from school to write her first book. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helped her edit the book. He reads her work and helps make it better. Alice says they work well together."
31,B2,"Jonny and Alistair Brownlee are brothers. They are champion triathletes. A newspaper and a TV company asked them to race for charity. Jonny would drive a car, and Alistair would ride a mountain bike. The race was in the Yorkshire Dales in England. Jonny said, ""I am excited. I can stay warm in the car."" Alistair wore winter cycling clothes. He joked, ""I might stop for tea because I know Jonny's driving.""
The race started at Semerwater lake and ended at Fleet Moss. Alistair had to go up a steep hill first. They shook hands and started. Alistair rode his bike up the hill. Jonny drove the car. Soon, Jonny saw a big tractor on the road. He said, ""If Alistair wins, it's because of this farmer!"" After the tractor moved, Jonny drove on.
Alistair had to carry his bike up the hill. Sheep watched him. Then he reached the top and rode fast. Jonny had trouble with narrow roads in the village. He drove slowly through a stream. Then he drove fast to the finish line.
Alistair was also close to the finish. He rode fast and stopped at the line. He asked, ""Is Jonny here?"" The crowd said, ""No."" Alistair was happy. Jonny arrived a few minutes later. He said, ""Well done,"" but he was disappointed."
32,B2,"'When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the soft grass. You hit the ball and hear the sound. The grass, the old stadium, the players in white clothes, and the quiet people watching make you feel like you are in a different world. The quiet helps me play better. I try to think only about the game and the point I am playing. When a point is over, there is noise: people clap and cheer. I hear them, but it feels far away. I do not think about the many people watching me. I am very focused. In 2008, I played Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final. It was a big match for me. I always wanted to play at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me it was the most important tournament. When I was 14, I dreamed of playing and winning there. Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer twice. In 2006, I was happy to play, even though I lost. But in 2007, losing was very hard. I knew I could play better. I cried a lot after that match. Losing hurts more when you have a chance to win. My uncle Toni usually does not comfort me, but he told me not to cry. He said there would be more chances. I told him he did not understand. I thought it was my last chance. I know a sports career is short, and I want to do my best. Some moments are very important, and I missed one in 2007. But Toni was right. I had another chance in 2008. I learned from my loss. I was sure I would win this time. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends. We did not talk about the match. They knew I was thinking about it in my mind. I needed to keep my focus until the match started.'"
33,B2,"'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in April 1957. She loved Africa and spent most of her life there. Jane was a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, she became famous for her work with chimpanzees. She wrote books for children and adults. One of her books, ""In the Shadow of Man,"" is very popular and has been translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is a well-known female scientist. She helped us understand chimpanzees better. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. They also did not know that chimpanzees have emotions like humans. Jane's book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is important for chimpanzee research. Her study of chimpanzees in Gombe, Nigeria, is a great scientific achievement. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves. As a child, Jane was curious. When she was five, she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. She hid in a henhouse for five hours to find out. This curiosity helped her become a great biologist.'"
34,B2,"Shirley Ford is a voice actor. She can speak like a young boy, a tired mom, an old Scottish woman, and even an alien. People know her voices from TV shows and cartoons. She also does voices for work videos about health and safety. Shirley says doing voiceovers is not just about funny voices. You have to make the script interesting for people who can't see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but it's not easy for them because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.
Shirley went to drama school to become an actor. She sang for TV ads sometimes. One day, someone asked her to try a voice for a cartoon rabbit. She thought it was funny but tried it and got the job. She found out she was good at voices and decided to do more voiceover work. In one film, she did voices for the main character and her family.
Women often do voices for children because their voices are lighter. Shirley learns new voices by watching children's TV. She does many types of voice work, like videos for schools and ads for vacuum cleaners. She says smiling while talking makes your voice sound happy. She enjoys working with other actors in cartoons.
Getting voice work is hard, and you need a good showreel, which is a recording of your voices. Shirley says you need to work hard and not give up. She suggests going to special classes for voiceovers. Shirley loves voices and sometimes talks in different voices even at home. Her children are used to it."
35,B2,"'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. Being a cartoonist is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people choose other jobs, like being a lawyer or working in a car factory. It seems funny to think you can make money by drawing little pictures, but some people do it. Many cartoonists have wanted to draw for a long time. When I was a child, I loved comics and drew for school papers. I studied graphic design in college. After college, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted cartoons about local news. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live. To be a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree or a lot of money. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But it’s not easy. It’s a hard job, and you should only do it if you really love it. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family and hobbies. The more things you can do, the better chance you have to make money with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer and a designer. I take any job because you can learn a lot from work you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart and curious about everything. In the past, many cartoonists worked for newspapers and magazines. Now, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to make and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than very talented artists. Some people worry about others stealing their ideas. But it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does take your cartoon and it becomes popular online, it can be a good thing!'"
36,B2,"'Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house. I decided to throw away an electric guitar. My dad gave it to me for my 16th birthday. It was black and made in Japan. I usually keep old things, but I wanted to throw this guitar away. I took it to the rubbish dump. A young man saw me and asked, ""Are you really throwing that away?"" I said yes. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. Later, I felt sad about it. A few months ago, I got an email from a man named Keith Rushton. He said, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar was sold many times, but Keith found my name on it. He found me online and asked if I wanted to buy it back. I was very happy. Keith's price was fair. My dad used to put name stickers on my things. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar. I liked the sound, but I was not good at it. So, I played the electric guitar instead. It was the time of punk music, and you didn't have to play well to be a rock star. When I got my guitar back, I remembered my birthday in 1978. My parents gave me the guitar. It felt smaller than I remembered. I played it again. My fingers remembered the chords. Now, I want to play in a band. My son plays the saxophone. Maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people like me. We could call our band 'The Regainers'!'"
37,B2,"'People are talking a lot about sleep now. I wrote a book about people who cannot sleep well. Sleep is very important for our mind and body. People who cannot sleep know this best. It is good that sleep is getting attention. But what about dreams? We do not hear much about dreams. When we wake up early, we lose dreams. The last part of sleep is called REM, where we dream the most. Good sleepers spend a lot of time in REM. Dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep. They thought dreams help us understand our mind. But it is not that simple. Now, researchers look at the physical side of dreams. There is not much agreement on dreams. Dreams help us be creative. People like actors and writers use dreams more. Dreams help us think in new ways. For example, when people wake up from REM, they have more original ideas. Dreams help us think better. Creativity is not just for artists. We all need to think well in our lives. This is why we need to dream.'"
38,B2,"Susie Ray left London 20 years ago. She moved to a small town by the sea in south-west England. In her studio, you see empty frames and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a copyist artist. She paints copies of famous paintings. She can paint like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies look so real that art experts think they are the originals. The real paintings cost millions, but Susie's copies cost between a few hundred pounds and £12,000. Many people want her paintings. Some people pretend her copies are real. Susie puts her name on the back of her paintings. She does not want to break the law by selling fakes. Susie used to work as an illustrator for a garden. She did not earn much money, but it helped her learn. Now, she tells young artists to learn to draw well. Susie likes painting French impressionists like Manet and Degas. She says their art is hard to copy because it is both quick and careful. Susie does not paint her own art often. She tried once, but it looked like a photo. Susie is very careful and wants her work to be perfect."
39,B2,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea. She wanted to be the fastest sailor. As a child, she dreamed of sailing. Her boat was like a friend. She felt free on the ocean. On land, life felt boring. People asked her many questions about her races. She wanted to sail again soon.
Ellen raced alone around the world. She came second in a big race called the Vendée Globe. Her boat was called Kingfisher. She lived on the boat for 94 days. She showed me her small cabin. It was her home and work place. She planned everything carefully. She had freeze-dried food and a small gas stove. She took care of her boat because it was her world.
Ellen now thinks the world is like a boat. It is small and needs care. She went to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. She helped with a bird survey. She saw old whaling stations and thought about how people take too much from the world.
Ellen wants to save the planet. She says we must use less coal, oil, and gas. These things are running out. She talks about re-using things. She visits factories and talks to people about using less. She started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. It helps young people think about a better future.
Ellen misses sailing. She loved the adventure. But now, she wants to help the world. She says this work is more important than being the fastest sailor."

41,B2,"'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Many people know the names of pop groups, but not many know who Brahms was. I am studying music at university, but my classmates do not know much about classical music either. If you do not know the music, you probably do not have any recordings of it. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and classical music CDs do not sell many copies. This is surprising to me. Why do people not like classical music anymore? Some older people think TV and video games are the reason, but I do not agree. Classical music is not very interesting to most people, especially teenagers. Teenagers buy a lot of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who like classical music, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I am not a big fan of classical music. I like many types of music, but I do not listen to much classical music. Why do teenagers not like classical music? Classical music changes mood a lot, and teenagers like things fast. We also have trouble paying attention for a long time, and classical music is often long. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to. It also talks about things teenagers care about. In the past, families played music together at home, and people went to concerts to hear music. Now, we can find any music online, but we do not often listen to classical music. You do not hear classical music in shops. One of my teachers says more people go to classical concerts now, but not many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play in many places, but the audience is mostly older people. Teenagers often do not like what their parents like. Some people say schools are to blame, but many kids like playing classical music in school orchestras. They practice a lot, but when they relax, they listen to pop music.'"
42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mom's car and looked at Almonside School. ""I'll make you sorry I came here,"" she said to the school. Her mom didn't hear her. Bonnie's mom knew how she felt. Almonside School was strange, with many buildings hidden in the trees. Mrs. Wyndham saw signs: Science block, gym, riding center. ""Riding center,"" Bonnie said, interested. ""Headmaster's office,"" her mom said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mom on a path between trees. ""Walk next to me, not behind me,"" her mom said, tired. But Bonnie didn't walk next to her.
Soon, her mom talked to the headmaster in his office. Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I'll leave soon anyway,"" she thought. She left and went to the riding center. There was a nice building for horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She liked horses and treated them with respect. The horses looked well cared for. She walked and looked at each horse. ""I know what they're doing here,"" she told a small pony.
Then she saw a special horse. ""You're the best!"" she said. He was brown with some white. Bonnie liked lively horses. ""I feel like we met before,"" she said, petting him. ""In my dreams, I rode you in a big competition."" His name was Maverick. She wanted to ride him. ""Where can I find a bridle and saddle?"" she wondered. She found the room with riding gear unlocked. She put a saddle on Maverick and forgot about her mom and the headmaster.
When she sat on Maverick outside, she felt like a queen. Her old school called her Queen Bee, and she laughed. ""You're the best horse I've ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said. ""I know about horses."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, we can be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The ride was exciting, and the wind felt nice on her face. She knew Maverick trusted her, and she felt he would jump well."

44,B2,"I woke up and looked out my bedroom window. I saw the river and the ice. The ice was shiny in the sun. I worked hard last week with other people in the town. We put sandbags by the river to stop water from coming into the buildings. My back hurt from the work. I saw a boy on the ice. I did not know him. He was trying to walk on the ice. I put on my kayaking clothes. I have a special silver chain from my grandfather. He got it from South America. I keep it in my pocket. I also have his diary. I read it before I sleep. I went to the kitchen. ""Good morning, Rex,"" my mom said. I took a banana. ""You are up early,"" she said. ""Be careful."" ""Thanks, Mom,"" I said. I walked down the hall. I almost bumped into Grandpa. ""Watch where you’re going!"" he said. ""Where are you going?"" ""I’m going kayaking,"" I said. Grandpa was angry. He said, ""Why train? You didn’t win."" I took a deep breath. Grandpa went to the bathroom. Mom said, ""Don’t mind him."" I used to think Grandpa was a hero. He was in National Geographic magazine. I have my own trophies now. I want to be in the magazine too. Mom said, ""Have a good session, Rex."" I smiled and said, ""It will be warmer in South America."" I ate my banana and went outside to the boathouse."

Jess shook her head. ""I have never seen it before,"" she said. The painting showed a river. It was not a real river, maybe a dream river. The picture was strange but beautiful. There were no animals or people. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Grandpa never named his pictures. Mum turned the picture over. Jess read the words: ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she did not know why. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Yes, strange,"" Mum said. ""Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it."" ""Mum! You should not have asked."" ""I know, but it is an unusual picture. You can guess what he said."" Jess knew. Grandpa would say, ""A painting has its own life. We understand it or we don't. Artists should not explain their work."" Mum laughed. ""Something like that. I hoped you knew about this painting. You are like a muse for him."" ""Muse?"" Jess asked. ""Someone who inspires an artist,"" Mum said. Jess knew the word. Grandpa used it when she watched him paint. He said the muse was not kind to him or he needed to be nice to the muse. Jess thought a muse was a goddess, not a person. ""He does not need me to inspire him,"" Jess said. ""He has painted all his life."""
46,B2,"'This morning, I did not plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. It was not an accident, but it could have been. Maybe if I tripped with Dad's knife in my hand, the knife could have cut the carpet. I did not want to damage the carpet. I did not wake up thinking, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small, white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran kept ornaments in it. I keep shells and stones in it. I love the cabinet. But it is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It needs a corner. My bedroom has only two corners because it is small and shaped like cheese. The big bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the back one is my sister Angela’s; the one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the small one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But Angela is only fifteen, so I will be in my small room for a long time. I like my room. It is cosy, like a nest. The roof slopes down, and the window is at floor level. The problem is, there are not enough corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe is in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a little too tall. I thought, if I cannot cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut the carpet. It seemed like a good solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box’. That is what I was doing!'"
47,B2,"The story 'The Borrowers' is about a family of very small people. They live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from big people to live. I was asked to make a TV show of the story. It was hard because people love the book and have strong ideas about it. I used the book's drawings to help me. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' view, not the humans'. This made filming harder. The Borrowers are much smaller than humans. So, we had to film from far away to show their size. The crew had to film close to the ground to show the Borrowers' view. They wore out many jeans doing this! We never lifted the cameras high, except for special shots. It was hard to make the Borrowers look small with big things around them. We found a special way to do this. After the show, a famous director, George Lucas, called to ask how we did it. We built a set of the Borrowers' home with big objects to make the actors look small. It was fun. The actors had to carry big things like giant scissors. It made everyone laugh. There was a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. The actors had to go down a tunnel with water. It was scary for them. The costumes were important. They were made from heavy cloth like dolls' clothes. The lead actress couldn't bend or sit in her dress. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug. It was hot during filming, and the actors didn't like the costumes. We filmed the actors in front of a blue screen. They had to pretend things were there. I drew pictures to show how each scene should look. I made 2,000 drawings. We didn't have much money, so I worked at night. Once, I filmed a scene with no film in the camera! But in the end, the show was good and showed the magic of the books."

I look at my shoes. ‘Thanks,’ I say. The teacher calls my name, ‘Desert McGraw?’ ‘Here,’ I say. The teacher smiles and says her name is Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us papers about the class. Then she lets us talk to each other. ‘Why did you move here?’ the girl asks.

They have a lot of homework, tests, and activities. They also have jobs and chores at home. People sometimes think teenagers are lazy and only care about themselves. But this is not true for everyone. Teenagers use their phones a lot, but not just for fun. They use them to help with school and to stay in touch. Teenagers are busy all day. They start early in the morning and finish late at night. They do not get enough sleep. Many teenagers are tired at school. Some teenagers, like Lindamarie Olsen, use their free time to help others.

50,B2,"'The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. They have sent over fifty balloons high into the sky, about 35 km up. This is a science project and an adventure. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are going to release a balloon to try and see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space enters the earth's air, making a light. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the lunch box to help find it later. A gas tank fills the balloon, making it as big as a small car. An older boy drove a long way to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time to let the balloon go. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they say, and the balloon goes up. Some of them run and watch it with flashlights until it is gone. There is quiet and wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the clear sky. I see a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, it gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box come back to Earth safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS. Finding it is not easy, but it is fun. The lunch box usually lands far from people. ‘Finding the lunch box is a big part of the fun,’ says the group’s leader. They have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘We learn about the land this way,’ he says. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km from Bishop. The team had to drive around the mountains to get it. They had to decide if driving or walking was better. It could be hard if the lunch box was on a high mountain or in a tall tree. ‘These students know the Eastern Sierra well,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to them.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was on a rock in a waterfall. The camera did not record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but they could talk about why. And it was another adventure to share.'"
51,B2,"Chloe Morgan did not like science or Palaeontology when she was young. But when she was fifteen, she helped her brother with a school project about dinosaurs. She read an article about new dinosaur discoveries and found it very interesting. She decided she wanted to learn more about Palaeontology.
Chloe met a famous palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius. She was nervous, but he was friendly and answered her questions. This made her feel comfortable.
Chloe talks about how movies like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs, but they do not show what palaeontologists really do. In movies, palaeontologists are shown as strange or funny people, but in real life, they do many different things. Chloe digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, and writes for science magazines. She also likes to talk to people about science, especially young people, to help them understand it better.
Chloe helped with a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She made sure the dinosaurs looked real and were from the same time period. The show was popular with people of all ages because it showed dinosaurs in a new way.
Chloe thinks people like dinosaurs because they make us curious and remind us there is still more to learn about the world. Palaeontology is like traveling back in time to discover new things."
52,B2,"When you go on a car trip with your family, you might ask, ""Are we there yet?"" many times. But you know you are not there yet. When you get there, it is not ""there"" anymore. It is ""here."" So, you should ask, ""Are we here yet?""
Parents want to be ""there"" more than kids do. Kids can relax in the back seat. They can watch DVDs, listen to music, and do puzzles. Outside, you can see nice views from the window. In the front seat, mom or dad gives juice and cookies. They change the radio and make sure everything is okay.
Sometimes, my brother Tim bothers me. He puts his foot on my side. I put my foot on his side. Then we fight. Mom or dad stops the fight and tells Tim to stay in his seat. We calm down and look outside again.
Later, Tim blows air on me. He is not touching me, but it makes me mad. Mom or dad tells him to stop. We calm down again.
Dad has a funny way to answer ""Are we there yet?"" He says, ""Yes, we are here. Get out of the car."" But we are still on the road. So, we know we are not there yet.
You know you are ""there"" when mom and dad get out of the car and walk away from the kids. If they are still in the car, the answer is: no, you are not there yet."
53,B2,"John and Zuzi Morgan have a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi want people to have fun and come back again. Zuzi says they started the café because people use phones and gadgets too much. They want people to talk and play together, not just look at screens.
In their café, people play games called 'Eurogames'. These games have easy themes like farming. One famous game is Catan, where players build on an island and trade with each other. Everyone stays involved, and no one feels left out. Some games are 'co-operative', meaning everyone wins or loses together. One such game is Pandemic, where players solve problems as a team. Matt Leacock, a game designer, made Pandemic. He liked a game called Lord of the Rings and wanted to make a game that made people feel good, win or lose.
Matt loved games since he was a child. He used to feel sad when games were not fun, so he tried to make better games with his uncle. Pandemic became very popular. It tells a story, like a video game, where players change the world and rules as they play.
Video games helped board games become popular. Many people play games on their phones now. Ben Hogg, who works at a games company, says everyone plays games on their phones. Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, they play online, away from each other. Some people miss playing games with others in person.
John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun. In a world where people are often online, games help people connect in real life. This trend will continue."

55,B2,"Tony Connor is a new kind of famous person. He is very popular online, but many people do not know him. Tony rides a bike and does tricks. He jumps from high places like roofs and walls. People film his tricks and put them on the internet.
I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many boys and older people knew him and said he is a ""legend."" I watched him do tricks and saw he is very brave and creative. Before each trick, Tony tells me what he will do. Sometimes I do not believe he can do it, but he always does. When I say nice things to him, he does not seem very happy. Tony says he does not like being famous. He likes doing tricks more than talking to people.
Tony's fame comes from social media and cameras. He says this technology helps him make money. He thinks many people spend too much time with cameras and screens, but he is not upset. He makes a good living from his videos. 
Tony says to be good at sports, you need energy and to be strong when things go wrong. Even when Tony falls, he gets up and tries again. Some people think Tony takes too many risks, but he says they do not understand his sport. He listens to experts to stay safe.
Tony is careful about risks. He feels scared sometimes but finds a way to do the tricks. He plans a lot and makes sure he is ready before trying something new. Tony says if he is brave and focused, he can do the tricks well."
56,B1,"Helen Skelton is a TV presenter. She does hard things for charity. She ran in a desert and went down the Amazon river in a small boat. Her new challenge was walking on a high wire. The wire was 66 meters above the ground. It was between two towers of an old power station. She had no safety net. She wore a belt attached to another wire above her. She carried a long stick to help her balance. The stick was heavy, eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert. She found high-wire walking very hard. She trained every day. She ran up a hill and did exercises. She learned how to fall on the wire safely. Falling hurt, but she stayed positive. On the challenge day, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths and walked slowly. The walk was 150 meters and took 15 minutes. Helen said it was very scary. She was happy when it was over. Helen wants to do more charity work. She plans to go to the South Pole using skis, a kite, and a bike."
57,B1,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing. A penny farthing is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Jeff liked motor sports and worked with racing car engines. He saved money by riding an old bicycle to work. He also rode it to Amsterdam for a holiday. This trip made him want to see the world by bike. Jeff did not want a normal bike. He wanted to make his own bike. He thought a penny farthing was the craziest bike, so he went to a museum to learn how to make one. He tried to start his trip in 2001 and 2003, but he had to stop because of a knee injury. Finally, in 2006, he started his trip. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was seeing Mount Everest in Tibet. He met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he was happy with his penny farthing. People were amazed by his bike. The worst part of his trip was when he drank dirty water and got very sick. He was in bed for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. Even with these problems, Jeff says he would travel again on his penny farthing if he had the money."
58,B1,"I work at a university in the US. My team and I study water birds. We are learning about a bird called the American black duck. We use a special tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see ducks at night. We are worried because there are not many black ducks now. We do not know if they have enough food on the east coast. We know what they do in the day, but not at night. The new tool helps us see them clearly at night. We can learn more and help them better. 
Our work is hard. There are four people on my team. Each person works six hours every day. We study ducks in different places. I take a boat to some places and write notes about the ducks I see. The weather is not always good. Some nights are nice, but many nights are wet. It is very quiet, so I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake! We only missed one day of work because of deep snow. I like this work, even though it is hard. In the summer, we will work inside a lab. We will look at our results. It will be hard to stay inside, but it is important. I love my work and would not change it!"
59,B1,"'When I tell people about my job, they are surprised. But it's true! I work with chocolate every day. I taste chocolate to make sure it is good for our customers. Every week, I get small pieces of chocolate from our factory. I check how they taste, feel, and smell. I also taste things we put in the chocolate, like nuts and fruit. I choose the best ones. Next to my office, I have a kitchen. I make and taste chocolate there. I give some to my work friends too! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients. It is nice to have my own space. My job is different every day. Sometimes I am in the food lab. Other times, I travel to buy ingredients. I have a young family, so traveling can be hard. But I like the change and the chocolate! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, but I still love to eat it. I even eat more chocolate at home in the evening!'"
60,B1,"'Have you ever thought about what it’s like to be in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience. It is a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many things. You can learn to juggle, throw and catch balls, and even do tricks with fire. You can also learn trapeze, which is flying in the air. Students take a year-long course. They slowly learn to do more difficult tricks. Sometimes, parents come to watch. Sophia says circus performers need to do new things all the time. They must keep their shows exciting. To be good in the circus, you must practice a lot. You also make friends and learn from them. Being strong is important. Circus artists train every day like athletes. The best performers want to be successful, have new ideas, and always get better. Some people think you might get hurt or work only a little each year. But really, you need to think about the future. You can only travel with the circus when you are young. Later, you need other plans. The course also teaches business skills. Many students start businesses in different countries. They like to share their stories. Sophia says you don’t make a lot of money in the circus. The job does not have a regular salary. It is also competitive, but it is a lot of fun!'"
61,B1,"Mariam Hobson is a singer. She sings with other singers to help the main singer. You might not know her name or face, but you have heard her sing many times. Some people think these singers are not good enough to be the main singer, but that is not true. They are very good singers. Mariam loves her job because she sings many different types of music. She can sing classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes she sings for radio or ads. Once, she had to sing like a fish underwater! She never says no to a job. 
Mariam needs to be very good at music and learn fast. Sometimes there is no music to read. She remembers her first time singing for a movie. It was hard because eight people sang different tunes with an orchestra. She was scared because if she made a mistake, they had to start again. Recording takes a long time. 
Mariam likes to help songwriters. Some new songwriters do not know what is best for a female voice. When they hear her sing, they can make their songs better."

63,B1,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky liked to do many sports. She was good at swimming, and her coach thought she could be a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard to go there and do her schoolwork. 
When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special bike and started racing. Vicky thought it looked fun and tried it too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. She started cycling every day and did very well. The track was near her school, so she could train after school every day. Vicky became very good at cycling and won many races. When she was 28, she stopped racing. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning, but I got tired. When it’s not fun anymore, there’s no point.’ She then started a new job.
Vicky works for a charity called CycleZone. ‘We help young people who don’t like sports,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves. CycleZone is great because it brings young people together.’ The charity uses famous people to talk about their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people think celebrities only help to be more famous. But if famous people can help, I think they should.’"

Ana first sang in front of people at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher helped her off the stage. The teacher said she should join the school theatre club to feel more confident. After some time, Ana sang with 50 students at a school concert. 
A year later, Ana's brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in three days. She liked it so much that she joined a songwriting course. Ana was the youngest student, but she knew a lot about music. Her teacher did not listen to her ideas, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about this. She put the song online, and many people liked it. 
Joss Alton, who owns a music company called Isotope Music, came to see Ana. He asked her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was not sure because she did not know the company. Joss said she could sing what she wanted, so she joined. She sang at a concert in Dublin, and it was a big success.

65,B1,"Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat with a group along the west coast of Canada. My brother Harry had the idea. He is a journalist, like me, and wanted to write about the trip. Harry loves boats, but I do not. I wanted to visit this place because I saw it on TV when I was a child. Our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. I asked Harry if I could go with him, and he said yes! 
Before we left, there were storms, but the weather was good when we were there. I was busy with work, so I did not have time to plan. Harry said he took care of everything, so I did not worry. 
In Canada, we joined the group. We put our things in small boats and started the trip. The guide said not many people live on that coast. We only saw dolphins and birds on the first morning. There were islands far away, but we could not see them because of the fog. I watched the nice patterns our boat made in the water. 
We stopped to look at rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish. I did not know many of them. We did not worry about time. We made lunch and dinner together on campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it was very relaxing. 
When it was time to go home, I felt sad. I did not want to leave. But I missed my family and friends. I was excited to tell them about our adventures!"
66,B1,"My dad played basketball in Germany. His dad played too. I watched many of my dad's games when I was a kid. You might think I would love basketball, but I didn't. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, but I read books at the games instead of watching. 
When I started secondary school, I was very tall. My sports teacher asked if I wanted to play basketball. I liked the practice, but I thought I needed to get better before playing a real game. The teacher believed in me, so I played a game against another school. My mum and dad watched, and I was nervous, but it was OK!
For four years, I practiced every day and got better. I joined an adult team and then moved to the USA for a special sports school when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic players. It was great to work with him, but I missed my parents. I didn't see my friends much at home because of training, so that was the same. I got used to my new life, and my English got better too!
I became a professional player at eighteen. I was taller than most players, but I needed to get stronger. My coach knew a team for me, so I joined them while I was still in college. I am happy I did."
67,B1,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and found out I liked it a lot. I saw my city in a new way, like the tourists did. After college, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide. I learned I needed a licence and had to know a lot about Chicago. I studied hard and got my tour guide qualification. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You need to be fun and tell good stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy the tour, so I make sure they are happy. Good reviews online are important because they bring more customers. I work hard to make my tours fun, and people often recommend my tours to others."
68,B1,"My name is Ella. I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Josie is five years younger than me. We went to help at a place for elephants. This place helps sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would like the other people there. They were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this. But it was okay in the end.
Our job was to get food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants. This took most of the day. Josie thought it was hard work, but I liked seeing the elephants happy. We also washed the elephants in the river. We used big brushes and soap. It was fun, even if I got very wet!
In the evening, we took the elephants to the forest. They stayed there at night. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a room. It was small, but Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot at night, but we knew it would be. The food was very good. It did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, we talked and played games.
Now we are back in the UK. Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks, she says she loved it. I think she missed her friends too much. But she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day. I want to go back for sure!"
69,B1,"My name is Gina D’Costa. I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many people. Some people buy flowers for friends or their homes. Hotels and offices also buy flowers. Sometimes, we give flowers for business photos. One time, I put flowers in a castle for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was happy with it.
I start my day at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are sleeping then. My friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is cold and dark, but I do not mind. The flower market is amazing. There are flowers from all over the world. I like pink flowers the most, but I buy many colors for my customers. Not all flowers are there all year.
I do not like talking about prices with sellers, but I have to. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get a good price. At the shop, we look at what customers want. We make flower bunches and check prices. Sometimes, customers think flowers cost too much. I help them choose flowers they can afford. I enjoy making nice flower bunches for people. I love my job!"
70,B1,"My city has a modern cinema. It shows new films and films for kids on weekends. The cinema is close to my home. But I wanted to talk about films with people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends. We do not use a cinema to show films. We pick a new place in the city every month. Once, we showed a film in an old factory. It was very cold, like the place in the film. Some places are free because they sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep ticket prices low. We do not want to make money, just cover our costs. Each time we show a film, it gets easier. We have our own equipment now. We sell tickets online, so we know how many people are coming. It is nice when people say they had a great time. Our website helps us talk to other film clubs. We visit them to see how they do things. We also have a blog because people look online for film news. We put posters in cafés too. But the best way is when people tell their friends about us. We also have fun activities with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz, and everyone liked it."
71,B1,"'When I was a child, I loved taking photos. At 15, I wanted to do something special with my hobby. I decided to take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers did this, and I thought it was a great idea. I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to show my photos to other people. I was happy when people liked my photos. I took photos of many things. Someone said my photos would be better if they had a common idea. I agreed and started taking photos of nature, like birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white. Other young photographers took color photos. Sometimes I felt unsure about my project and almost stopped. But I trusted myself and felt better about my style. I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a photography competition for people my age. I entered my photos for fun. I was so happy when I won first prize. It was the first time I thought my photography was good. Now, I have my own photography studio and I am happy with my career choice.'"
72,B1,"'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn new skills like speaking in front of people. In NYC, you can do many activities and learn new things. There are different levels, from easy to hard. Adults called 'leaders' help you. When you finish a level, you get a certificate. My leader asked me to help at a children's club for two hours a week. I was not sure because I went to that club when I was eight and it was hard to make friends. I was shy and stopped going. But I wanted the NYC certificate, so I tried. Soon, I liked going to the club a lot. It was more than just getting a certificate. I made good friends with the children. Now, I go for four hours a week and I am happy to go. I learned a lot at the club. Now, I want to be a youth worker, someone who helps children, after I finish school in three years. I never thought about this job before. NYC helped me improve my speaking skills and help others. I have more NYC certificates now, and one is for camping!'"
73,B1,"I was born in Denver, USA. When I was eight, my dad took me to the mountains to try snowboarding. At first, I was scared because the hill was very steep. But my dad helped me, and I tried it. I liked snowboarding a lot and got better at it. When I was ten, I started going to competitions. I love snowboarding and winning makes me happy. Sometimes, I don't plan my moves, and it works well. Once, I got a perfect score in a competition. This made me trust myself more. In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I also spend time with my friends. I think about my future a lot. I love snowboarding, but I might want to be a doctor too. I know I can't snowboard forever, so I want to have other options."
74,B1,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I did not know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could have it if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work and save money. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I did not like it. My parents said I could start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I tried it too. It was easier than I thought. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. I made jewellery and sold it to my friends and family. They said they liked it, but I was not sure. I wanted to know if other people liked it too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery. Soon, people from all over the country wanted to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum. I knew it could work, so I made a website. Now, I make a lot of money from my business online, and we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun."
75,B1,"Janine Stuart is a young girl. She is 13 years old. She wrote a book called Being Amelia. The book is very popular. Being Amelia is a little bit about Janine's life. Janine's father has a job that makes the family move a lot. So, Janine knows how to make new friends. This helped her write about Amelia, the main character, who goes to a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia's life at home and her brother. Janine does not have a brother, so she used her imagination.
Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored. Her mother wanted to be a writer, and her teachers told her to write, so Janine decided to write. Before this, Janine won a short story competition. This made the publishing company interested in her book. They liked it, and soon, the book was in stores.
A review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover has happy teenagers, the story is about people with problems. This makes the story real. The reviewer thinks Janine is a good writer, even better than some famous writers. Janine is still getting used to being famous. At first, she was shy when people knew her on the street. Now, she is okay with it. Janine wants to help other young writers. She says they need to find what works for them. For her, spending time with friends gives her ideas to write about."
76,B1,"Hi, I'm Tom. I am 15 years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad got a job as the castle's manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings. At first, we were not sure about moving. We thought the castle might not be as nice as our home, and there was no school on the island. But after we moved, we liked living on the island. The castle is not very pretty, but our home inside is nice. In summer, many people visit the island, and there are beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families on the island. There are not many teenagers, but the adults help each other with work. I travel by boat to my old school every day. I like the big waves, but the boats do not go when it is stormy. If I miss the bus after school, I miss the last boat home. So, I tell my friends to hurry when they visit. We see beautiful views, like the sunset over the sea. Sometimes it is foggy, then sunny again. We have big storms, but the castle is strong. It has been here for a long time."
77,B1,"I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds there. My parents taught me how to see different kinds of birds and where to find them. It was fun! When I came home, I joined a birdwatchers' club for young people. I want to see 200 different birds. I have seen many birds on family holidays in other countries. We look for places with birdwatching activities. I have been to Egypt and South America. I hoped to see my 200th bird in South America, but I did not. I learned to be patient. I made a video about my birdwatching challenge. Many teenagers liked it. My teachers saw it and asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was nervous, but I did it. The teachers said I did well. I might do another talk next year. I am happy to live in the countryside. I know teenagers in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds in green areas. Birdwatching clubs should help more young people enjoy this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, and it is not expensive."
78,B1,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved playing football, and soon I was not a bad player. My family thought I would stop playing, like with other hobbies, but I did not stop. I dreamed of playing football when I grew up. 
One day, I played in a local game, and a referee saw me. He thought I was a good player and told a manager of a professional women’s club about me. The manager watched me play and asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I did not know young girls could join women’s clubs. I started training with the club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at football. 
Some people did not think I would be a star player, and this made me a little sad. But my coach told me to believe in myself. He let me play in a big match. I ran very hard because I did not want to lose. By luck, I scored the winning goal. I heard my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around. It was fantastic! 
Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. We want teenagers to like football and talk to other players in my club. They can see what it is like to play for a top team. My advice to them is the same as my coach’s advice to me: you will have good times and bad times. I have had very few bad times, so I am lucky!"
79,C2,"In the UK and other countries, schools and universities want students to start doing research early. Research is not just for famous scientists or big universities. It helps us learn and think better. Research skills are good for school and work. When you do research, you ask questions like ""Why?"" and ""How?"" You don't just remember facts; you make new ideas. Research can be big and important or small and everyday. Even when you plan a holiday or fix things at home, you are doing research. In college, you need to ask questions and think about what you learn. In some places, people think you should not question teachers or books. But in the UK, US, and other places, it is good to ask questions. This can be hard, but it is important. We need to think carefully about what we read and hear. We should not just believe everything. We need to check if it makes sense and has proof."
80,C2,"Cities are places where people think and create new ideas. In the past, people in London talked about science and politics in coffee houses. In Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafés. But living in a city is not always easy. The same places that help people talk and think can also make them sick. For example, people in London got sick from cholera in coffee houses. Picasso moved to the countryside because city life was hard.
Scientists now study how cities affect our brains. They find that cities can make us tired and think less clearly. One reason is that cities have little nature. Nature is good for our brains. For example, people in hospitals get better faster when they see trees. Nature gives our brains a break from the busy city.
Most people now live in cities, not in open spaces. Cities are full of people and buildings. This can be bad for our health and how we think. In a city, our brains work hard to pay attention to many things, like people and traffic. This makes us tired. Nature, on the other hand, is easy for our brains. It helps us relax and feel better.
Some people, like philosophers and park designers, knew this a long time ago. They made parks in cities, like Central Park in New York, to help people feel better. A walk in a park can make our brains work better.
Even though city life is hard, cities are still places where people create new ideas. Busy streets and many people help with new ideas and inventions. For example, crowded London in the past and Cambridge, Massachusetts today are places with many new ideas.
The challenge is to make city life better for our brains while keeping the good things about cities. Sometimes, people want to leave nature and go back to the city for new ideas and excitement."
81,C2,"'Where is the mind? We might think the mind is in our heads. Today, we have machines that show us the brain. But I think the mind is not just in the head. Many things, like tools and writing, help us think. In history, people used stones, clay, and other things to help their minds. I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It says that things outside our body help our mind. For example, a blind person uses a stick to feel. The stick becomes part of their body. This shows that our mind can change and grow with new tools. Our mind is always changing. From old stone tools to the internet, these things help us learn and understand the world. Humans use tools to know more. This is why we make things, and these things help make our minds. I call this metaplasticity. Our minds change when we use things. MET helps us see how tools, from old to new, change how we think. Humans have used tools to change their minds for a long time.'"
82,C1,"Photography is a very important invention. It changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of life. People used it for work, science, art, and fun. Many people think photography is America's best gift to art. 
Photography started in the mid-19th century. It was popular because it was a new technology. People liked new things like trains and electricity. Photography made it easy to see the world. 
Cameras helped people show who they are. They could take pictures of themselves and their families. These pictures were like a family record. 
Photos look real. They show everyday life. A photo tells us to look at something. It is a record of what was in front of the camera. But, the person taking the photo also adds their own view. 
Photos can be seen in many places like newspapers, magazines, or galleries. Each place can change what the photo means. 
Artists use photos in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photos in his art. Photos are now a big part of art. They help us understand pictures better."
83,C1,"In 1890, William James, an American thinker and doctor, said psychology is the ""science of mental life."" This means studying how we think and feel. Everyone has thoughts and feelings, so we all know a little about this. We can study these ideas in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is not always easy to understand.
William James was interested in human psychology. He thought it had three main parts: thoughts and feelings, the world around us, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is personal and comes from our own thoughts and experiences. Sometimes, we think we know why people do things, like feeling sad or quitting a job. But people can see things differently.
Psychologists try to find out which ideas are true. They help us know the difference between our own thoughts and scientific facts. Psychology is about the mind, but we do not know everything about the brain. Psychologists learn by watching how people act and making guesses about what is happening inside.
Studying psychology is like solving a puzzle. We look at clues from how people behave. These clues must be carefully watched and studied. Psychology wants to describe, understand, and help change how people think and act. It helps in many areas, like teaching children to read or helping people talk about their feelings.
People have talked about psychology for a long time, but it has been studied scientifically for about 150 years. Early psychologists looked at their own thoughts to find answers. But this method has limits. Today, psychologists prefer to watch how people behave to learn more."
84,C1,"In Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. It is in a business park. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. For example, there is A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. These products did not sell well, so they were taken off the market. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry is the person who takes care of the museum. She thinks each product has a sad story. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who worked in marketing, wanted to collect new products. He did not plan to collect failed products, but most products do not succeed. So, his collection became mostly products that failed. Many people like to think positively. They believe if they imagine good things, good things will happen. But sometimes, thinking too positively can make people less motivated to work hard. Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that people who think too much about success often do not achieve their goals. Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, says people have different beliefs about ability. Some people think ability is natural and fixed. Others think it can grow with hard work. People who believe in hard work see failure as a chance to learn and get better. This way of thinking can make people happier."
85,C1,"Sports teams often play better at home. But why? People have different ideas. Sports are changing, and we are learning new things. Science and money are two big reasons why we question old ideas about home advantage. Scientists study how players do their best. They have many ideas about why playing at home helps. People who pay players want to know if home advantage is important. They think players should play well anywhere if they get paid enough.
Fans are important too. They think their support helps the team win. When fans cheer, they remember the team scoring a goal. But they forget the times when cheering did not help. Science shows that fans can affect referees. In one study, referees watched a game with and without crowd noise. Referees with noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees feel pressure from the crowd.
Home advantage is not as strong as before. In the past, home teams won more often. Travel is easier now, and stadiums are similar. But home advantage is still different in each sport. Basketball teams do best at home, then football teams. Baseball teams have the least home advantage. This might be because baseball is more about one-on-one play, like batter vs. pitcher.
Playing at home can make players feel more confident. They know the place and feel good with their team. Also, players have more energy at home. Their bodies react as if they are defending their home. This was seen in the Rugby World Cup, where home teams won against stronger teams. It shows that playing at home can be a big help."
86,C1,"""A famous golfer, Gary Player, once said, 'The more I practise, the luckier I get.' This means that practising a lot makes you better. People talk about whether talent is something you are born with or something you learn. Many people think practice is more important than talent. A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said you need 10,000 hours of practice to be an expert. Books like 'Outliers' and 'Talent Is Overrated' agree with this idea. But a writer named Epstein says it's not just about practice. He thinks both talent and practice are important. Epstein traveled to many places to learn more. He found that sometimes genes, or what you are born with, also matter. For example, in a dog race in Alaska, the dogs' natural drive is important. Epstein says both nature (what you are born with) and nurture (how you are raised) are important for athletes. He also talks about why men and women compete separately in sports. This shows that the topic is complex."""
87,C1,"'A new report says many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her book, Kith, she says children stay inside too much, watching TV or using computers. They do not play outside in nature, like in the woods or by rivers. This is a big problem, she thinks. Many children say they would be happier if they could play outside more. People over 40 remember their childhoods, playing outside and having fun. They think it was better than how children live now. But these adults also keep their own children inside because they worry about safety. Griffiths talks about how parents' fears help toy companies sell more gadgets. She also talks about giving medicine to children who are restless or making them wear goggles for games. Griffiths thinks children should have more freedom to play and take small risks. She says children learn from small accidents. But she does not say how to make sure these accidents are safe. Also, not all children want to play outside. Some like to stay inside. Maybe the real problem is making all children do the same thing, whether staying inside or going outside.'"
88,C1,"I am a scientist who studies how the brain works. I went to school for a long time. I am good at solving problems, but not because of school. Most problems need life experience to solve. For children, this experience comes from playing. My research is about how play helps children grow. All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that need to learn more, play more. For example, animals that hunt play more than animals that eat plants. Children play a lot because they have a lot to learn. Play helps children learn important skills. These skills are not taught in school. They learn to think creatively, work with others, and control their feelings. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can solve new problems. Creative people often play. Albert Einstein, a famous scientist, said school almost made him lose interest in math and science. He got his ideas by playing with thoughts. We can't teach creativity, but school can sometimes stop it. It is important to get along with others and work together. Children learn this by playing with other children. Play is something children choose to do. They can stop if they want. This makes play fair. School has become harder. There is less time to play, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Outside school, adults control sports and play. This is different from before when children played freely. These changes happened slowly but are big. They happened because of parents' worries and other reasons. Children need more play, not more school. We should let children play and explore. This will help them grow strong for the future."
89,C1,"In many countries, young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them talk directly to employers. This is different from the past when people had to stand outside offices with signs saying ""hire me."" But using social media can be tricky. 
For example, a young person in the US tried to contact a marketing executive on LinkedIn. He wanted her help to find a job because she knew many important people. But she was not happy. She did not want to share her contacts with someone she did not know. She sent him a mean message, and many people saw it online. This made people think about how to use social media for work.
Social media can be dangerous if you do not know how to use it for jobs. Many young people make mistakes. They use social media for fun, like on Facebook and Twitter, but using it for work is different. When we were teenagers, social media was for fun and showing off. But for work, we need to be serious and careful.
Employers say young people can be too friendly and seem arrogant on professional sites. This makes it hard for them to get jobs. Young people need to show they have the skills and are ready to work.
To contact someone on a professional site, say who you are and what you can offer. Do not send the same message to everyone. Be polite and humble. Social media can help you find jobs, but you need to use it carefully."
90,C1,"'It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, fewer people in the UK buy newspapers. In the USA, only 26% of people get news from newspapers now, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people say newspapers will disappear in 15 years. But old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here. Theatre, radio, and cinema have all survived new media like TV and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again. Newspapers were once new too. They became popular in the 19th century with new technology like the steam press and telegraph. People started to want news regularly. In the past, people did not expect change. They only noticed seasons and big events like floods or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. Before that, people did not need news every day. Newspapers have a set format and schedule, which can be limiting. Online news is different. People can read news anytime and choose what they want to know. Online news can update quickly and correct mistakes fast. There is no limit to how much can be written. But online news often focuses on being first and getting many comments, which can cause confusion. In the past, news was shared in busy places like markets, where truth mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand the world better in the future.'"
91,C1,"'Humans are not like animals that see well at night. We need sunlight to see. Our eyes are made for the day. But we have made the night bright with lights. This is called light pollution. Light pollution happens when lights shine up into the sky instead of down to the ground. This makes the night too bright. It changes how animals live. Birds can get confused and fly into buildings. Some birds sing at night because of the lights. Light pollution also affects people. We need darkness to sleep well. Too much light can make us sick. Long ago, cities were dark at night. People used candles and lanterns. Now, cities are very bright. This makes it hard to see the stars. We forget how big the universe is. We need to remember the night and the stars. They are important for us and for animals.'"
92,C1,"A big company said it will not count how many days off workers take. This idea came from another company that did the same thing. The boss of the big company got the idea from an email from his daughter. The big company has 50,000 workers and does many things like finance, transport, and healthcare. The other company has 2,000 workers and does one thing. 
The boss said workers can take as many days off as they want if they are sure their work is done and it won't hurt the company. But is this possible? When you take a holiday, work piles up. This can make workers feel guilty and stressed. If workers feel bad about taking time off, they might not take any. This can make them less happy and less productive.
In some companies, people work late and might not take holidays even if they can. If workers think they will look lazy for taking time off, they might not take it. 
Technology makes it hard to know when work stops and free time starts. The other company started this policy because workers asked how to balance work and time off. But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Workers might feel like they are always being watched.
Workers need time off for their health. Time off helps them feel better and work better. I am not sure if this new policy will really let workers take more holidays."
93,C1,"'Journal-based peer review is when experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This helps make sure the research is good. It can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Some people think this is good because it makes the research trustworthy. Others think it takes too long. 
Now, there is a new way called preprints. Preprints are papers shared online before experts check them. This helps scientists share new ideas quickly. People can read and talk about these papers. 
Publishing in famous journals is important for scientists' careers. But sometimes, this makes scientists rush and not show all their data. Reviewers also decide if a paper is good for the journal, not just if it is good science. 
Preprints can help because they let everyone see and talk about the research. Scientists can still publish in journals later. Preprints are not checked by experts first, but many people can read and comment on them. 
Preprints help share science with more people. They also let scientists share results that are not new discoveries. This is important for science. Preprints make it easier for scientists to work together and focus on the research, not just where it is published.'"
94,C1,"'When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it is like a ""painting in words."" Their answers do not satisfy me. One day, I asked them to choose an object and write about it in two ways. First, like a scientist, and second, as if the object could talk. They called the second part ""Poem."" One student wrote: Poem I may look strange, but I help people breathe. I am used in emergencies for a short time. Most people never use me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class see how poetry is special. The exercise was fun and led to good talks. When I was in school, poetry was hard for me. I thought poems were puzzles that stopped me from understanding. After school, many people read fewer poems. Sometimes, you see a poem and it dares you to read it. Often, it is hard to understand. But you feel good for trying. What do we want from poems? Are they for deep feelings, beautiful pictures, or smart jokes? Maybe. But for tears, we watch movies. For news, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings are nice to look at, and music is a mix of words and sounds. But poems can be unclear, like life. This does not tell us what a poem is. If you search online, it says poetry is art with rhythm and sound. But the word ""poem"" comes from Greek, meaning ""a thing made."" Poets make things. So, what kind of thing is a poem? Some say poems are like wild animals or machines. But these ideas are not perfect. Talking about poems helps us think in new ways. Poems can stick in our minds, like songs. Words and music are powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. Words can be strong, like sticks and stones. A poem in a newspaper or magazine can be powerful. It uses space that could be for something else. A poem is made by writing and rewriting, like stories or articles. But it is not made to sell. Poems are special and can surprise us.'"
95,B2,"I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money. My wife, Marion, was happy when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. I like finding old things because it makes me feel connected to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 
One rainy February afternoon, I had some free time. I went to a place with old farming tools. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug in the mud and found a round, golden ball. I thought it might be something special. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous necklace from over 2,000 years ago, in the British Museum. 
I took it home and showed Marion. We didn't try it on because it was too precious. I hid it in our house because I was worried. The law says I must tell the authorities about such finds in 14 days. I showed it to a friend in the hospital and then took it to the council office. They checked it and sold it to the local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. 
The money from the sale, £350,000, was shared between the field owner and me. But the torc is more than just money. It is something I saved for everyone to see. People ask if I will stop using my metal detector now. But I still enjoy finding brooches and coins. Like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I keep looking for more treasures."
96,B2,"'I love sleeping when I travel, but I don't talk about it much. My friends plan their trips with many activities like visiting museums and hiking. I smile and listen, but I don't say much. They might be surprised to know that I plan time for naps and lazy mornings on my trips. Sleeping well is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast, I slept a lot, more than 12 hours a day. There were noisy birds, but I still slept well. Being away from home, I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams. Without alarm clocks and work, sleep comes easily. I think sleep is part of the travel experience. When we travel, we see and hear new things. We sleep to process all this new information. That's why sleep feels different when we travel. Sleep changes in different places. People talk about jet lag, but I think it's more about getting used to new places. In Trinidad, people wake up early and rest when it's hot. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me time to get used to their sleep pattern. When I do, I feel like I am really there. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with friends. After eating, we all took naps. I learned about the siesta, a rest after lunch. It was a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. In new places, I enjoy the different smells and sounds while I sleep. Slow travel means enjoying every moment, and sleep is a part of that. Maybe I should tell my friends that sleeping is an important part of my travel too.'"
97,B2,"The woman looked away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest."" Mia picked up a hat with a soft gauze and a silk bow. ""I think this one looks best on you,"" she said nicely.

She touched the small hat on her head. ""Yes, this is the one I want."" Mia smiled and agreed. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's 30th birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was happy to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. Jen was bringing a friend named Tattie. Mia's husband, Jeff, did not like the name. ""What kind of name is Tattie?"" he asked. ""It’s short for Tatiana,"" Mia said. ""I think it’s nice."" Jeff did not like fancy things. He always told Mia she was too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she picked the wrong hat. He might have said a trash can lid would look better. ""You are too polite, Mia,"" he often said. An hour later, Mia closed her shop and went home. Her shop was next to her house. Four years ago, when their son Luke left home, Mia had an idea. She turned the barn next to their house into a shop. Jeff was not sure it would work. ""Do people really want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew people wanted hats for special events. She was right. Her shop, Mia’s Hats, was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. They tried on many hats to find the right one. Mia also sold handbags and jewelry now."

I saw mountains, streams, and forests. My neighbor woke up and smiled. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said. His name was Sergei. He was from Moscow. He was going to sell clothes to miners. His English was not good. My Russian was not good. We used a dictionary to talk. I told him I was going to Magadan in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket. I wanted to go back to England by bicycle.

100,B2,"'In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots fly fast planes. They go through tall pylons, turn quickly, and do tricks in the air. The planes can go up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to try it. Before the flight, I signed two papers. One said I was healthy. The other said I had to empty my pockets. Small things can be dangerous in the plane. I learned to look at the horizon to know where I am. The pilot told me to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. Before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started, I was nervous. I tried not to touch the pedals or switches. The pilot, Dario, and I were in a fast plane. We took off and turned right quickly. I felt the air push on me. I looked at the horizon and tried to stay calm. We flew close to the ground and between pylons. It was very fast. I got to fly the plane for two minutes. My hand shook a lot. Then Dario did a barrel roll, a full turn. He asked if I was okay. I said yes, but I was scared. Then he did a loop, a big circle in the air. Some people like this, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, I looked up and saw fields. The flight was 10 minutes long. It was easier than what the pilots do in a race. After we landed, Dario ate sandwiches. I did not eat for hours. That night, I dreamed about flying in circles.'"
101,B2,"Doug Allan makes movies of wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature movie, he probably filmed them. He likes it when the temperature is -18C. Allan learned about the sea and diving. He loved diving and learned how to live in cold places. His big chance came when a TV team came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to make a wildlife movie. He helped the team and found out he loved being a wildlife cameraman. He likes travel, adventure, and being underwater. Now, he is a top cameraman and works on many big TV wildlife shows. 
When Allan started, not many people went to Antarctica. There were people who liked coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. Allan became the ""cold man."" He filmed amazing things in cold places. The cameras were simple when he started 35 years ago. Now, it is easier to film. Before, you had to remember what you filmed. Now, with digital cameras, you can see it right away. Film was expensive, so you filmed less. Now, you can film a lot.
Allan is good at working in cold places. He feels comfortable on sea ice. He says there are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes in cold places. Filming wildlife is fun but also hard. Once, he went to the Orkneys to film birds but could not find the right ones. 
Allan went to Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, to film polar bears. It is very cold and windy there. He walked for many hours and watched polar bear homes for 23 days. He only saw one mother bear and her baby. On day 24, he saw a bear come out of a hole in the snow. He was very happy to see it. The bear slid down the snow, and two baby bears came out too. It was like a show, and Allan had the best seat.
Now, Allan wants to make a movie about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to people who live there and see how it affects them. He thinks he can make a great movie."

Now, he is back in the Arctic for a new trip. This trip is very important. Pen and two friends will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice. No one has done this before. The information will help scientists understand global warming. 
Pen was ready for this job. When he was a child, a woman who worked for a famous explorer took care of him. She made him strong by sending him outside in the cold with little clothing. His father loved cold adventures, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and the outdoors. She helps with his polar guide business. Mary says Pen is in more danger when he drives at home because he thinks about the Arctic. 
Pen and Mary have two children. Pen finds it hard to leave them. Last time, he told his son to take care of the family, which was too much for him. This time, Pen will not call them much from the Arctic. He is getting ready for the trip. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer, will go with him. A team of six will bring supplies. 
Pen is worried because he is almost 47 and has not trained enough. He thinks this trip is important for science. Before, going to the North Pole was just for him. Now, it will help scientists learn about the Arctic Ocean. Pen says their skills are important now."
103,B2,"I took a year off. What would I do? Being an Olympian is special. I could write, work on TV, and talk to schools and businesses. But I wanted something to compete in. I wanted to stay fit for the Olympics. So, I ran marathons and did triathlons. But I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's question: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed it. I talked to my rowing friends about the race, but they were not interested. I wanted to win if I joined. Would Ben help me win? Maybe not. But being the underdog sounded fun. Ben was ready for the race and had money for the entry and boat. We talked about the costs. The boat and equipment cost £70,000. It was a lot of money. I also thought about losing money from not working. Speaking at business events pays well. People like to hear my stories. But I wanted a new goal. Rowing the Atlantic would be a new story. I learned a lot while planning. Being an athlete was hard but simple. I trained every day with help from doctors and dieticians. I worried people would think I just wanted to be on TV with Ben. But I learned the race is more about the mind. Ben did many hard things before, but he couldn't row well. I was surprised. I needed to be more patient. But I knew he needed to improve a lot. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,B2,"'A year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 and wanted a change from busy London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They let me work as a husky dog handler for the winter. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides with huskies. The company started with six dogs and now has more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm' with no running water. They told me the work is hard and the hours are long. I packed my bags quickly. November 6, London On my flight, I tried to learn the names of over 100 huskies but felt nervous. I looked out the window instead. I thought about how winter was coming. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus ride north was exciting. We drove through snowy forests and saw reindeer. I arrived at the farm at night and was given boots to go outside. Anna asked if I was ready for hard work. I followed the barking dogs and saw people getting the huskies ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited. I joined them and we went into the dark with only a light on my head. November 15, Hetta I quickly learned to be a husky guide. Anna asked if I was useful. I didn’t know. I had never driven a snowmobile or chopped wood. But I had a driving license. I learned the basics of dog-sledding: lean in corners, use the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. Feeding the dogs was hard because water freezes quickly. We made a 'soup' of meat and hot water for them. After my first week, I was tired but happy. I emailed my friends, 'I can chop wood, hammer nails, and use a saw in the snow.'"
105,B2,"On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and finished the race. The news people were very surprised by her run. Her time was so good that she could run in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Reporters asked her about emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman told her to use it after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she didn't really understand how big her achievement was at the time. She and her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent was worried she was running too fast and might not finish the race. Hartmann was angry about this but understood why someone might think it was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe thought she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She ran the last part very fast in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the end, she thought she could run even faster. The race director, Dave Bedford, was surprised by her time. Radcliffe thought she could do it again next year, but she couldn't. After the race, people wanted to know how she ran so well. Hartmann helped her a lot with her training. He said she could handle a lot of pain. He traveled a long way to help her and worked very hard. Other athletes were upset because he spent so much time with her. Radcliffe trained very hard, but she thinks others are more talented. She thought Mary Keitany might beat her record. Radcliffe always pushed herself to run hard, even when she was winning. That marathon was her best race. She never ran that fast again, but she inspired many women to start running long distances."
106,B2,"'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, started, I did not know if people would like it. At that time, people talked a lot about new food ideas in Britain. I thought our show was new and different, but I was still worried. Would people like a show about cooking that also talked about history and science? I watched the first show feeling happy and scared. I did not need to worry. The show was a big success. It helped me do other interesting projects, like writing a book about my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey. I wrote more books called ‘Perfection’, each with its own TV show. In these, I traveled a lot to meet amazing people, like a man who makes special pasta. These people work hard to make perfect food. But what is perfect is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to show was hard. I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But we made a list that had something for everyone. I think everyone has their own idea of perfect food, based on feelings and memories. I did not say my recipes were the best. But I used my skills and talked to many people to find out what makes these dishes good. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means trying and changing things to make them better. The TV show let me see new foods and places. I was excited to learn about food memories because I started my career this way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had many adventures, like going to a factory with the wrong tomatoes and visiting a farm that was not good enough. I tried many ways to make each recipe better. I even milked a cow by hand and used dry ice to make ice cream. I cooked chicken in a hospital machine and almost burned my house making pizza!'"
107,B2,"'We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and stopped in a field. John got out and looked at the engine. He said, ‘I don’t know what I’m doing,’ and he and Mum laughed. Bea was worried. ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field was big with grass and flowers. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I said. We got back into the van and waited. John went to find help. Mum lay on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay next to her. I told them about two birds I heard in London. They talked about food and the weather. Bea said, ‘That’s silly, no one understands birds.’ I said, ‘I do.’ But I wasn’t sure. Mum was asleep. John came back with three boys. They helped push the van to a hotel. Bea stayed in the van. The boys waved at her. We went to a café near the road. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John said. ‘It might be expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have tea,’ Mum said. The tea was sweet with mint. Mum said, ‘It’s like syrup.’ We stayed all day. John looked at the engine. ‘It’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said. Mum made beds outside. It was nice to sleep on the ground. ‘I’ll have to tow us to Marrakech,’ John said. Later, we sat in a truck. Our van was behind us. Bea sat in the front with the driver. I thought about how we’d get home. Maybe we could take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep.'"
108,B2,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel. She talked to two other pianists. One was a man from Tokyo, and the other was a woman from Europe. Lucy didn't hear the woman's name clearly. They were not in the competition like Lucy. They were older than Lucy, about ten years older. They spoke English well and talked about music and travel.
Lucy said, ""I think I'm going to Tanglewood this summer."" It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She didn't want to do many things, like concerts and competitions. These made her miss a lot of school. She studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco instead. Lucy didn't even want to come to the Prague Festival. Her mom sent in the application for her. Lucy's dad gave her a necklace to say ""well done,"" and her brother Gus dreamed of going to the festival too. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her to dinner to plan her music.
The man from Tokyo asked, ""Tanglewood?"" Lucy said, ""Yes."" He asked, ""How old are you?"" Lucy said, ""Fifteen."" The woman said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't want to show off. She just wanted to fit in.
The woman left, but the man stayed. He asked, ""Have you been to Japan?"" Lucy said, ""Once, when I was eight."" Then Lucy's grandfather came and took her to meet other people. He said, ""Don't get too friendly with the competition."" Lucy said, ""They're not the competition."" Her grandfather said, ""Everyone is the competition.""
After the party, in the elevator, her grandfather said, ""You did well, Lucy. I'm proud of you. People know who you are."" Lucy liked being important, even if some people were jealous. At school, her friends didn't care about her music. But at the festival, she felt special."
109,B2,"Dad said, ""It's not good to spend too much time online. You need to go outside."" I wanted to know what experts say about this. They say using social media is normal for teenagers. We have many real-life friends and learn important skills for the digital world. Simon Miles, an expert, says social media is part of growing up now. Teenagers use it a lot, not just for buying things or checking emails like adults. It's important how we use it.
Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says social media is like a youth club for teenagers today. It helps us make friends and learn about ourselves. Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says social media helps teenagers find out who they are. We can share our favorite music or sports and learn about different opinions. People who use social media are not selfish. It can help shy people talk to others more easily.
Professor Andrew Phillips studies young people using social media. He says it helps quiet people with special interests find friends. If you like a special kind of music and only a few people at school like it too, social media helps you find more friends online.
Pauline White, a digital expert, says teenagers can find new hobbies online and create things like videos and blogs. This helps us learn and can be useful for jobs in the future. Businesses use social media to sell things, so it's good to know how it works. If you have many friends online, they can be your customers.
Jim Matthews agrees that using social media creatively is good for future jobs. Working with others online is an important skill today."
110,B2,"'When most people think of a family vacation, they do not think of a long trip through nine states in the US and a part of Canada. But my parents wanted a big adventure for our summer vacation. My dad planned a trip for us to spend time together as a family. My brother and I were not very happy about it. In June, we packed our car with bags and clothes. We left our home for a long trip. We drove west, starting in Oklahoma. We had some adventures, like almost getting caught in a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right to cross the road first! The next day, we woke up early and drove again. We saw deserts and mountains. We visited the Great Sand Dunes and Pagosa Springs in Colorado. We saw many things, like old and new buildings. We took pictures at the Four Corners Monument, even though it was closed. We saw wind farms and went to Yellowstone National Park. We saw bears and took many photos. We stayed in a very old hotel with no internet, but the views were beautiful. After visiting Canada, we drove back home. My parents were right. We did not need to go far to see amazing things. It was nice to be home, and I did not fight with my brother during the trip. We took many photos to remember our journey. I will remember the fun and unexpected moments.'"

112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger's teacher thought she might write a book one day. Charlotte wanted to try writing a book when she was 13. Now, her book is going to be published. Her teacher was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book when she was older. Charlotte did not want to wait. 
Charlotte is 15 years old. Her book is very good. It has a lot of action. It does not seem like a teenager wrote it. Charlotte is smart and confident. She knows she is young and does not have all the answers. She likes to ask big questions in her book. 
Charlotte thinks many books for teenagers show the same types of characters. She does not like this. She wants stories about teenagers who are okay and know who they are. 
Charlotte likes reading fantasy books. But sometimes they made her feel she could not write a good book. She learned from a book called ""How Not to Write a Novel"" that it is important to keep the reader guessing. 
Charlotte's parents are journalists. Her dad helped her get her book read by someone in publishing. She knows she was lucky. But she also knows that writers need to be good to succeed."
113,B2,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our teacher. We looked at the ski slope. ‘Who wants to go first?’ he asked. The group looked nervous. Then David, who knew a bit about ski-jumping, went first. He skied fast and jumped. But something went wrong. He fell and lost his skis. Gareth said, ‘Speed can be tricky.’ I thought maybe freestyle skiing was not for me. I liked skiing slowly and practicing turns. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks on ramps. I thought it looked fun, but I was scared to try. My parents took us on a winter holiday to a freestyle skiing center in the US. It had trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. We practiced tricks and landed in foam cubes. After practicing inside, we went outside to try for real. The center said, ‘You will get better!’ Gareth said, ‘If you land wrong, it will hurt.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part before the slope goes down again. If you land there, it hurts. So, you need speed. At first, I was scared to go fast. I slowed down and landed on the knuckle. It hurt. Gareth said, ‘Control the jump.’ On day two, we used trampolines. I thought I would not like it, but it was fun. We learned how to move in the air. Gareth said I needed to work on this. I tried again on the mountain. I finally landed right. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But on the last jump, I went fast, landed well, but my skis came off and slid down the slope."""
114,B2,"'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at a fun park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster goes up slowly. It stops for a moment. Then, it drops fast, and you feel your stomach in the air. You go forward, left, and upside down. You feel scared and scream. But you wanted to go on the ride, like many people every year. Amusement parks are big business. They have exciting rides to make people happy. Many people work to make these rides, like engineers and designers. Making a rollercoaster is hard. It must be fun and safe. It also needs to be new and exciting. A long time ago, a man named John Miller made many rollercoaster ideas. Today, people use his ideas to make rides. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker said making a ride is like putting pieces together. Dr. John Roberts said the ride should feel exciting but safe. The ride should tell a story, like a space trip or a jungle chase. Professor Walker said that experience and trying new things help make good rides. Jeff Hornick said you need to like thrills to make rollercoasters. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rides. Walker said it can add fun, but the real ride is still the most important part. New technology is exciting, but the real rollercoaster will be the best for a long time.'"
115,B2,"Miranda Ellington is 25 years old. She is a choreographer. She makes dances for many theatres and dance companies. Sometimes, she still dances too. She likes to remember what it feels like to be a dancer. It helps her understand dancers better. As a choreographer, she teaches young students. She likes working with them because they are open to new ideas. They want to succeed and listen to feedback. 
When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on dance steps. The music helps her decide what to do. Sometimes, she does not like the music, but she still tries to make a good dance. She cannot change the music because it is already chosen. She wants to try new things, but she works on big shows where the music is fixed.
Miranda does not work with just one theatre or school. She likes to meet new people and learn new ways of working. This helps her stay flexible and not do the same thing all the time.
There is a new documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda thinks it shows real life in a dance company. It shows how hard dancers work. 
Miranda believes a great dance show has good music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Everything must work well together. Sometimes, costumes or props can be distracting, which is disappointing.
Miranda does not want to be known for just one type of dance. She wants to try many things and learn more."
116,B1,"'A friend asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said you can see nice things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to see outside? This talk gave me an idea for a fun trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was throwing away his old sofa, and it became the star of the film. I put three wheels on it and used old seatbelts to pull it. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it every night, even on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and cheered me on. I have walked a lot before, but this was new. It was the longest walk I ever did, and I could stop at a café to rest and have a coffee. I told people, ""No, I’m not doing it for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon."" When someone at work asks about my weekend, I like to say I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England. You can watch the film on my website.'"
117,B1,"'I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands. I was excited. I never went on a group trip before. My brother was busy, so I went alone. At the Greek port, a man was surprised when I asked for one ferry ticket. Many families go to the islands. I told him I would join ten other people to swim around the islands. He smiled and showed me the way to the boat. Our group sent emails before the trip, but we did not talk much before our first swim. Our guides said a boat would help us if needed. We did a short swim to see how fast we were. Then, we did a 1.5 km swim. I was nervous. I swam in a pool and a river before, but not in the sea. The waves were big, and I was slow. I saw faster swimmers like dolphins. I wanted to finish the swim and was happy when I did it. The next days were the same: jump in, swim, and look at the view. The swims got longer, and I got faster. I did not need the help boat much. I want to come again next year.'"
118,B1,"Being a flight attendant is not easy. But I like it because I travel a lot. I have been to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with nice people and have a lot of free time. Life is never boring, so it is a good job for me!
When I was a child, I went to school in another country. I flew alone and felt lonely. I asked flight attendants if I could help give out meals. Some said yes. I remembered this when I wanted to leave my banking job and try something new.
At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people. Many got the job. They were smart and wanted a new career. I practiced what to say at the interview. I talked about my strengths and past jobs. I got the job!
I think being a flight attendant is a good job. There are many good things about it. Free flights are nice, but not the best part. The people I work with are like a family. We work hard together. When I am not working, I do not have to think about work. If I meet difficult passengers, it is okay because the flight will end soon."

But rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel scared, but we help them try, and they all reach the top. This makes them happy. Some children miss home at the start of the week. It is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their phones all the time. We say they can call home after lunch. If they ask again after dinner, we say it's too late now, call tomorrow. Most children feel okay after a few days. At the end of the week, they thank us because they had fun. Sometimes, parents call a lot to ask about their child. This is not needed. Often, the child is busy playing games, so we tell parents to call later. Some children come in new, expensive clothes. They don't want to change clothes, but soon they understand why they need to.'"

It won ‘Best Musical’ four times in the USA! In the UK, young actors can do fewer shows each week. So, they needed more actors in London. The director found many good actors in the UK. They won their first ‘Best Musical’ award in London. The London theatre is bigger than the one in the USA. It is full every night. People want to hear the songs from America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘I love playing music and I get paid for it. I play a beautiful Gibson guitar.’ Jamie said the young actors are busy. They have school lessons at the theatre. He misses his old school friends. His class came to see the show. The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. His class loved the show. Jamie’s parents come when they can, but tickets are expensive. I told Jamie I play guitar too. He gave me a guitar to play with him and the other actors. We played a song called Days. Jamie helped me learn it. I was happy when I played it right. Jamie is very good at music. I wished I could play like him. The young actors are good musicians. Some play many instruments. But they never played in a band before. They found it easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural on stage. They forgot to smile at first! The show will be in London for another year. It is very good to see.'"
