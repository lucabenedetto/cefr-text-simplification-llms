1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—announcing your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing realization that sharing everything online might have negative consequences. The internet offers endless possibilities to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we feel lost. It might seem depressing, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame—long before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. Back then, the web was mostly used by grad students, scientists, and a few curious teens like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He built a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and people were drawn to his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was the work of an exhibitionist, there was also a discipline and beauty to it that could be considered art. 

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was given an ultimatum: ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Publishing his life online, Hall realized, made people not trust him. He chose to end the blog, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people want to be with you, you'll be disappointed. 

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent her blog's address to all the company's vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our digital lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film combined documentary and drama to suggest that there is much about our universe that we don't understand. Generally, scientists agree with this idea, as even the most confident physicist wouldn't claim to know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to publicly criticize the film, calling it anything from ""atrocious"" to ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film intriguing to many.

Initially, the film seemed harmless, with scientists discussing how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But the controversy arose when the film talked about discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be influenced by thoughts. The film presented this claim with images of ice crystals that looked nice after being exposed to positive thoughts and unpleasant after negative ones. While some people found this evidence convincing, many scientists were skeptical, saying, ""Give me a break."" They argued that such claims need solid proof, and pretty pictures aren't enough.

The real issue was that the film's claims weren't strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a mysterious energy linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This isn't just based on pictures but on decades of research worldwide. Recent discoveries show that the universe is indeed stranger than we imagined. Astronomers have found that the universe consists of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy.""

Beyond the film, other discoveries are equally fascinating. Neuroscientists have found that our conscious perception of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay our brains edit out. Anthropologists believe they have pinpointed where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest connections between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.

Despite what some might think, science is far from complete. In fact, we seem further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit our understanding. This has led top theoretical physicists to work on a ""Theory of Everything,"" aiming to explain all forces and particles in the universe with one equation. But for many, the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,"In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade and the wind rustles their leaves, which sometimes turn a brilliant gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, attracting bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is to write short stories after finishing a novel and then switch back to a novel after completing a set of short stories. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. It seems that each type of writing uses different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories at first, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. It felt like my fictional world expanded, and readers appreciated this new side of my writing. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This marked my beginning as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to get a short story into decent shape, though revisions can be endless. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You can finish a short story quickly and move on. Writing a novel can feel like it drags on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I'll make it through. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace for me. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It's often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me where it wants to go. Also, with short stories, you don't have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn't work out, you can just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't create masterpieces every time. This is comforting to me. You can learn from your mistakes and use that knowledge in your next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows or faint footprints I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt at the time. They are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,"Science, at its core, can be as abstract as philosophy or as practical as curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats to our existence. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, from atoms to the immense cosmos. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, its dangers are misunderstood, and its importance is both overestimated and underestimated. The mistakes of science and scientists are sometimes ignored or exaggerated. 

The journey to explain the universe has been full of conflict. Old theories are often changed or completely overturned, much like how new music styles are initially mocked but later become popular. The battle between old and new ideas is rarely graceful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. The history of science is marked by conflict. This book looks at science as a series of ideas that have changed not just science but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book focuses on ideas, appreciating their beauty and creativity, but also questioning them and recognizing the limits of human understanding.

Science is always changing. There is always a scientist somewhere disproving another's theory. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they lead to major shifts in our beliefs. In the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics challenged basic assumptions, showing us that observing the universe can change it and that we don't fully understand our basic concepts. Some people see the changing nature of scientific theories as a sign that science can't fully explain the universe. However, scientific changes often improve our ability to understand and predict nature. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science often makes mistakes but continues to progress. 

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was little left to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, the electron, the nucleus, hundreds of new particles, quantum mechanics, relativity, antimatter, dark matter, black holes, chaos theory, the Big Bang, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe's origins and workings. Maybe. 

Science is not just an intellectual hobby. In the last two centuries, we have gone from observing nature to controlling it, sometimes disrupting natural balances without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists can no longer ignore scientific advances that will shape the world their children will live in and the kind of children they will have. Science is now part of how humanity plans and shapes its future. Deciding the future is not just for philosophers; these decisions can impact national budgets, the health of future generations, and even the long-term survival of life on Earth."
5,"Since around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped increasing and even dropped in some cases. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. An anonymous publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed word. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books keeps coming up. Whether people are predicting or dismissing this idea, the thought of books disappearing continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium replacing another often follows the introduction of new technologies. Even before digital technologies, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and workplaces. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones, all supposedly threatening print books at different times. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the book's death often appears during technological changes, reflecting our hopes and fears about these changes. To understand why these reactions are common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we develop close ties with objects like books, TVs, and computers, sometimes even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it doesn't just mean economic and social change; it also affects our bond with something integral to our daily lives. As technology advances, we often long for what we used to have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people sought original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power to change and our resistance to it. One way we make sense of change is by using familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings. These stories are easy to remember and share, reflecting both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, almost every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds from the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, showing them as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you nap afterward."" In this way, my book is somewhat superficial. It focuses on the conditions of creative work, not the work itself; it’s about the process rather than the meaning. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about your inner self, and I think that's true. The book addresses questions I face in my own life: How do you balance meaningful creative work with earning a living? Is it better to dedicate yourself entirely to a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to be more efficient, as my dad always says, ""work smarter, not harder""? I don’t claim to answer these questions definitively—some might not have clear answers and may require personal compromises—but I’ve tried to show how various successful people have dealt with similar challenges. I wanted to illustrate how big creative ideas are built through small daily efforts and how work habits affect the work itself. The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it’s really about routines. Routines might seem ordinary or thoughtless, like being on autopilot. However, a good routine can help you make the most of limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A solid routine can channel your mental energy and help you avoid being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that by forming good habits, we can free our minds for more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and couldn’t stick to a regular schedule. Interestingly, it was my own procrastination that led to this book. One Sunday, while trying to write a story for the architecture magazine I worked for, I ended up tidying my desk and making coffee instead of working. I’m a morning person, focused in the early hours but not very productive after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found these stories entertaining and thought someone should collect them, which led to my Daily Routines blog and eventually this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of people’s routines as I found them in biographies, magazine profiles, and obituaries. For the book, I expanded and researched more thoroughly while keeping the original’s brevity and variety of voices. I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources. This book wouldn’t have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose research I used. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of an unexpected change in his family's plans when he was six. His father, worried about rising interest rates and their mortgage, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. There, on a gloomy August day, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. This discovery sparked his interest in palaeontology. By the end of his university studies, he knew he wanted to focus on the earliest periods of life, not the more popular Jurassic era with its dinosaurs. He was fascinated by the beginnings of life, studying ancient, delicate creatures in rocks.

After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard was concerned about finding a job, especially in a place he wanted to work. He was confident in his abilities but knew that getting a job in academia wasn't always fair. When a position at Tavistock College in London opened, he applied, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't attend due to an accident. His replacement on the panel disliked the absent professor and made sure Howard got the job instead. Howard was initially grateful for the unexpected support, but later learned the truth. He was only slightly disappointed, as the important thing was that he had the job he wanted.

Howard often compared the structured nature of his scientific work with the unpredictability of life. He realized how strangers could unexpectedly change one's life, as happened when his briefcase, containing lecture notes, was stolen at an Underground station. Frustrated, he returned to the college, postponed his lecture, and reported the theft. While having coffee with a colleague and a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, he learned about a new collection of fossils that needed study. This opportunity became his greatest challenge and secured his professional future. If not for the theft, he wouldn't have known about it. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding the funds to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is open to trying unusual foods. At his home, he has ice cream made from bee larvae, which, despite looking like maggots, tastes slightly nutty and floral. Spence, a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, is working on making eating insects more acceptable. His research focuses on how our senses combine to create our perception of flavor, influencing what we eat and drink. This includes working with large food companies and top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how various factors, such as who we eat with, the presentation of food, and even background noise, affect our taste experience. His book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-authored with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers many interesting insights, like how the first person to order in a restaurant tends to enjoy their meal the most, and how we eat more when dining with others.

Spence's lab at Oxford is simple and not high-tech, allowing him to collaborate creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less prestigious in universities, but now it's valued for its real-world impact. Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, often doing so gradually so consumers don't notice the change. He explains that if people are told about these changes, they tend to focus on the taste and might not like it as much.

Spence's work with sound and flavor led to a collaboration with Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, resulting in the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish. Spence notes that the Italian futurists experimented with sound and food a century ago, but it didn't become popular. Today, the food industry is using Spence's research widely. For example, he found that high-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds can make it taste bitter. An airline plans to match music with meals, and a brand released an app that plays music while ice cream softens, though they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence finds common.

At home, Spence's dinner parties are experimental, featuring unique elements like rabbit fur on cutlery and remote-controlled lights. For him, home, shops, food events, and international conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, fake facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what is important and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most of these things on our own. We are juggling many roles while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows, with the help of our smartphones. These devices encourage us to fill every spare moment with activity. However, there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, but this is a misleading and risky belief. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried that something will fall apart. Ironically, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can overstimulate the brain and cause confusion. Multitasking also creates a craving for distraction, rewarding the brain for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain, is easily distracted by new things, making it hard to stay focused. Just having the chance to multitask can harm our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an unread email sits in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This loss is greater than the effects of fatigue. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, instead of the hippocampus, which organizes facts and ideas. Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to answer a text or ignore it. Decision-making is hard on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can end up making poor choices about important things. In discussions with business leaders, scientists, and writers, email is often mentioned as a problem. The issue is not with email itself, but with the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and accomplish other tasks."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they struggle to find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions would have seemed irrelevant. Scientists focused on animal behaviors and their outcomes, not on whether animals had feelings or moral systems. But recently, this has started to change. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This shift has reached popular science books, such as Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has sparked a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a conscience, a sense of right and wrong? 

In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Those that opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure, jumping and kicking, than those that had help. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does this mean for how we produce and consume beef? The observations are clear, but their interpretation is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the brink of a major ethical revolution. Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, suggests we should reconsider our view of animal cognition. He believes animals have a simpler theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail argues against attributing human traits to animals. The disagreement is philosophical: can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asked?

Balcombe describes an experiment suggesting starlings, a type of bird, can get depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other lived in small, barren ones. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. Later, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the birds in the comfortable cages ate them. Balcombe concluded that the starlings in poor conditions became pessimistic. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, believes our view of animals will change, much like our views on racism have. He argues we can't support animal rights while eating meat. If he were alone in this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares similar views. Manning, author of ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour,"" notes a shift in thinking. In the early 20th century, some believed animals thought like humans, but there was a backlash. Now, the pendulum is swinging back. It's a contentious topic, and it's important to avoid personal biases and strong opinions."
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is about engaging deeply with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., notes that while technology helps us store and process information, it might also be changing how we solve complex problems, making deep thinking harder. We are often bombarded with poor but appealing ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Surprisingly, despite having more information, our thinking quality hasn't improved much.

The National Endowment for the Arts reports a decline in literary reading, which some, like Patricia Greenfield from the Children’s Digital Media Center, believe might be linked to a drop in critical thinking. She suggests that focusing more on visual media and multitasking could be affecting our ability to concentrate on one thing. However, we still don't have a clear answer on how technology impacts critical thinking. Technology's influence is complex, and its effects can vary. For instance, a computer game might either enhance or hinder critical thinking. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links might prevent deeper thought.

Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that while reading boosts imagination and critical thinking, visual media can improve certain types of information processing. Yet, most visual media don't allow time for reflection or imagination, which can lead to underachievement, especially in younger people.

How society perceives technology affects views on critical thinking. This is evident in the debate over video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games, often seen as unhealthy, can actually be great learning tools. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in realistic virtual settings. They allow players to explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise.

In today's digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's crucial to examine technology closely and understand its nuanced effects on thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford, when not writing about how we should live, works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy institutions. His first book praised the benefits of manual work, while his latest book is a philosophical guide on dealing with modern life. The idea for this book came when he noticed ads appearing on a credit card machine while entering his pin. Crawford realized that these constant demands on our attention are hard to escape. We should be able to choose what we focus on, but often we can't because of things we're not fully aware of. It's becoming harder to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people isolate themselves and avoid simple interactions like talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we often experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us and take over our desires. This concern is shared by many, like office workers who complain about emails but spend their free time on them. Studies show that just having a phone visible can distract us, a common experience for those who feel drawn to their phones during dinner. There's no scientific proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we're more aware of other things we could be doing. While it seems like a technological issue, Crawford believes technology has just amplified our self-focus. With endless choices, our self-control is tested, affecting our social interactions. We prefer texting friends to avoid real conversations. By interacting with representations of people instead of real people, we risk losing something vital in society. Screens are only part of the issue. Crawford uses his gym as an example: it used to have one music player for everyone, which could cause tension. Now, people use earbuds to listen to their own music, making the gym less social. Real connections often happen through resolving conflicts, like differing music tastes. Crawford suggests two solutions: regulating noise and distractions in public spaces, and engaging in skilled practices for a more fulfilling life. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who engage with the real world. No virtual experience can match the feel of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under tires. These roles require good judgment and managing others in the same space. Engaging with the world this way makes manufactured experiences seem less appealing. It's not about everyone becoming a chef, but about using your judgment. This approach offers benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions is tiring and reduces focus on important things. Focusing on one thing makes it easier to pay attention to others."
13,"""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question in small talk, as we often define ourselves by our jobs. For most people, it's easy to answer, but for a philosopher like me, it's a bit more complicated. Calling oneself a philosopher can sound pretentious because it might suggest having access to some higher truth, which is not the case. Philosophers are just like everyone else, but this stereotype persists. 

One reason for this stereotype is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others' actions and value intellectual life. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, believed that a life of contemplation was the most virtuous. While few modern philosophers agree, philosophy is still associated with intellectual pursuits. Socrates, another Greek philosopher, said, ""the unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that blindly following cultural norms is unsatisfying. Reflecting on life helps us make our own decisions, but it doesn't require deep philosophical study. It means examining our daily experiences to ensure they are meaningful. This reflection is practical and should be shared, as it's part of living a good life.

Another reason for the misconception about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become disconnected from everyday life. This is partly due to university systems that prioritize expensive and inaccessible journals, limiting philosophers' ability to share their ideas beyond a small group of experts. For outsiders, philosophy can seem distant from reality. While some philosophers once challenged this view, many now accept it. The university system has created an isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As philosophical debates become more technical, explaining them to non-experts is challenging, leading some areas of philosophy to withdraw from society. This needs to change.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I work in ethics, which evaluates human actions. However, this title feels limited because ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. Recently, ethics has come to mean applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today often decide if an action is ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions, and I engage with them regularly. But philosophy is more than that. A discussion might start with whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps us examine the practices that shape our lives. Sometimes we confirm what we know; other times, we find our beliefs are hard to justify. By examining these ideas, we contribute to everyone's benefit."
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and those who appreciate food might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. Historically, though, philosophers have often used food as a way to discuss other topics, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food actually explore other, loosely related ideas. 

Take the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, for example. He believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in all areas of life. Yet, his name is now closely linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites, likely because these businesses hope to gain credibility by associating with a famous philosopher.

Food is inherently social and cultural. It comes from historical backgrounds and is shared with our communities, which provide dining companions and the systems for growing and distributing food. We interact with food more often and more fundamentally than with any other product, making it a natural subject for philosophical study.

Once food is prepared, critics start discussing and writing about it. But why do they have such a special status? One philosopher points out that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, food critics are just better at describing flavors. Philosophically, the mechanisms of taste perception have been overlooked, with most research focusing on vision, which should be addressed.

Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in aesthetic discussions like sculpture or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike art or music, which lasts over time. This makes it difficult to consider food as an object of aesthetic value.

There are many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices, which is a valid area of study.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of personal relationships. In home kitchens, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional chefs, however, have responsibilities to their employers and the food, meaning their kitchens are only open to qualified staff, and their relationships are professional.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by appreciating others' food and by forming personal connections through shared meals, a practice with a long history in diplomacy. The essay is filled with examples and stories that make this aspect of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, an American game designer, creates 'legacy' board games. He found traditional board games from his childhood less exciting and challenging, so he began to think about how they could change. He wondered if games could have a storyline or if decisions made in one game could affect future games. He transformed a classic game, Risk, into a 'legacy' version called Risk Legacy. In this version, decisions made during the game have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at key moments. These games are played over a set number of sessions, and personal rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said, ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau was later asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular cooperative game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was SeaFall, a game set in the age of sail (16th to mid-19th century), where players explore and conquer new lands. Designing legacy games is complex because designers must consider all possible player choices to keep the story intact. They use testers to see how the games unfold. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said it takes a lot of time. Sometimes a game works well at first, but then it breaks, and everything has to be redone.

Legacy games were not expected to become mainstream. Daviau thought they would appeal to a small group. He said, ‘This is really different and I think it’s pretty good, but it’s weird and breaks a lot of taboos.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He sees it as a major advancement in game design, offering a new level of commitment and excitement. Ben Hogg, another fan, said the unfolding adventure is more important than concerns about the game's longevity. He compared it to watching a movie for the experience, not to see it twice.

The legacy format is influenced by video games and the popularity of episodic TV series. Daviau, who once wanted to be a TV writer, found storytelling appealing. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel, needing a clear beginning and end, but also more than just an outline. While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is curious to see how others will develop the idea. He believes gamers will soon look for something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, thinks the legacy format has changed how people think about board games."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like something from a children's movie, became popular online. People enjoy these stories because they like to imagine animals behaving like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very intelligent despite looking so different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

While some think that attributing human traits to animals is unscientific, Dr. Frans de Waal, a researcher of primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, argues the opposite. He believes that denying animals' human-like traits, which he calls ""anthropodenial,"" has been a common mistake. By studying animal behavior, he shows that animals can do many things once thought to be unique to humans, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often think.

De Waal notes that in the past, people recognized animals' intelligence more. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, naturalists, including Charles Darwin, explored the similarities between human and animal intelligence. However, in the 20th century, behaviorism, which focused on conditioning animals with rewards and punishments, changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as simple machines or robots with instincts, and anyone who thought otherwise was considered unscientific.

This change in thinking happened at a time when humans were destroying animal habitats, polluting the environment, and treating livestock poorly. Fortunately, de Waal believes we are now starting to see animal intelligence as part of a spectrum that includes humans. He notes that recent decades have brought a lot of new knowledge about animals, shared widely on the internet.

De Waal argues that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they’ve hidden nuts, while we need apps to find our lost phones. In her book ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might judge us on how many color patterns we can make on our skin. Seeing us fail, they might think we are not very smart.

De Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape story. He thinks it’s unlikely that Inky knew how to find a drain leading to the ocean. However, he acknowledges that viral stories like this can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers became upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but what really convinced people was a short video of the experiment released later. This shows how our human minds work in interesting ways."
17,"Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialization. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for years, but experts say we are about to see a big increase in their use across many industries. However, many countries are not ready for this change. Most people agree that robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, but they still believe their own jobs will remain unchanged. This is not likely, as robotic automation will affect every industry soon. For instance, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a task that would take two human workers much longer. In San Francisco, Simbe Robotics has introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to ensure products are stocked and priced correctly.

Supporters of robotic automation point out that robots still need humans to service and program them, which could create new, high-skilled jobs. Critics, however, worry about losing the human touch in workplaces. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans safely. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will start creating laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field are expected to rise, but there will still be a shortage of skilled workers.

Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be most affected by automation and should focus on retraining rather than relying on government protection. New developments in robotics will lead to advanced robots for consumers, like those we see in science fiction. These changes offer great opportunities for businesses but also require new regulations to protect safety and privacy. With many jobs at risk, education is crucial to prepare for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered the question of why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response highlights a common curiosity: why do people engage in such dangerous activities? Mallory's answer might inspire some to pursue their dreams, challenging them to face the unknown. The simplicity of his response suggests that climbing might be about adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He argued that the style of climbing, such as using more or less equipment, should match the rules of the specific climbing ""game."" Over time, this idea has become central to discussions about climbing in the West, influencing everything from magazines to debates.

For many climbers, the appeal of climbing is the sense of freedom it provides. However, climbing can also be restrictive, like when climbers are stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and confining. Yet, the limited choices in climbing can also bring a sense of simplicity, which is another form of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective in his essay. He suggests asking ""Why do people climb?"" instead of ""Why climb?"" Fitschen believes climbing is part of our nature, an evolutionary trait that drives us to take on challenges and test our limits, despite the risks. This means the joy of climbing is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor adds another viewpoint. He argues that climbing helps develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are crucial in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing, therefore, has practical value by helping people develop qualities that are beneficial in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who rely solely on themselves, without help from others or technology, must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred controversy by suggesting that independent climbs deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or with aids like bottled oxygen. Their essay may have encouraged some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Exploring climbing beyond the Western perspective, many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, meditative focus, and intuitive problem-solving involved in climbing are similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This connection offers another reason why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known for being intellectual and sometimes serious, focusing on European piano music. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he rarely taught. Those close to him saw a playful side, but it was not often shown in his concerts. His life was a disciplined routine of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert, asking for lessons. At first, Brendel didn't take it seriously. He had taught very few students and didn't see a reason to start. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, ""You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk."" But something about Kit, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played beautifully from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital he had done. Brendel thought, ""I have to make time for him."" Kit's performance was rare, showing a deep understanding and subtlety.

As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is slowly entering it, with Brendel cautious about him burning out. Now 19, Kit is always busy outside of lessons, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under his mother's watchful eye. He also composes music. Brendel believes composing is important for understanding music better. He noticed Kit's incredible memory and ability to read music at sight. More importantly, Kit listens to his own playing and understands Brendel's guidance, applying it throughout a piece.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations. He is upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, as it can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit plays some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

At 80, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He reflects, ""When I was young, I didn't aim to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them, but there was room for more, so I continued. Although I lack physical strength now, my mind is active with music I never played. I don't perform anymore, but it's a nice new phase."""
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad's garden wasn't in a dirty city; it was by a river, gently sloping down to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this—places of escape, peace, and solitude. Grandad's garden wasn't fancy. He didn't have a greenhouse like some neighbors, who made theirs from old window frames with plastic patches where glass had broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved, but he wasn't without humor. He enjoyed using phrases like ""It's immaterial to me"" instead of just saying ""I don't mind."" He probably felt disappointed for not achieving more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn't passionate about. He wasn't very ambitious, though he and my mom once considered moving to Canada, but it didn't happen. However, he was very skilled at home repairs, like building bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing furniture. Just as we got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I did like the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never offered piano lessons; they were for my sister. When I asked my mother later why I wasn't given the chance, she simply said, ""You'd never have practiced.""

Given the choice of moors, woods, or river, I always chose the river. I would explore with a fishing net, wearing old sandals with the fronts cut out for my growing toes. I'd find a spot to leave my sandals and picnic, then wade into the water, looking for fish to catch and take home. After failing to keep them alive, I would release them back into the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father mentioned a job opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. He thought I might be interested. Despite his own lack of interest in gardening, I like to think he saw my passion for it and hoped things would work out if I pursued it. Maybe I'm fooling myself, but I believe he noticed my enthusiasm for gardening and hoped it would lead to something good."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches on the Isle of Muck, a small Scottish island, and I do the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen's sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and MacEwen gently pets him. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen is completely at ease on his island. He points out the nearby islands: Eigg to the north, Rum to the west, which gets twice as much rain, and Soay beyond Rum. As rain approaches, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep, and we head down the slopes. He tells me about the island: it's volcanic, three kilometers long, and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. As we herd the sheep, Tie struggles to control them, and MacEwen is disappointed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin looks after the cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their children can explore the island freely. However, island life has its challenges, like limited electricity. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on, and the next morning, Mary prepares breakfast by torchlight. There's no mobile phone service, but Mary says there's reception on the hill. Most visitors give up and put their phones away, and I do the same. Life on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. A boat brings groceries and three musicians for a concert in the tearoom, which is a big success. That night, by the fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on Soay without seeing it, and Jenny was sent to manage it, despite only having typing skills. I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. I eat well, with most food coming from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish, which I bring back for dinner. The fish is delicious. The next morning, I hope for my ferry to arrive, as many have been canceled due to rough seas. If it doesn't come, I'll be on Muck for two more days, which I secretly wish for, despite the lack of phone service."
22,"The game design industry was once mainly filled with computer scientists and self-taught individuals, offering few entry paths. It was often seen as a hobby for young enthusiasts, but now it's taken seriously. Industry experts aren't surprised by this change. Creating video game spin-offs for new movies requires large teams and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it's hard to break into, but it's growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says it's tough to make progress in big companies or influence major games. However, the industry needs more game designers, not just directors but also those who design systems and specific parts of games.

So, how can you enter this competitive field? While many companies prefer a computer science degree, Jim believes the key is to make games. The tools are available, and you need to create something to get a job or succeed independently. Game design is more a lifestyle than a job, requiring active participation.

Another expert, John Field, agrees that just starting is important but says it's more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry's demands, and even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense needed. Can you succeed alone? It's difficult, but a good postgraduate course in games can help by providing support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and arts, and they realize games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and understand the growing diversity of the medium. Networking is also crucial for success in the industry.

The stereotype of a teenage boy glued to a console is outdated. Games are now seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families play together on interactive consoles, and smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. Games are popular with large audiences and are also a great way to learn, offering expanding opportunities."
23,"Since I was a child, all I ever wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me, but he didn't force it on me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football altogether. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It's only through practice that you can score those exciting goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for years to achieve what they have. Sometimes you see young players bumping into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I emphasize enjoying learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope his habit of kicking them around doesn't mean he's like me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so younger players like me could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never told us, 'This is your big chance,' but we knew it was. Even though I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely a lot on close friends and family. Having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. People sometimes say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' Of course, I've helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong and would be offended by the idea of being on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to make life easier for those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off, maybe longer, to do things I haven't been able to do. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father couldn't write anything sellable there, and Sam was worried about losing clients and money. So, in desperation, Sam found us a cheap place to live. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn't popular with day-trippers. The road was unappealing, and the nearby resort of La Carmella was more attractive for those with some money. Only those who were broke or loved surfing would venture to Reef Point. But when the hot weather came, the place filled with people. After months of solitude, we were suddenly surrounded by activity. My father was busy trying to meet a script deadline and was in a bad mood. I spent most days on the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We didn't have a dog when we first moved, but Rusty adopted us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One day, I gave him water, and my father half-heartedly threw a boot at him. Rusty took this as a sign and stayed. I asked my father who Rusty might belong to, and he said, ""You're wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes, he brought things he hadn't dug up, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed tireless. One surfer stood out with her graceful style. She decided to finish for the day and rode a final wave to shore. ""Hi,"" she said, ""why didn’t you join us?"" ""I haven’t got a surfboard,"" I replied. ""You could get one,"" she suggested. ""No money,"" I said. ""You’re British, aren’t you? Visiting?"" she asked. ""No, I live here,"" I answered. ""Is your father American?"" ""No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he wrote."" ""No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?"" ""Rufus Marsh,"" I said. ""You mean, Tall as the Morning?"" she asked. I nodded. ""I read that cover to cover,"" she said, looking at me with new interest. I realized this was how it always was. People were friendly but only truly interested when I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,"Violet Hetherington was questioning her decision as she stood in a long, unmoving queue at the Southampton dock. She was waiting to board the Queen Caroline cruise ship. Her friend Annie, who was experienced in travel, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. However, this advice turned out to be wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers explained that there was a 'breakdown in the computer system,' which made the waiting passengers frustrated. Many felt they had paid a lot for this trip and were disappointed by the disorganized boarding process. Violet considered leaving but realized she had lost her phone, which was more troubling than the long wait. Without her phone, she couldn't contact the taxi company to check if she left it there, as all her important numbers were stored in it. Her son Harry had always warned her about relying too much on her phone for storing numbers. 

Violet asked a friendly-looking couple behind her in the queue if she could borrow their phone. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was in her flat. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble contacting people in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn't tell Harry that. Harry often thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding because he shared her forgetfulness. 

Finally, the queue started moving, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her spirits dropped further when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy, with fake walnut panels, lots of chandeliers, shiny brass, and airport-style carpets. She followed signs to the elevators, which were lined with mirrors and crowded with tired passengers. Violet was pressed against the side of the lift as it stopped at each floor, letting people out. At last, she reached the twelfth floor and was relieved to find her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn't. Ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she had paid the highest price she could afford to ensure she had a view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was uncovering the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he discovered 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing striking images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent morning, Maloof stood among these items, realizing he had stumbled upon something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ For some time, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together Maier’s life story. They contacted local families who employed her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit eccentric, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although she wasn’t very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed to be passionate about her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was done for commercial reasons. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or did she borrow ideas from those who came before her?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I progressed as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often hints at some failure. However, this isn't the case with Eleanor Catton's book, *The Luminaries*. I interviewed her in the UK when the book's success had made her very famous, but she remained calm, especially since she was still in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the official, who then asked, ""What's it about?"" This is not an easy question for an author. *The Luminaries* is set in 1860s New Zealand, where a series of crimes have occurred, and a group of 12 men gathers to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found that the past offered more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked how it felt to be so successful at a young age, she replied modestly, ""It's nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. There's a very supportive feeling at home; I got a lot of congratulations from other people's grandmas."" She added, ""What is annoying is when people assume I'm not trying to do something philosophical in the book."" Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part being half the length of the previous one, making it feel faster as it goes. I asked if it mattered whether readers noticed these details. She said, ""I wanted to create a book with structural patterns that didn't matter, but if you cared, you could see them."" Despite its experimental structure, *The Luminaries* is still an exciting murder mystery with a captivating plot. Surprisingly, she didn't plan the story in advance. ""I would write myself into a corner and then see how creatively I could get out of it,"" she said. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers. We also discussed her love for TV drama series. Considering how *The Luminaries* uses cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue, I asked if she might be interested in screenwriting. ""That could be pretty cool,"" she said. Her conversation was lively, with a warm, friendly laugh. She became animated when talking about her work and New Zealand. ""I always notice when I come to Britain how much my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to more populated areas, to be around more people."" But for now, New Zealand will remain her home. I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels."
28,"As a child, Jonny Kinkead loved using tools in his dad’s garage and playing the guitar. These hobbies became his career for the last forty years: he builds steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny is still fascinated by how two pieces of wood can create beautiful sounds, and how different types of wood produce different tones. He learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven and wanted to learn the bass guitar at sixteen. Instead of buying one, he decided to make it himself. He studied guitars to understand how their shapes and wood types affected sound. Although the bass was the first instrument he built from scratch, he and his brothers had been making model boats and planes, so he was used to building things. His father taught them how to use tools, and Jonny also repaired instruments for friends. 

Jonny’s bass guitar was a success, but he didn’t think of making guitars as a career yet. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university because it involved design. However, he left halfway through the course, realizing he was too individualistic for it. He discovered that guitar-building is like sculpture, as it involves shaping sound, and thought it was more practical than pure art because people use guitars. Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. Initially, he sold guitars for just the cost of materials, but as his reputation grew, he could charge more. Even now, nearly forty years later, he describes his work as ""still scratching a living"" because he can only make about ten guitars a year, limiting his income.

In the early years, Jonny worked hard to get noticed. He attended music festivals to let musicians try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which was challenging for him. Jonny believes it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were worth having, even though the UK had good instrument-making courses and skills. Now, UK hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve. Jonny says that while valuable techniques can be learned in courses, there’s no substitute for trial and error. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and trying different things. If you make mistakes, like making the back too thin or thick, the sound won’t be good. He believes self-taught makers learn more because they explore everything."
29,"Any discussion about English conversation often starts with the weather. This is a tradition, and many writers, like the famous Dr. Johnson from the 18th century, have noted that when two English people meet, they first talk about the weather. This observation is still true today. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why English people are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They fail because they mistakenly think that English people talk about the weather because they are genuinely interested in it. 

For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not interesting at all, and he finds the English obsession with it hard to understand. He points out that England doesn't have extreme weather like tornadoes or monsoons, which makes it seem dull. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because of its unpredictability. He says that living on an island means you can never be sure what the weather will be like.

My research suggests that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the real point. English people don't talk about the weather because they care about it; they use weather-talk as a way to start conversations and connect with others. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not really about the weather. They are like greetings or conversation starters. This kind of talk is similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially.

There are specific situations where English people use weather-talk. It can be a simple greeting, a way to break the ice and start a conversation, or a topic to fill awkward silences. This means that English people do talk about the weather a lot, which can make it seem like they are obsessed with it. An English conversation might start with a weather-related greeting, use more weather-talk to break the ice, and then return to weather-talk if the conversation slows down. This is why people from other countries, and even some English writers, think that English people are very interested in the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an impressive engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build a structure 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were already interested, as they had chosen this trip over more glamorous destinations like Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her explanations were lacking. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to provide context and human interest about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from a 31-year teaching career, Alice began a new career as an author in 2001. Although she had a successful teaching career, Alice felt she was venturing into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting; it’s a daily performance and physically demanding. Writing is exciting and nerve-wracking, but not as exhausting. My former colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my fiction.’ Alice aims to fill a gap in children’s fiction. ‘Many adolescent books today focus on negative experiences. They are well-written,’ she quickly adds, ‘but often dark or completely fantastical, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’ Alice always taught English and History together, like lessons on ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy, driven by her love for children. ‘I’m fascinated by the moment a child goes from being bored to interested, and from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because then the challenge is on me to engage them.’ She views her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was inspired to write her first novel due to a gap in the market, the idea also came from her approaching ‘empty nest’ as her sons were leaving home, and a suggestion from her head teacher to attend a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer on a course I didn’t think I needed.’ Before attending, she had to submit her best piece of fiction, a requirement she learned about just days before leaving. ‘I sat at the computer and created a story about a Roman couple and their unborn child.’ Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, other students reviewed her work, gave excellent feedback, and suggested she publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, critic and editor Zachary Leader, was crucial in editing her novel. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve written – he reads a chapter, changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, suggests different words. My instinct is to keep adding scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to compete in a unique race. The race would pit man against car and brother against brother. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny would drive a car on roads, while his younger brother Ali would race across the countryside on a mountain bike. 

""I'm looking forward to it,"" Jonny said at the start line. ""I've never done anything like this before; it's exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it's very cold right now, so I'll be warm in the car."" Alistair was also eager, but unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, he was dressed in full winter cycling gear. The cold didn't bother him. ""To be honest,"" he said, ""I've seen his driving before, so I'm not sure he'll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race began at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire's highest road, Fleet Moss, 350 meters up. This was no problem for the car, but Alistair's first few miles involved a steep 25 percent incline, making it tough from the start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss, while Jonny jumped in the car and hit the road. The next time they would see each other would be at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?

Jonny's early confidence was quickly challenged. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he encountered a giant tractor blocking the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he joked to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it's because of this farmer!"" After tense moments, Jonny got past the tractor and continued into the morning mist. Meanwhile, Alistair struggled with the slope. A few miles in, he had to get off and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched curiously as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the summit. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun shining, he had a chance to show his skills. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair picked up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another local challenge. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have been around since before cars were invented, and the roads are not built for speed. Jonny carefully navigated a narrow corner and drove through a stream on the road. Once clear of the last village, he raced straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping, he reached the line with a squeal of brakes. 

Finally, Alistair looked up. ""Is he here?"" he asked the waiting crowd. ""No? Really?"" He raised his arms in victory. ""Yes!"" Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car and stepped out. ""Well done,"" Jonny said, clearly disappointed. ""I'm gutted."""
32,"Playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a unique experience because of the silence. When you bounce the ball on the soft grass, you hear only the echo of your shots. The well-kept grass, the historic stadium, the players in white, and the respectful audience create a special atmosphere that feels separate from the outside world. This quiet helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to block out everything except the game and the point I'm playing. The silence is only broken by applause and cheers when a point is won. Even though there are fifteen thousand people watching, I feel distant from them. I am so focused that I forget millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life.

I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach forever, taught me that Wimbledon is the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends that I would play and win there one day. Before 2008, I had played and lost twice to Federer, including the final the year before. Losing in 2006 wasn't too hard because I was just happy to be there at age twenty. Federer beat me easily because I didn't believe in myself enough. But losing in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have done better, and it was my mindset, not my skills, that let me down. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing is always painful, but it's worse when you know you had a chance. Toni, who is usually very tough on me, tried to comfort me, saying there would be more chances. I told him he didn't understand, thinking it was my last chance to win. I know a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I felt I missed a big one in 2007. Toni couldn't ease my sadness, but he was right. Another chance came in 2008. I was confident I had learned from my defeat the year before, and I was determined not to let my mindset fail me again. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends, but we didn't talk about the match. They knew I was already mentally preparing for it, and I needed that space to be mine alone until the match began."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society helped make her famous by producing articles and TV documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is possibly the most celebrated female scientist of the 20th century, alongside Marie Curie. However, her fame might have overshadowed her real achievements. Many articles and books about her life often focus on her adventurous spirit or her role as a feminist, which can undervalue her actual work. Based on the number of academic references to her research, the success of her students, and the extensive data from her 40-year study, Jane Goodall should be recognized as a pioneering zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.

Before Goodall's work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. Her discoveries revealed that chimpanzees eat meat, use tools, and have emotions and social systems similar to humans. They also have unique cultural traditions across Africa. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is considered the most authoritative work on chimpanzee research. Her long-term study in Gombe State, Nigeria, is seen as one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world, according to biologist Stephen Jay Gould. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. At five years old, in the autumn of 1939, she disappeared one afternoon. The police and neighbors searched for her, and she reappeared at dusk with straw in her hair. She explained to her mother that she had been in a henhouse, hiding in the straw for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity foreshadowed her future as a biologist."
34,"In our first hour-long chat, Shirley Ford shows off her talent by speaking in the voices of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV, cartoons, and even those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I just did a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to say lots of medical terms.’ Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,’ she says. ‘But it’s more than that. You have to make the script come alive for an audience that can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for the publicity, but often they don’t get the parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a typical acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the studio manager suggested I try out for a rabbit in a cartoon soundtrack. It seemed silly – I didn’t study drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major role.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often voice young boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and lots of paperwork, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes everything from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. ‘Those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you’re talking – that makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that specialize in helping voiceover artists create them.’ She claims she reached the top of her profession through persistence as much as natural talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone thinking about a voiceover career, Shirley suggests attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is crucial, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a dream job for many kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more practical careers, like becoming a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do it. Most cartoonists have wanted to do it for a long time. In my case, I loved comic strips as a child, contributed to school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was earning enough to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are minimal, but it's still a challenging job. You shouldn't try to become a cartoonist unless you can't imagine doing anything else. It's easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don't turn down work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don't really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of cartooning? There was a time when many cartoonists could find steady work with newspapers and magazines. But those days are mostly over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create and sell your work. Cartoonists with average talent but good business skills often do better than artistic geniuses who lack those skills. I'm surprised by how many people are afraid someone will steal their ideas, even if they've never sold a cartoon. Some are so worried they won't let anyone see their work! To protect your work legally, just draw a 'c' for 'copyright,' circle it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving house and decided to get rid of some things. One of those things was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to get rid of this guitar? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man approached me, looking confused. He asked, ""You're not just going to throw that away, are you?"" I said I was, but I already felt a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways, but I felt a deep regret for years afterward.

Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. The email was from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back and used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so emotional. I would have paid anything, but his price was fair. I had forgotten my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have found this whole situation funny.

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s when it was very popular. I loved its calming sound, but I didn't make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn't need to be a great musician to be a rock star. When I got my guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. The guitar felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I felt the need to stand up and play it with a strap over my shoulder. My fingers remembered the chords, even though I couldn't draw them. My fingertips felt the familiar pain of pressing the strings.

The electric guitar isn't really a solo instrument, so now that I'm learning it again, I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are others my age with similar stories. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There's been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" which is about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Insomniacs, who I interviewed many of, know how crucial sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. Those who struggle to sleep often understand its importance the most. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? They haven't been talked about much. We often lose dreams, especially when we wake up early and miss the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, the stage rich in dreams. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years dreaming. When people are deprived of REM, they experience more intense REM sleep the next night, suggesting dreams have a purpose. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding the mind. However, later research didn't support this idea, and the study of dreams shifted to their physical origins. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than others. He concluded that dream use increases with interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams since films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Doesn't everyone—teachers, software designers, politicians—need to think creatively? Stickgold says dreams help us combine ideas in new, surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create combinations that break our usual thinking habits. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ""ignore the obvious and put together things that make a kind of crazy unexpected sense... This is what creativity is,"" says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you barely remember, seems to give some kind of fluency, fuel for thought. On those days, words and images come so quickly that my fingers can hardly keep up. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we deal with relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. In her studio, which has a stunning sea view, you see empty frames on the walls alongside photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading figure in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate the richness of early-20th century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Surprisingly, she doesn't keep any of her own work. ""As soon as I finish them, they go,"" she says. Susie is in high demand. Over her 30-year career as a copyist artist, she has recreated works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that even art experts can mistake them for the originals. While the originals could sell for millions, her copies sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie keeps her clients' identities mostly private, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but for others, status is important. One celebrity likes to show off his 'Van Gogh' painting, which is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. ""Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,"" she says. ""That's their choice."" Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank and displaying Susie's copy. Susie is always honest about her work. She makes her reproductions look as authentic as possible, believing that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as an original is illegal, and although she knows people who have profited from it, she has never been tempted. Those who make fakes often get into trouble. Susie isn't wealthy and has faced challenges, but her situation is more stable now, and risking her reputation doesn't make sense. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. It was a good foundation for her current work and sparked her love for plants, though it was hard to live on. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets but is glad to have found something more financially rewarding. When young artists ask for advice, Susie emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to achieve her skills. Her training allows her to do anything from drawing plants to making perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art. She now focuses on French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas as her favorites. Susie notes that people often think modern art is simple, almost like child's play. For example, impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very precise. This combination is challenging to master. Given her talent, it's surprising that Susie doesn't create her own original art. Isn't art about self-expression? And could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She explains that her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and it provides a good living. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—good, but not exceptional. Perhaps it's like living on simple food after a lifetime of gourmet meals. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest on it. From a young age, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a unique connection with the boats that took her around the world, working in perfect harmony with them. Once back on land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly longed to return to the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop race around the world, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was a small, cramped space where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how she meticulously planned everything, down to the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial. She proudly displayed her stock of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her attention to detail in maintaining the boat was as impressive as her sailing skills because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. This experience made her think differently and realize things she hadn't considered before. Seeing abandoned whaling stations felt like a warning about how we take resources and move on. When I met Ellen at her office, she had just finished a heated conference call. She explained why urgent action is needed to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways not to use them up,"" she said. Initially, her message was about using less, but she later focused on re-using, like promoting reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the past three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she admits, ""but I love learning. The current situation became something I couldn't ignore. Sailing seemed selfish in comparison. This is about finding how my voice can be most useful. It really matters.""

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It defines who I am. At sea, you are connected to everything around you, focused on records, practicalities, and survival. My new message isn't as simple as saying, 'I'm going to be the fastest around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I've done before."""
40,"Jordan Romero, at 13, aims to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If successful, he could become a very famous teenager. With many young people spending time on computers and games, he wants to inspire them to explore the outdoors. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen, and they call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is part of a bigger goal: if Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest to climb the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent. Few achieve this before 30. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might complete this before turning 20.

Many experienced Everest climbers doubt the wisdom of a 13-year-old attempting the climb. They agree a young climber might be physically strong but question if a teenager has the emotional strength and experience needed for safe climbing. The Romeros are aware of these concerns. Paul says, ‘I know there’s criticism, but I can’t focus on it. We think about risks, but our climbing experience helps. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He’s becoming strong and mature.’

There’s also the question of Jordan’s motivation. Is it his father’s ambition pushing him? Paul insists it’s not about him seeking fame through his son. They decided to pursue the goal now rather than later. They regularly check with Jordan to ensure he remains motivated. When asked what he enjoys about the challenge, Jordan says, ‘I just focus on achieving my goal.’

In the past, few cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. Now, every adventure is shared online, turning climbs into record-setting challenges. This creates a dilemma for Jordan. To inspire others, he must engage with the media, blog, and give interviews. He needs to offer something spectacular, like climbing Everest. Paul adds, ‘If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we’ll end this project and head to the gym.’"
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they're not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but even my classmates aren't very familiar with classical music. If you don't know the composers, you're unlikely to buy their music. For classical music fans, the statistics are disappointing. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells just 300 copies. It's hard to believe, but true. So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people often blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The simple fact is that classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who love classical concerts, but they're rare. Even though I'm a musician and play in an orchestra, I'm not a huge classical music fan. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm, with many mood changes, can be challenging for us. We like things fast. Experts say we struggle to focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop songs also have lyrics that appeal more to teenagers than long classical pieces without words. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online instantly, but we rarely choose classical. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says classical concert audiences have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many teenagers are in those audiences. In my orchestra, we play classical music in various places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why more people like classical concerts as they get older, but I do know that if teenagers' parents love something, they often avoid it. Some blame schools for teenagers' lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are eager to play in school orchestras. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy performing classical music, but it's not their first choice for listening. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you regret that I’m here,"" she said to the school, with a smile. Her mother was getting out of the car on the other side and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie wouldn’t have minded if she had. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings scattered among trees on a wooded hillside; it seemed confusing at first. Then she noticed the signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother replied. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved between the trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of trailing behind like a dog,"" Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t really expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll probably be expelled soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and headed towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was a nice old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. Bonnie always treated horses well. She could see they were well cared for. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, gently touching its nose. The next horse caught her attention. ""You’re the best one here!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He seemed lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick, according to the sign above his stall. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They must be nearby."" Bonnie was thrilled to find the room with the riding equipment unlocked. She was so focused on saddling Maverick that she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she saw. Her nickname at her old school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m not joking, because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She urged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,"" she confided. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and the breeze made her cheeks glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he’d be a good jumper."
43,"I've met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. At just 15 years old, the Australian has already released several successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up performing on stage for thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" He remembers how it all started. ""But back then, I was swimming every day and surfing. Those were the things that mattered more to me; I had my life planned out and plenty to keep me busy. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online."" These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans left comments online, asking for more videos on their social media. So Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The response was overwhelming. Cody was also a talented swimmer, training hard with top coaches and focusing on his sport. But then record labels showed interest, and he faced a tough decision: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a big risk by signing a record deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very hard for me—especially at such a young age—to choose a career. Can you imagine, at 12 or 13, trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I'm kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, recalling their shocked reactions. ""I'm very modest, and I think it's important to stay that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn't directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody believes it's important to have a close group of great people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, everyone has moments of doubt. ""Sometimes when I'm alone, I think, 'How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?' My little brother is eight, traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn't have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about how that affects him, but my family always reassures me that they're here to support and encourage me in everything I do."" Success, in any career, comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to your big opportunity, even when it's a bit scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be visiting countries I never thought I'd see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans—it's like something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won't last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbag wall, which was there to stop the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags into place. Last week, I worked long hours with most of the town's adults, showing I could handle it. But my grandfather didn't seem to notice. With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the wood factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and solid ice downstream. As I changed out of my pyjamas and into my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. I didn't recognize him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain—a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It's more special to me than having a famous grandfather because only he, my mom, and I know about it. Plus, I have his diary from that journey, which I keep under my pillow and read before bed. I patted the chain and headed to the kitchen. ""Morning, Rex,"" Mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. ""You're up early for a Saturday. I'll make brunch after your training. Be careful."" ""Thanks, Mom."" I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ""Watch where you're going!"" he shouted. ""Where are you off to?"" ""Sorry, Grandpa. I'm going kayaking."" As if my wetsuit didn't make that clear. As if he didn't see me kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore his temper, but it's getting harder. ""Why train? You didn't win the competition,"" he said. His words stung, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile. ""Don't mind him. He's..."" ""...not himself right now,"" I finished for her. I didn't say he's always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a kid, he was my hero—ever since he showed me his photos in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang in his room, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don't go in there anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. Yet, a part of me still wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ""At least he's coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your dedication, even on cold days!"" I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ""It'll be warmer in South America,"" I said. ""If I find sponsors for my expedition."" She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. In the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study, where an unframed painting leaned against the wall. It was clearly Grandpa's work, but different from anything he had done before and obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the painting. It featured a river that dominated the scene; it wasn't a river she recognized and might not even be real, perhaps just a fantasy. The picture was strange and shapeless, yet beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green that the eye almost missed, as it was drawn into the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice—too casual, too detached—that showed her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others interpret them if they could. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed to have a strange importance to her, though she couldn't say why. And there was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it—for him to be so specific. Still, he hasn't finished it yet, so maybe he'll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't resist. It's such an unusual picture, especially having a name. I suppose you can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to waste time telling every idiot..."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""...every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone who came along, they'd never get any work done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually to say the muse wasn't being kind to him that day, or that he'd have to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on, or something like that. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"This morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that's what happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I'll cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm quite unlucky that way. 

What I was actually trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute—small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet, so I was thrilled when she gave it to me. But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it needs to stand in a corner. 

I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to university, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But since Angela is only fifteen, I'll be in my small room for a while. I don't mind; I like my cosy little bedroom. It's like a nest, with a sloping roof and a window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only take a couple of centimetres off the bottom... 

Then it hit me. If I couldn't cut the cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he's always telling us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house, secretly taking things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation, I knew it would be challenging to meet fans' expectations. People who love the book have strong opinions about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' perspective, not the humans', which made filming more complex. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when filming them, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. To capture the Borrowers' view, the crew had to film from no higher than 15 centimeters off the ground, which wore out a lot of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. A big challenge was making the shadows look right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US director George Lucas called to ask how we did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry giant items like scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift, often making the crew laugh. In one scene, the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors were swept down a tunnel with hoses and found it so scary they didn't have to act. Getting the costumes right was important to me, and other directors have struggled with this. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend, and she couldn't sit during breaks or take the dress off because it was sewn on each morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don't think they appreciated my attention to detail! Most scenes away from the Borrowers' home were shot with actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren't accurate, but they worked. The budget didn't allow for special effects studio time during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren't there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, people pretending to be friends, and the requests for free tickets to my dad's concerts. ""Everything's going to be fine,"" I reassure her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted—to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the band is here for recording, we're staying permanently. I chose this school because I want to meet regular kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal. 

I walk into the school's main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she mishears, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused but types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. Luckily, few people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it's printing,"" she says, then hands me the schedule. English Literature is my first class. Great, I like English. I'll be late, though. It's in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night to avoid looking lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already calling roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles, checking out my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. Perfect, no one will suspect anything! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oops, maybe not so normal. ""Thanks,"" I reply. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says uncertainly. ""Here."" She smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After discussing the books we'll read this year, she lets us socialize. All teachers should do this. ""So why'd you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have options. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. A little lie works better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But I can pretend to be normal for now. ""He's an artist,"" I say, fiddling with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I'm Becca, by the way."" And she doesn't seem to care. Perfect."
49,"The average American teenage girl today is expected to do a lot: be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what being a teenager in America is like now. Teenagers can't just go to school and be average; they need to stand out. Being average is not enough, and not having big ambitions is seen as laziness. 

Many adults don't realize how much pressure teenagers face today. They have lots of homework, tests, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life. Teenager Kristen Loose explains this pressure. Despite these challenges, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes describe teenagers as lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might fit these descriptions, it's not fair to label the entire generation this way.

Loose points out that people often think teenagers spend all their time watching TV or on their phones. She disagrees, saying that while she keeps her phone close, it's not just for fun. It's a tool that helps teenagers manage their busy lives. Today, students are expected to be connected to the world and reachable at all times, which can seem like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can work anywhere, even on the go. Schoolwork and activities now demand attention around the clock, adding to the stress of already busy teens.

Many teenagers start their day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight, filled with school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20% of teens get enough sleep, and 28% admitted to falling asleep in school at least once a week due to lack of sleep.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time a week, which isn't much out of 168 hours. She doesn't waste this time on social media or TV but focuses on volunteering. Olsen believes the stereotype of teenagers is that they only care about themselves, but she enjoys volunteering and making a positive impact in her community.

In the future, the stereotype of teenagers might change, but they will continue to challenge it and push the world forward. A new generation of students will keep making a difference, even before they finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. This group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. Their project is a mix of science and adventure, which attracts teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or metal piece enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside was a camera, an altitude instrument, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, was used to inflate the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy had driven seven hours to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For these kids, such efforts are normal. Finally, it was time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chanted, and the balloon began to rise. Some ran and tracked it with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was a quiet sense of wonder. Then the balloon vanished into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at the clear sky, just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ a girl said softly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor shot across the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon expands until it bursts. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. The area around Bishop is mostly uninhabited, so the lunch box usually lands in remote places. ‘Recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, noting they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To reach it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘These students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to them.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but it was a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. And it was another adventure story to share."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. Her interest began by chance when she helped her younger brother with a science project. She found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology, which fascinated her and made her realize she wanted to pursue it. At that time, Palaeontology wasn't a common career choice for young people. Chloe recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. She was nervous about meeting him, worried he might find her annoying, but he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

Chloe discusses how palaeontologists are portrayed in movies and TV shows. Films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She finds the portrayal of palaeontologists as either eccentric geniuses or geeky losers misleading. Movies don't accurately show the reality of their work. Chloe's job involves digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. She also believes in communicating scientific findings to the public, especially to young people, to clear up misunderstandings about science and inspire interest in the natural world.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, where she advised on the accuracy of the dinosaurs portrayed. The program succeeded in attracting audiences of all ages because it depicted dinosaurs more accurately than movies like Jurassic Park. Chloe believes dinosaurs fascinate us because they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. They remind us that there is still much to learn and discover, and Palaeontology offers a form of time travel."
52,"I'm going to say this just once: when you're on a car trip with your family, even if you're six years old, you probably know you're not ""there yet,"" even as you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" And really, once you arrive, it's not ""there"" anymore; it's ""here."" So if you think you might be ""there,"" you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" And no one wants to be ""there"" more than the parents who keep hearing that question during long car rides. Seriously, what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing expected of you? You can watch DVDs you haven't seen, listen to music, or do puzzles, while the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, there's mom or dad, ready to hand out juice boxes and cookies, or change the radio station and temperature as needed – basically, making sure everything goes smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying – like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. What? He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it's his other foot, then a hand, and soon he's all over my space, and a fight starts. The driver and co-pilot reach back to separate us as the car speeds up and swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a bit. The beautiful scenery continues to pass by. Soon after, I'm trying to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. But the car isn't going fast, and the window isn't open. Where's it coming from? My brother is next to me, quietly blowing air on me. He's on his side, not touching me, so he's technically not doing anything wrong. Just breathing? What's the problem with that? The anger builds. Tim gets yelled at, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again – for now. Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us kids in the back seat. For example, when we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he often says, ""Yup. We're here. Get out of the car."" ""But Dad, we're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour."" ""Oh, well, then maybe we're not there yet."" That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you're finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move as far away as they can from the kids who have been bothering them for hours. So remember: if mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you're not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where customers can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains their motivation: ""With so much technology, everyone is busy on their phones. We wanted to bring people together without screens. It's natural for us to connect and communicate.""

The games at their café are called 'Eurogames,' known for gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged. This idea evolved into 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. Pandemic, a Eurogame by North American designer Matt Leacock, is a popular example where players work together to solve global issues. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame based on Lord of the Rings. He recalls playing it with friends and feeling a range of emotions, wanting to create a similar experience.

Leacock's love for board games started in childhood, despite often feeling disappointed by them. With his uncle's help, he began redesigning games to make them better. Pandemic became a huge success, and its sequel added more storytelling, similar to video games, where characters develop and the world changes.

Interestingly, the growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games. Video games have made playing games more common, as many people now play games on their smartphones. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, notes that video and board games have learned from each other, and more people are open to playing games now.

Initially, video games offered social interaction in arcades or through multiplayer games at home. But as multiplayer games moved online, players became physically distant. This led some people to seek games they could play in person with others. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just entertainment. In our online world, these games offer a way to connect in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has been behind some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His journey shows why persistence is crucial in the music industry, even if your career starts with setbacks. Jamie's mother, a talented singer, introduced him to the guitar. Growing up, he only listened to a local radio station for older audiences, which influenced his musical tastes. He didn't hear a modern song until he was 12. Around that time, he had to choose between pursuing tennis, which he played at a national level, and music, as he spent his school lunchtimes playing piano. Although he was good at tennis, he realized it wasn't his passion. At 17, he left school to pursue music. He formed a duo with a friend who was a decent guitarist but not as committed to a music career. Jamie told his parents about his dream, explaining that he wrote lyrics during economics classes and played piano while others played outside. His father gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would need to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed by a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he parted ways with his friend. Ultimately, Jamie found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he switched to another to release a new album, but fame didn't come. He felt he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time as an artist, but as a songwriter, he was in the right place. Writing for others became his strength. Jamie believes he is one of the main writers UK labels rely on to help new artists start their careers. He sometimes explains to these artists that aiming for chart success is nothing to be ashamed of. He encourages them to create songs they love that also have the potential to sell well. Jamie is refreshingly honest about wanting to write hit songs. He isn't arrogant; he simply knows he has a talent for writing number-one hits. Instead of worrying about others' opinions, he focuses on his goal. When he works with someone in the studio, he aims to create music that can succeed globally and become classic modern pop songs."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He's very famous online but might be unknown to people who don't watch videos of bike stunts. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist,' which means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I met him for an interview at a BMX park, many local boys and even older people recognized him and called him a 'legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed with them. I was impressed by his bravery and creativity, even though I was skeptical at first. 

Tony explained each stunt before doing it, and I often doubted he could succeed. But he always did, though he seemed indifferent to my praise. Despite his online fame, Tony doesn't enjoy being a celebrity. He finds it hard to engage socially and prefers doing things rather than talking about them. This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. He acknowledges that this technology allows him to make a living from what would have been just a hobby in the past. 

From my experience interviewing top athletes, I've learned that two key factors turn a passionate child into a top competitor: energy and the ability to overcome emotional setbacks. These are often more important than talent and help athletes persist despite failures. In risky sports, mental strength is crucial. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on relatively easy obstacles but kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he's reckless. Tony responds that these critics don't understand the sport and haven't ridden a trials bike. They don't know the technical details or that he gets expert advice to minimize risks. Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He believes it's important to be aware of dangers. He divides people into those who can't overcome fear and those who can. He feels fear but finds a way to move past it. He's not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning and preparing. Before a new stunt, he rides around to get in the right mindset. He knows he must fully commit to succeed."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on several dangerous challenges for charity, like running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. Her latest challenge involved walking on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, just a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she quickly learned that high-wire walking was very different. ""The training was a shock,"" Helen said. ""I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she admitted afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole using skis, a kite, and a bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it for a holiday trip to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He spent ten days in a hostel bed with a serious fever and no medicine. He didn’t have money for hospital bills or to return home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that lets us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their population has decreased significantly, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat based on our findings. The work is challenging. There are four of us, each working six hours a day. We have studied ducks in various locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and record every duck I see. The weather has been difficult—some nights are mild, but more often it's wet. It's so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We've only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Despite the challenges, I enjoy it, especially compared to what summer will bring—long hours in a lab analyzing our results. It will be tough to be indoors, but it's necessary. I wouldn't change this experience for anything!"
59,"Whenever I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is crucial to ensure that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from the company I work for. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, and spend time selecting the best ones for our chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues, which makes them happy! My kitchen is filled with machines and ingredients for experimenting. It's great to have a private space to retreat to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm at our food lab, and other times I'm traveling abroad to buy raw materials. This can be challenging since I have a young family. However, I love the variety and unpredictability of the job, although the chocolate itself is still my favorite part! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things such as balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, ""For a circus career, performers need to avoid repeating the same acts – it's important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to succeed in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great aspect is the friendship with other performers and the opportunity to learn from them. Being fit is also crucial – circus artists, like athletes, train daily to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or only work a few months each year. But the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only perform while you're young, and then you need to think about other options."" The course also includes business planning. Many former students have started businesses worldwide and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, that it's not a profession for making money! ""The work usually means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive – but a lot of fun!"""
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you've probably heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers, but that's not true. They often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the true stars of the music industry! ""What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job!"" ""Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There's often no sheet music to follow. I'll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, plus an orchestra. I was terrified because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already."" ""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always know which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it."""
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion. She created a successful company selling 'satchels,' which are traditional school bags. These bags are now sold in famous stores and are popular with celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning, instead of just going with her first thought. Once she chose satchels, not everyone supported her decision. Julie recalls, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had no career experience but had a natural talent for business. The design inspiration came from children's storybooks. Although Julie wasn't familiar with fashion blogs, they played a crucial role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would mention them in their blogs. They did, and interest grew, as did the speed of production. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is spotted with a satchel. While other companies spend on online ads, she uses the internet community for fresh style ideas, keeping her products innovative. There was a tough time when another company copied her design to sell similar bags. As a result, she now ensures she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices, where people love working. There's a new factory now, and while the building is important, it's the team that makes it special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a talented swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with her schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky explained, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all – and when the excitement fades, there’s no point. Fortunately, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, bringing young people together as part of a larger group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people doubt whether celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it for their own publicity, which can overshadow the charity’s real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Ana Ronson, a singer-songwriter, grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but music was always present at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. Ana first sang in front of an audience at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to build her confidence. After some time in the club, Ana sang with 50 other students at a concert and felt happy doing it. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Although she was the youngest in the class, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher ignored her ideas, which inspired her to write ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She posted the song online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled across Ireland to invite her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn't know the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. Joss assured her this wouldn't happen, and soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and the event was a great success. Ana prefers writing songs about difficult times rather than when life is good because she feels there's more to express. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes fans enjoy her music, her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an incredible trip. I joined a guided group tour by boat along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry's idea. Like me, he's a journalist, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. Harry loves boats, but that's not something we have in common. However, I had always wanted to visit that area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew our great-grandparents had lived there before moving to Europe, so I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we planned to visit. Fortunately, the weather forecast predicted calm seas for when we would be there. I was busy with work and didn't have much time to think about the trip preparations. But Harry assured me he had taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

Once we arrived in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people lived along that coast, and indeed, the only other living creatures we saw on the first morning were dolphins and birds. There were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see them, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of amazing, colorful fish, many of which I didn't recognize. It was wonderful not to worry about time passing. We always made sure to have lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. Each evening, when we finally fell asleep on the boats, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to share our adventures with everyone at home!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. As a kid, I often went to watch his games. You might think this would make me love basketball, but it actually had the opposite effect. I enjoyed bragging to my friends about how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually brought a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session but felt I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. It took some convincing, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. Having my parents watch made me nervous, but it turned out fine in the end.

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did well, even joining an adult team. At fifteen, I moved to a special sports academy in the USA. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't enjoy being far from my parents at first. Back home, I didn't have much time for friends because of training, so that part wasn't new. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly.

I turned professional at eighteen, three years after moving to the USA. I had been taller than most professional players since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism in college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After looking at different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, making it feel new every time! After finishing my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that to get a license, I needed to know much more than I already did. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent guide. Tour guiding isn't just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. You also need to be entertaining, tell interesting stories, and adapt to changes, like if a place is unexpectedly closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour without hearing about problems. I need to ensure visitors are happy with my tours because they might leave reviews online. Good reviews are crucial as they attract more customers. That's why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy usually result in very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I'm 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Even though Josie is five years younger than me, we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first time doing something like this. However, we didn't need to worry. 

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard, but seeing the elephants enjoy their food made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants! 

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a room, so it was a bit cramped, but that was our choice because Josie didn't want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and vegetarian, which was great since neither of us likes meat. After dinner, we spent the evenings talking and playing games with the other volunteers and staff.

Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I'm not sure she's being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she realizes how lucky she was to have gone. Maybe she'll return one day—I definitely will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people for their homes or as gifts; we have a variety of customers. Hotels and offices often want flowers for their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often cold and dark, but that's expected at that hour, so it doesn't bother me. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I'd probably only pick pink ones because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what customers want can be different. Not all flowers are available year-round, so sometimes I can't find exactly what customers want.

I don't enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it's necessary. Flowers aren't cheap, so I have to get the best price I can. Back at the shop, we check customer orders and arrange the flowers I've bought. Then we create bouquets and calculate the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy figuring out how to make the nicest arrangements within a customer's budget. That's part of selling, and I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films, including many for kids on weekends. It's close to where I live. However, a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we pick a different location in the city each month. For instance, we once used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners earn money by selling snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We’re happy just to cover our costs – we’re not aiming to make a profit. Each time we show a film, things get a bit easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we've sold because everything is online, so we don't worry about empty seats anymore! There’s still a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great experience, it’s wonderful. Our website has been very helpful, and we’re now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We’ve visited them to see how they operate, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve also started a blog because most people now look online for film information instead of reading local paper reviews. We’ve tried putting up posters in cafés too. However, nothing beats word of mouth – people recommending us to their friends. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."
71,"As a child, taking photographs was my favorite activity. When I turned 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I decided to do something special. I started a personal project: taking one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I began. After a few weeks, I uploaded my photos to a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and share my work with others. I was surprised to find that people liked my perspective and photography style. I enjoyed capturing a variety of subjects. Someone suggested that my project would be better if all the photos had a common theme. I agreed and focused on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing, as they mostly used color. I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up several times. However, I trusted my instincts and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher, who told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges announced I had won first prize; I was thrilled because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough for a professional career. Now, I have my own photography studio and have never regretted my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because they offered activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking, which I had never tried before. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities to push yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you receive a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children's club for two hours a week as my first challenge. I was unsure about this because I had been a member of that club when I was eight and had trouble making friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to accept the challenge because I wanted to earn my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I found myself wanting to spend all my free time at the children's club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. After completing the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had formed strong relationships with the children. Now, I volunteer there for about four hours a week and always look forward to it. 

Thanks to my experience at the children's club, I have decided that after finishing school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. This was not something I had considered before joining the club. In fact, I had never thought about my future career, and youth work had never crossed my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have earned several other NYC certificates now, including one for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I did well. After that, I quickly grew to love the sport and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my passion for competing and winning has only grown stronger, which motivates me to push myself. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes it works out well, like when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn't sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That success boosted my confidence in my abilities. In the summer, I focus on training and studying since there's no snow. I train every day, but it's nice not to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with friends, which helps me cope with not being able to snowboard. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also want to have another option in case I don't succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I'm considering becoming a doctor if I can balance it with my active lifestyle. I can't imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can't do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had and didn't think about the future. For instance, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I'm grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I found it surprisingly easy, even though it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it was boring, but I was excited about it. Mum showed me how to make beautiful things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewelry to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. I needed to know if they were good enough for the public, so I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists visit where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewelry to take home as gifts. Soon, we got calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but it was just the two of us at a market stall! That's when I realized it could work, and it was time to create a website. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, although we still have our stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called ""Being Amelia,"" which became a bestseller. The book is partly inspired by Janine's own life. In an interview, Janine explained that because her father's job required the family to move frequently, she became skilled at making new friends. This experience helped her write about Amelia, the main character, adjusting to a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia's home life, especially her interactions with her older brother. Since Janine is an only child, she had to use her imagination to write those parts.

Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she had won first prize in a short story competition on a young writers' website. This success made the publishing company eager to read ""Being Amelia"" when she sent it to them. They loved it, and a year later, the book was available in stores.

A review of ""Being Amelia"" notes that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters in the story face real challenges, which makes them believable to readers. The reviewer also mentions that despite Janine's young age and the book's short length, she has proven to be a better writer than many bestselling authors.

Janine is still adjusting to her fame as a writer. She said, ""At first, I hid when people recognized me on the street, but now it's OK. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, spending time with friends always gives me new ideas to write about!"""

77,"I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I've always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby—birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local young birdwatchers' club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I've almost reached that because, on family holidays abroad, I've had the chance to see birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I've been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I might see my 200th species. I wasn't too disappointed when it didn't happen, though, as I've learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it fascinating and commented on it. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn't feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I'm lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn't have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a decent player. My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and a referee noticed I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. She was impressed and invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first—I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13. I improved a lot after that. Even so, some people doubted I’d become a star player, which made me a bit upset. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever because I didn’t want the other players to blame me if we lost. By pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach’s advice to me—you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few bad times, though, so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"In recent years, both in the UK and internationally, there has been a significant shift in further and higher education to involve students in research early in their studies. This change acknowledges that research is not just for renowned scholars or scientists at prestigious universities. Instead, research is a fundamental way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only in academics but also in the workplace, as they help us think critically about the world and our work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by creating it, not just by learning and repeating it. This involves asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can range from groundbreaking, complex studies by highly trained experts to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questioning. Most students have engaged in some form of research, whether in school projects or everyday tasks like planning a holiday or fixing things at home. In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, critically evaluating information, and forming your own ideas are expected learning activities.

Some students might find this challenging, especially if they come from educational backgrounds where knowledge is seen as fixed and authority figures are not questioned. However, in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authority is encouraged. This approach might seem daunting, but critical thinking is crucial in research. We need to engage with others' research, think critically about it, and test its validity. It's important not to accept information blindly but to assess whether it is logical, reasoned, and supported by evidence."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, London coffee houses were places where people discussed topics like chemistry and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities are creative hubs, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. 

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. It's known that city life is tiring, but new research shows that it can also dull our thinking. One major issue is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for our brains. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they offer a mental break from the busy city life.

This research is timely because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we are packed into concrete jungles with millions of strangers. These unnatural environments affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy city street requires our brains to manage many distractions, like other pedestrians and traffic. This constant need to focus drains our mental energy because the brain has to decide what to pay attention to and what to ignore.

In contrast, natural settings don't demand as much mental effort. This concept is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied these effects, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the impact of city life and sought ways to bring nature into urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer city dwellers a break from urban life. A well-designed park can quickly improve brain function. While people try various methods to boost cognitive performance, like energy drinks or office redesigns, simply walking in nature seems to be more effective.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain centers of intellectual life. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that challenge our attention, like crowded streets, also promote innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities drives creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a hub of intellectual breakthroughs, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of technological innovation. Less crowded cities might produce less innovation over time.

The challenge is to reduce the psychological stress of city life while keeping its benefits. After all, there are times when people crave the excitement of the city over the calm of nature."
81,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious to say that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to support this idea. However, I believe the study of the mind shouldn't be limited to just the brain. There is plenty of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in human thinking. Archaeology shows us that items like stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and shaping the mind. So, I propose that what is outside the head might still be part of the mind.

It's easy to see why people equate the mind with the brain. Most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their usual surroundings. This approach makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limitations of brain-scanning machines. However, it often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny the importance of the brain in cognition, but I suggest that the mind extends beyond the brain into culture and the material world.

This is where my theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become extensions of our minds, like when we use clay to make numbers or a stone to create a tool. It also looks at how these interactions have changed over time and what they mean for our thinking. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they are shaped by the things around us.

Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does their sense of self begin? The stick becomes part of their body, showing how minds and objects can be continuous. This example also highlights the flexibility of the human mind: the stick helps the blind person turn touch into sight. The brain treats the stick as part of the body, reminding us that human intelligence is adaptable and can incorporate new technologies.

I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, from early stone tools to the internet, tools have served as pathways for exploration and understanding, not just boundaries. Unlike a monkey using a stick to get food, humans use tools to satisfy our curiosity. This unique human trait explains why we create things and how those things, in turn, shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world.

I want to emphasize the role of material objects in shaping our cognition. MET provides a new way to understand how different forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern technology, have defined and transformed our thinking. While ""mind-changing technology"" might sound futuristic, humans have been using it since our species first evolved."
82,"Photography has significantly changed how we understand the world and has greatly influenced civilization, especially in the United States. In the U.S., photography quickly became a part of culture at all levels, from practical and scientific uses to industrial and artistic ones. It also opened up new forms of entertainment. Historians argue that photography might be the U.S.'s greatest contribution to the visual arts, as no other art form has been as influential. To fully appreciate its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Photography was appealing for several reasons. First, it was a mechanical process, which matched the growing enthusiasm for technology in the U.S., a country that embraced change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world feel smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with stunning immediacy. Second, the camera became the preferred tool for representing oneself, as it could present an image for public view in a country where personal and national identities were constantly being created and recreated. Third, the camera was important for creating and preserving family memories, even if these were somewhat idealized. Lastly, the realistic nature of photographs aligned with the U.S. artists' tendency towards realism and depicting everyday life.

Photographs draw attention to what the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""This, you should see!"" Because they are made by a machine, photographs are records of events, people, and things, providing a sense of objectivity. However, since they are taken by individuals, they also carry a subjective point of view. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, but photographic meaning is more complex. No image is presented without some context that influences our understanding, like a newspaper caption or its placement in a gallery.

To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and function within its cultural context: Why was it made? How was it first seen? The same image can appear in different places and times, changing its meaning each time. The camera's importance to artists was once a secret, but now it is widely recognized. Since the time of U.S. artist Andy Warhol, who used photographs in his art, artists have been incorporating photographs in various ways. Photographic vision has become an essential part of art, complementing painting and shaping our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some understanding of what this means. However, even though we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains a complex concept. James, like most psychologists, was mainly interested in human psychology. He believed it involved basic elements: thoughts and feelings, a physical world existing in time and space, and a way of understanding these things. This understanding is personal and private, coming from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and may not always align with scientific facts. 

We often act as amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex psychological topics, like whether brainwashing works, or when we explain why people behave in certain ways, such as feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems arise when people have different interpretations. Formal psychology aims to provide methods to determine which explanations are most likely correct in a given situation. Psychologists help us distinguish between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and objective facts. 

Psychology, as defined by James, is about the mind or brain. Although psychologists study the brain, they don't fully understand its role in our hopes, fears, and behaviors. It's challenging to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming hypotheses about internal processes. Scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not directly observable like an engine's. They must be inferred from behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, using clues derived from careful observation and analysis. 

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control or modify processes. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply findings to improve lives. Psychological research has been useful in areas like teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people communicate their feelings better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to study mental structures. However, introspection has limitations, as it only reveals a small part of brain activity. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a typical business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, showcases products that were taken off the market because almost no one wanted to buy them. Examples include A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, believes each product tells a sad story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business, which is unexpected because you might think companies would keep their own collections of failed products. However, many executives visit the museum because they often avoid thinking about their failures and don't keep samples of their unsuccessful products.

The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, began collecting a sample of every new product he could find in the 1960s, intending to create a 'reference library' of consumer products, not specifically failures. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection naturally became filled with unsuccessful ones.

Today's culture of optimism might explain why these failed products exist. Each product likely went through meetings where no one realized it was doomed. Even if they did, marketers might have continued investing in the product to force some sales and save face. Little effort is made to understand what went wrong, and people involved often avoid discussing the failures.

This focus on optimism is common in the growing 'self-help' industry, where 'positive visualization' is popular. The idea is that if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to do so. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot suggests that our brains might be wired to see the chances of success as higher than they are. Her research indicates that well-balanced people tend to have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied the effectiveness of 'positive fantasies about the future.' They found that thinking too much about how well things could go can actually reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people who imagined having a very successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our response to failure is influenced by our beliefs about ability. People with a 'fixed theory' mindset think ability is innate, while those with an 'incremental theory' believe it develops through effort and challenges. Fixed-theory individuals see failure as proof they lack ability, like a sports star who relies on being a 'natural' and doesn't practice enough. Incremental-theory individuals view failure as a sign they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, regardless of success."
85,"Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? We might think we know, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the traditional idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists are exploring what helps players perform at their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, financial interests question if home advantage should matter at all, as players are paid well and should perform well anywhere. 

What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their support is crucial for the team. Fans often think their cheering leads to goals, but they forget the times when their noise didn't result in success. 

However, one fan belief is supported by science: home fans influence referees. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This matches real-life decisions, suggesting referees avoid making calls that would anger the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in luxury, and stadiums are more similar. Despite these changes, home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball focuses more on individual matchups, while basketball relies on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home.

Another factor could be players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This might relate to a primal urge to defend home territory. In the recent Rugby World Cup, underdog teams playing at home won against stronger opponents, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"""The more I practise, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous in sports and valued by dedicated athletes and their coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with claims for other golfers of that time. Its meaning is also intriguing. Player didn't mean ""lucky"" literally; he was speaking ironically. His real message was, ""The more I practise, the better I get."" But how much better can one get through practice alone? This question is central to the nature-nurture debate in sports: is talent something you're born with, or can it be developed?

The debate isn't balanced; nurture, or practice, has been seen as more important than natural talent. This idea is largely based on psychologist Anders Ericsson's theory that becoming an expert in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice. This theory inspired books like Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers"" and others like ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" These books generally conclude that practice is the key to success, suggesting that 10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert.

However, in his book, Epstein argues that this isn't always true. He points out a flaw in studies on excellence: they often only look at successful people. Science is better at analyzing why an elite athlete succeeds after the fact. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities while others don't, considering both innate traits and factors like environment, support, and determination.

Epstein's search for answers takes him worldwide, from Kenya to Sweden, the Caribbean to the Arctic, and even beyond human achievements. In Alaska, he learns that the key to winning the toughest sled dog race might be the husky dogs' drive and desire, suggesting a link between genetics and traits we think are voluntary. This challenges the idea that commitment and determination are purely choices. What if, as with the huskies, an individual's drive also has a genetic component?

These examples highlight the complexity of the topic. Epstein distinguishes between ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture) and agrees that in elite athletes, both are essential. He doesn't dismiss the importance of training or environment, suggesting that if Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. But Epstein also examines cases where genetics are crucial and can't be ignored. He also looks at race and gender issues, asking, ""If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?"" Sometimes, the most obvious questions are the most important."
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature. This idea matches other discussions about modern childhood. A follow-up study found that many children would be happier if they could spend more time outside. People over 40 often remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they played outside freely, which they believe was healthier than the protected lives of today's children. However, they don't often realize that they are the ones who have created these protective environments for their kids, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book includes strong arguments. She discusses how fear of outdoor dangers and consumerism keep children indoors, benefiting the toy and gadget industry. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. While some of these practices might be exaggerated, Griffiths expresses her views passionately. She also talks about childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules. Although her arguments are appealing, Griffiths sometimes takes them too far, ignoring important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems extreme.

Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children, often seeing them in an idealized way. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks, learning from small accidents to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children may want the adventurous life she describes. Some children are naturally timid and prefer staying at home. Perhaps the real issue is forcing all children into the same mold, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I've spent a lot of time in school. I'm good at solving problems in my work and life, but this isn't because of my schooling. Most life problems can't be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those with more to learn play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how mammals, including humans, have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, moral lives can't be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is crucial for economic success. We don't need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate obstacles, we'll have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam and catching it, then thinking about the consequences. We can't teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling focused on imposed questions with one right answer. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring for them, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit anytime. If you can't quit, it's not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue the game. This makes play the most democratic activity. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and pressure for high grades has grown. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults present have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene rather than let children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant, caused by social factors like parents' fears, expert warnings about dangers, declining neighborhood cohesion, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children don't need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the negative trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They need to follow their natural drives to play and explore to grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow direct contact with potential employers, similar to standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, this access also increases the risk of mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to use her contacts to get a job. The executive, offended by this request from a stranger, not only rejected him but also sent a harsh, sarcastic reply that went viral. Many who saw the note online were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone, though not the message. This incident highlights the importance of using social media carefully in a professional context. Social media can be risky for job seekers who misuse it, and many are making mistakes. 

Ironically, social media has been central to the social lives of twentysomethings for years. For my generation, it was a way to escape from parents and teachers, a place to impress and experiment. It was often based on fantasy, where you could chat with someone online and ignore them in person. You could change your image overnight with the right Facebook posts. But using social media for professional networking is different, and our familiarity with platforms like Facebook might be a disadvantage. We learned to be bold and confident online, which might explain why some still think this works professionally. Just because your Facebook posts were popular doesn't mean LinkedIn will help you impress employers. We need to understand that our teenage social media habits don't apply in the professional world, and we must meet employers' expectations to succeed.

Employers often complain that young job seekers on professional sites are too informal and seem arrogant, reinforcing the stereotype of an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are desperate for jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This perceived arrogance can harm their job prospects, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees. So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly introduce yourself and explain what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of a positive response. Avoid sending generic emails and keep your tone humble to prevent a negative reaction. Remember, social media can help you make valuable connections, but it requires careful use to avoid closing doors."
90,"Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If someone claims they can do it accurately, they might not be truthful. Looking at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre found that only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people predict that printed newspapers will disappear in about 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist wrongly predicted that books and theatre would become obsolete, but they have survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived even with TV, and cinema has stayed popular despite videos and DVDs. Vinyl records have even made a comeback, with a 745% increase in online sales since 2008.

Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. It was also because people started to believe that everything is always changing and they needed regular updates, a concept that was unfamiliar in medieval times. Back then, people only noticed the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life was seen as cyclical, with recurring truths, as writer Alain de Botton explains.

Journalism as a full-time job only really started in the 19th century. Even then, there was no clear reason why people needed news regularly. The regular publication of newspapers can be limiting. Online news allows readers to check updates based on their interests and the importance of events. Advanced search engines and algorithms let us customize news to our preferences. Online news can provide minute-by-minute updates and correct errors quickly. There are no space limits, so stories can be detailed, and full documents can be accessed. This is very different from traditional newspapers.

However, many online news providers focus on being the first to report news, getting reader comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we are returning to that kind of world. Newspapers have not always been great at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction, or they might find a way to help us understand our complex world, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic universe, as de Botton suggests."
91,"If humans were naturally comfortable under the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many nocturnal animals do. However, we are creatures of the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a fundamental part of our genetics, even if we don't often think of ourselves as daytime beings, just as we don't constantly consider ourselves primates or mammals. This explains why we've altered the night by filling it with artificial light. This control over our environment is similar to building a dam on a river. While it has benefits, it also brings problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just beginning to study. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, where artificial light spreads outward and upward into the sky instead of being directed downward where it's needed. This poorly designed lighting brightens the night, disrupting the natural light levels and rhythms that many life forms, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would have been meaningless. Imagine approaching London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's largest city. Nearly a million people lived there, relying on candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and public gaslights wouldn't appear for another seven years. From a distance, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We've illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that's far from true. Among mammals alone, many species are nocturnal. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. It's so powerful that scientists describe songbirds and seabirds as being 'captured' by searchlights on land or gas flares on marine oil platforms, circling until they fall. Birds migrating at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, with young birds on their first journey being most affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours due to artificial light. It was once thought that light pollution only troubled astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need an unobstructed view of the night sky, but like most creatures, we do need darkness. Ignoring the need for darkness is pointless. It's as crucial for our biological health as light is; disrupting our internal clock can lead to various health issues. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping in our lives mirrors the Earth's cycle of light and dark. These rhythms are so essential to us that disturbing them is like changing our center of gravity. Ultimately, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs near a brightly lit highway. Living in our own artificial glare, we've disconnected from our evolutionary and cultural heritage—the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us lose sight of our true place in the universe, forgetting our scale, which is best understood against the vastness of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently announced that his company will stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This decision was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by someone from his media team. While the announcement might seem like an attempt to make the company appear more caring, we should consider if the idea is practical.

The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn't harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads. In a large company, it's harder to be sure that taking time off won't affect the business.

The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work is up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? Even if you prepare before a holiday, work will pile up while you're away. This is just how taking leave works. Employees might end up not taking any leave or feeling guilty if they do. This guilt can lead to stress and lower productivity over time.

There could also be pressure from colleagues about who takes time off and for how long. In the corporate world, there's already a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. Without the security of legally guaranteed leave, people might feel they can't take the time off they need without seeming lazy.

Modern technology blurs the line between work and free time, as we can receive work messages anywhere. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees questioned how the new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours accurately, why should it apply an outdated standard to time off? However, without set working hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might feel they are always being watched, leading them to self-monitor in a harmful way.

Employment laws exist to ensure workers get a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like increased morale and productivity, can happen without affecting worker well-being. Therefore, I doubt that allowing employees to take as much holiday as they want is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper before it is published. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research by preventing flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. This process can delay publication by up to a year, raising the question of whether this delay is worth it to ensure trust in scientific literature. The answer is both yes and no, as this issue highlights the changing nature of scientific publishing.

While I still believe in some form of review before formal publication, the landscape is shifting. Preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review, are becoming more common. They allow for the quick sharing of new research so it can be read, critiqued, and built upon. However, publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which can lead to authors cutting corners and reviewers focusing more on whether a paper is suitable for a prestigious journal rather than its scientific quality.

These issues are well-known, but few are willing to change the current system. Preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a drastic change from the norm. Despite being around for twenty years, preprints haven't been widely adopted due to scientists' conservative nature and the misconception that journals won't accept papers already posted as preprints. There's also a fear that publishing without peer review could lead to an increase in poor-quality science, though this hasn't happened yet.

Preprints are open to critique and discussion by a global community, which can be beneficial. For example, Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, found that posting a preprint allowed for open discussion and critique, which isn't always possible with traditional journals. Preprints also allow for the sharing of negative results, an important part of science often overlooked by journals focused on new discoveries. Additionally, papers on preprint archives are read and cited more, showing the effectiveness of this method of sharing research.

By embracing the internet's culture of openness and collaboration, preprints can help shift the focus back to the quality of the work itself, rather than where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say it's like 'a painting in words.' These answers usually don't satisfy either of us. So, one day, I asked them to pick an object and write two paragraphs: one describing it like a scientist, and another from the object's perspective, titled 'Poem.' One student wrote: 

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I'm a device that helps people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and even then, only for a short time. Most people will never need me. 

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to laughter and meaningful discussion. 

When I was in school, poetry often seemed confusing to me. I thought of each poem as a complicated puzzle that blocked true understanding and emotion. After school, many people find poetry less engaging. Sometimes, you come across a poem, and it stands out because it's not like regular prose. It almost challenges you to read it, and often, you feel let down by its simplicity or because it’s hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we expect from poems? Aren't they supposed to hold deep emotions, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem to be yes. But if we want to cry, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels offer us worlds to escape to, paintings give us visual pleasure, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. 

However, one thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life is full of it, unlike straightforward reading. But these thoughts still don't explain what a poem truly is. If you search online for 'poem,' it redirects to 'poetry': 'a form of literary art using the aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language.' This is academic language, but it hides the word's origins. 'Poem' comes from the Greek 'poí?ma,' meaning 'a thing made,' and a poet is 'a maker of things.' So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? 

Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – precise and human-made – depending on their perspective. But these comparisons don't hold up under scrutiny. The value in trying to define a poem through comparison is not in the comparison itself but in the discussion it sparks. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps the mind explore new ways of thinking and see ordinary things differently. 

Thinking of a poem as a mental object isn't hard, especially when we consider how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody has a strong effect, like schoolyard rhymes such as 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.' But aren't words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Consider a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, staring at you: A poem can impact you like nothing else, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is created through writing and rewriting, just like an article, story, or novel, but it never really becomes a commodity. Publishing houses send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to cover printing costs. A poem presents itself not as a market product, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after getting married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been wiser to spend it on something practical for the house. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has brought me joy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot known for old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I almost ignored it but couldn't resist checking. I dug half a meter down and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden object. I tried not to get too excited, thinking it might be brass like before. But as I cleared the dirt, it turned out to be a beautifully patterned loop. I stopped and stared, realizing it looked like the Great Torc in the British Museum, a famous piece from Iron Age Britain over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a twisted gold and silver necklace with gold rings at each end, just like what I found.

I took it to the car and couldn't stop looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in the kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. I called Marion, saying, ""I've got something for you."" She came in, stopped, and asked, ""What is it?"" I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on, fearing it might get damaged. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe, but anxiety kept me awake. Eventually, I hid it under a floorboard in my office.

The law requires reporting such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before handing it over, even taking it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned, stopped mid-sentence, and stared. The torc was authenticated and sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find; it's something I've preserved for the nation. People ask if I'll stop detecting now that I've found something so amazing. But those brooches and coins are still fascinating. Like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I won't stop while there's a chance of finding something even bigger."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite parts of traveling, but I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When friends describe their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian sheets. Better sleep is a happy bonus of traveling. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—over 12 hours most days. Even with noisy birds nearby, it didn't bother me. Away from home, in a new environment, I could sleep deeply and dream more vividly than I thought possible. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I don't think just relaxing explains why travel sleep feels so different. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we encounter new sights, sounds, and smells. We absorb different cultures, music, and landscapes. Sleep helps us process all this new information. That's why sleep feels more intense when traveling. Sleep also changes with each place. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. In Trinidad, for example, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to adjust to this new sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, where I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all relaxed on hammocks and sofas. I finally understood the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I didn't just sleep; I experienced a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is memorable. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my dreams. If 'slow travel'—fully enjoying each experience rather than rushing—is what defines the modern traveler, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said diplomatically to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking a bit like a bulldog. ""But it's so boring,"" she said. ""Everyone will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little one will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black mini top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she decided, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing, someone they knew nothing about. Her husband Jeff had been quick to comment when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff said when Mia told him, ""What kind of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" ""Sounds pretentious,"" Jeff retorted. He disliked anything showy and didn't believe in being overly polite, which he called Mia’s reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn’t have hesitated to tell the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said a trash can lid would suit her better. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and entered Medlar House through the back door; her commute was just forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends who struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions that there was definitely a demand. She was right. From the start, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where she offered a relaxed environment to try on as many hats as needed. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure everything matched. Recently, she expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It's a long journey from London to Atlanta, and Lawrence Okoye is reflecting on his incredible sports career. He is confident, yet even he is a bit surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Despite never having played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be selected by a top USA team. In Atlanta, he is still learning the details of his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London, who is new to the sport, could be chosen for one of the biggest teams in American sports seems unbelievable. But Lawrence is used to overcoming doubts. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but delayed it to focus on discus, after previously playing rugby. Within 20 months, he became the world's fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, aiming for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in a potential NFL contract, he confirms, ""American football was in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I had thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then."" Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ""Pretty much,"" he says. ""I went online and applied."" Was he nervous about competing with experienced American football players? ""No,"" he says. ""I don't get nervous about many things."" He doesn't talk much, but his confidence is clear. His performance in various tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ""I was very pleased to hear that,"" he admits, showing a rare hint of pride. However, he is also cautious. Without any basic experience, how can he make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have all the necessary attributes. It's just about how hard I work,"" he explains. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he's been selected? ""I am. There's no pressure on me. Many people say I'll definitely be selected, but I'm not too worried."" This calm attitude might come from his disappointing Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved past this and is proud that he made it to the final with an impressive last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he recalls. ""The final didn't go as I wanted, but that's part of sports. It's something I can return to."" After his Olympic setback, some thought the experience had affected him. Lawrence doesn't comment on this. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his great physical abilities, wouldn't it be better to focus on one sport? ""I understand why someone would say that,"" he replies. ""I'm trying to achieve something I've dreamed about since I was a schoolkid. If it doesn't work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I've made has been well thought out."""
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, it hadn't started snowing in Siberia yet. There was no sign of human life, just an endless view of mountains, streams, and forests. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow, traveling to remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I managed to explain that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he reasoned, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it anymore. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and said ""Holodna"" (cold), pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I didn't mention that my trip was self-funded and I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at discounted prices. I wasn't sure they would be up to the task, especially my large postman's over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats, some taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me slouched Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to decipher my scrawl, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job ticked many important boxes for me. It was frequently challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. Ever since that first ride we took together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times, he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could handle each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the skeptics who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to participate. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed I was healthy, and the second required me to empty my pockets because small objects can become dangerous during the flight. I learned I needed to stay oriented by keeping an eye on the horizon. The pilot would tell me where to look. I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. 

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. As we taxied down the runway, I tried not to touch the steering pedals with my feet or the switches with my hands. My mind was made up: I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense up and relax at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea. This was not comforting as we started accelerating down the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we made a sharp right turn. It was a sudden, intense move, and I felt the air squeeze out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned sharply left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for the small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my brief excitement was interrupted by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even started the acrobatics yet. 

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too—it’s that responsive. Then Dario said something. I asked him to repeat it, but instead, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was a bit much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience during a race. To prove the point, Dario got out some sandwiches as soon as we landed and started eating happily. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed of doing loops over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films animals in cold places. If you've ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a documentary, it was likely filmed by him. He prefers temperatures around -18C. Allan started as a marine biologist and commercial diver, which taught him how to survive in cold environments. His career took off when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to film a wildlife documentary. He helped them find locations and realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him because it combined travel, adventure, and underwater filming. Now, he is a leading cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series.

Allan says he started at a good time because few people had been to Antarctica then. There were experts for different animals, like coral or elephants, but he became known for filming in cold places. Back then, camera technology was basic. It’s easier to film now with digital technology because you can shoot a lot and review it immediately. In the past, film was expensive, so you had to plan your shots carefully. 

Allan's strength is his experience in cold conditions. He feels comfortable on sea ice, like crossing a street. He admits to getting cold toes but says the poles are healthy places without leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes. Wildlife filming has its successes and failures. Once, he went to the Orkneys to film kittiwakes but couldn’t identify them.

Recently, Allan filmed in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, known for polar bears and difficult conditions. It’s usually -32C in April, with strong winds and deep snow. After 23 days of watching polar bear dens, he had only seen one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, he felt in tune with the bears. He describes waiting by a hole and finally seeing a bear emerge, followed by her cubs. It was a special moment, like having front-row seats to a show.

Allan now wants to make a film about climate change in the Arctic, focusing on the people who live there and experience its effects. He believes he could create an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting supplies along the way. This meant he had to swim through freezing waters and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more challenging expedition. Explorers are confident and driven, and Pen is no exception. This time, however, the stakes are higher. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer journey to the North Pole to measure the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be crucial for scientists. This will provide the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was cared for by his father's old nanny, who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She toughened him up by sending him out into blizzards with minimal clothing. His father also passed on a love for icy adventures, and Pen showed remarkable physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman who says he has a ""spine of steel"" and shares his love for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he's at home, saying, ""He's in more danger driving along the A303 because in his head, he's somewhere in the Arctic."" For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horseback compete against runners. Mary and her horse finished an hour ahead of Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ""It's much harder to be away from them this time,"" he admits. ""They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in how I said goodbye. I told my son, 'You're the man of the house now, look after your mum and sister.' He took it seriously, but it was too much pressure. It was well-intentioned but unfair."" For similar reasons, he plans to have little contact with them while in the Arctic. ""If you call them, you remind them how far away you are."" He is spending his last days before departure preparing his gear meticulously. ""On the ice, you can't fix things or do anything that's not straightforward,"" he says. Joining him will be Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will have a support crew of six flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for someone like Pen, and he has other concerns too. ""I'm turning 47 on Thursday. I've done less training than I'd like."" Why? ""Organizational tasks always seem more urgent. So I'm almost afraid of what I'll ask of myself."" Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the quest for knowledge that inspired past explorers. ""Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,"" he admits, ""and not very useful beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we're engaging as many people as possible in what's happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,"" he says. ""Our skills, which seemed odd and unnecessary, are now very relevant. Suddenly, we're useful to society again."""
103,"I took a year off and wondered what to do next. Being an Olympian is amazing, and I had opportunities to write, work on TV, and speak at schools and businesses. Despite these activities, I missed having a competitive challenge. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to compete in the Olympics again, so I started running marathons and doing triathlons. But there was still Ben Fogle's invitation in my mind: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed the feeling of the boat gliding through water, but I wasn't ready for intense training every day. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but none were interested. I knew if I joined, I would want to win, and I wasn't sure if Ben was the best partner for that. However, the idea of being an underdog with no pressure was appealing. Ben was already planning to do the race and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the costs, which were high—£70,000 for the boat and equipment alone. We thought we had a good chance, but it would require effort to secure everything. Besides the race expenses, I also had to consider the loss of income from being away. Speaking at business conferences is a lucrative way for retired athletes to earn money, and while it's flattering, I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Joining the race meant I could talk about something current: rowing across the Atlantic. Planning this adventure taught me to appreciate the simpler life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but straightforward, with set training programs and support from doctors and dieticians. I worried about how people would perceive me racing with a TV presenter, fearing it might seem like I just wanted TV exposure. But during our preparations, those concerns faded. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about mental strength than just rowing skills. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island, but he couldn't row well. I was surprised by his lack of natural rowing ability, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have expected his skill level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty, maybe as a reaction to the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, deep in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to over 100. Recently, they took over a second property, the 'wilderness farm', which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They said I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.' I started packing right away.

November 6, London On my flight, I stare at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies; I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and panicky. I put the page down and look out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of blooming flowers and leaves. But I think I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests of thin conifers, heavy with snow, stopping occasionally to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely through the door when I’m given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes a wall of noise by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, harnessing the huskies to sleds. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, eager to start. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much anyway. I stand on the sidelines and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command rings out, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a discouraging questioning about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m stumped. I don’t know. Am I? Further questions reveal that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become difficult in sub-zero conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around by overenthusiastic huskies. But I am triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her incredible run. Her time was so fast that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after a training accident where she ran into a bike. Radcliffe says the achievement didn't really sink in at the time. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits.

During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried she might not keep up the pace and could drop out. Hartmann was angry at this, though he admitted that anyone who didn't know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers at a very fast speed but still managed to sprint the final distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run quicker than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would come close to that time soon, but Radcliffe thought, ""I'm going to come back and do it next year."" Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

After the race, people wondered how an athlete with such an awkward running style could beat the graceful East African runners. Hartmann had spent weeks with Radcliffe, giving her daily sessions to help with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle that level of pain like her. She would push me to go so deep into her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward."" Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to her training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for pleasantries; she was ready for a two-hour session. Radcliffe would push him to give everything he had, which made her so good. During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful.

Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ""Not really. I trained really hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought it might happen with Mary Keitany (a two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves."" What does she mean? ""That mental way of never easing up, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me to it because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always: 'keep pushing as hard as you can.'"" Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run as fast again. However, she left a lasting legacy, inspiring many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cookery show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" was released, I was unsure how viewers and critics would react. At the time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our series was a fresh and innovative addition to this movement. However, I was concerned whether people would appreciate a cooking approach that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science. I watched the first episode with a mix of excitement and anxiety. Fortunately, I had nothing to worry about. The show's success led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether exploring the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. These journeys were often physical, involving travel with passports and suitcases. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet extraordinary artisans, like a man dedicated to making the best-tasting golden pasta. These people have spent years pursuing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was challenging, and I knew some people would be disappointed if their favorites were left out. I imagined people asking, ""Where's steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?"" However, after a long meeting, the TV team and I created a list that had something for everyone. This confirmed my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, influenced by emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book's title, I never claimed the recipes were 'definitive.' But I thought that by using my technical skills and scientific knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying ideas and refining them until they become unique. The TV series allowed me to explore foods, people, and places I hadn't encountered before, which was as exciting as exploring memory and nostalgia in food. I began my career in this way, searching for the best ingredients took me around the world. Some adventures included visiting a canning factory that processed the wrong type of tomato and a dairy farm with low standards where we had to stop filming. Perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow to make ice cream with dry ice, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanner, and nearly setting my house on fire trying to heat the oven for a Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a few hours away from Marrakech when the van suddenly made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out to check the engine, looking like he knew what he was doing. But after a while, he admitted, ""Actually, I have no idea what I'm doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried and said, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was vast, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was usually best to be on her side. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. John went off to find someone who could help with the van, and Mum lay on the grass. ""Tell us a story,"" she said. Bea lay down next to her, and I started telling them about how I heard two birds talking the day before we left London. I told them about the things the birds discussed, like breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and a fight over a worm. Bea said, ""That's silly, no one understands bird language."" I insisted I did, but my voice wasn't convincing. ""Liar,"" she said, and I felt embarrassed. I wasn't sure anymore if I had really understood the birds. I looked to Mum for support, but she had fallen asleep. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped push the van to a hotel. Bea didn't want to get out, but the boys didn't mind and waved at her. We followed John into a café near where the van was parked. ""It's a hotel,"" John whispered, ""It might be expensive."" Mum said we'd just have tea, and we sat on the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum said, ""It's like syrup."" We stayed there all day while John tried to fix the van. ""It's a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on solid ground. John said he'd have to get us towed into Marrakech. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John driving it. Bea didn't want to move at first, so John carried her into the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we'd get home since the van needed towing. I thought maybe we could take a boat straight to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike Lucy, they weren't competing. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, but Lucy didn't catch her name clearly over the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing, their recent travels, and their future plans. 

Lucy mentioned she might be going to the Tanglewood festival that summer, which sounded impressive. However, she didn't really want to go. She often felt this way about the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, causing her to miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. Lucy hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad celebrated by buying her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant, and her little brother Gus dreamed of attending the festival himself one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. 

The thing was, Lucy hadn't applied to the festival herself. Her mother had filled out the application and sent in a CD. Her mom said she didn't want Lucy to be disappointed if she didn't get in. Lucy thought it was more about not giving her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn't even think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward, surprised. ""Tanglewood?"" he asked. ""Yeah,"" Lucy replied. ""How old are you?"" he asked. ""Fifteen,"" she said. He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy hadn't meant to brag. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was just fitting in or showing off. ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying..."" she explained. Liesel/Louisa excused herself, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, ""Have you ever been to Japan?"" He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were rebels. ""Once, when I was about eight,"" Lucy replied. He was about to say something when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,"" he said, taking her arm and pulling her away. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition."" ""They're not the competition,"" Lucy said. ""Everyone is the competition,"" her grandfather replied.

He took her around the room, introducing her to people he thought were important. Lucy smiled and nodded, only half-listening. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ""You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" Lucy liked that part—being somebody. Even if it made some people jealous or think she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn't earn her any special respect from the kids she used to go to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro perfectly. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Dad said, ""Spending too much time online isn't good for you. You need to experience the real world."" It's hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about this topic, and it's quite interesting. Research generally shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity and belonging, and are developing important technical skills needed for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is now a key part of growing up. Teenagers don't just use media occasionally like adults do; they live in it. It's not about whether it's good or bad, but how you use it that matters.

Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, compares social networking to what our parents did at our age. He says it's like a modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where parents used to share jokes and gossip. It helps teenagers develop their identity away from their parents and learn to interact with peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson explains that adolescence is a time of self-discovery, and social networking can help with that. It allows teenagers to share their interests and learn about different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are less self-centered than those who don't use social media. He also mentions that social media can be helpful for shy people, as online communication can be less intimidating than face-to-face interactions.

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can be beneficial for quiet individuals with specific interests, as they allow them to connect with others who share those interests. For example, if only a few people at your school like a certain type of music, you might feel isolated. But finding a group online with similar interests can make you feel more connected and popular in a different way.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says that young people who find new interests online and create their own content are truly using the potential of social networks. She believes social networking is becoming a creative force, with teenagers making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are also enhancing creativity, allowing photographers to connect, learn, and share their work. This can improve employability and be beneficial in the workplace, as businesses use social media to sell products and increase brand awareness. If you have many friends on social networks, they can become potential customers for your products. Matthews agrees that teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit in their future careers. He highlights that collaboration, a key feature of many sites, is an essential 21st-century skill and important for being employable in the digital age."
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long road trip through nine western US states and a Canadian province might not be the first thing that comes to mind. However, my parents had a different idea for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan what many teenagers would consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" my parents kept saying before the trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There's probably a reason for that!""

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough room left for us, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" Leaving our spacious home for more ""cozy"" accommodations over the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under some of the darkest, star-filled skies in the country, but only after nearly being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way!

The next day, we were up at dawn and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains, and the days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what was to come later in our journey. As we climbed to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dodging construction traffic became routine. We laughed as we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument.

We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common, and our own close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its creaky floors and no internet or cell phone service, couldn't dampen our spirits. In exchange, I got to see the most amazing views I've ever seen.

After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic foreign land to find something remarkable. It was bittersweet to be home again, but at least I hadn't fought with my brother during our hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos of our crazy journey to look through and remember. For me, the most memorable parts were the unplanned and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost, a sixteen-year-old, was moving to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was splitting up for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, was joining him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and living under the care of the college Head. She was happy to have the best room at the college, complete with a kitchen, study area, and free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still be keeping an eye on Amy.

Rose was going to her grandmother's house. She only had vague holiday memories of Daisy and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not thrilled, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was excited to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn't fully understand why her parents had issues with Daisy, but there had been a disagreement in the past, leading to holidays spent elsewhere. Rose's last goodbye to Daisy was when she was ten, but her memories were happy.

Dahlia mentioned that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and good at bringing people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon. This made Rose smile. Daisy was not a typical frail grandmother; she seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England. Before moving, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was mature and knew about healthy living. She wanted independence, like playing loud music, inviting friends over, or going out without always asking for permission. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and she didn't want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood.

Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen phone with a video camera for emergencies. Rose was thrilled. They agreed it was about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be overbearing. If either went too far, they would talk about it. Rose was never a wild child, and her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this was the last time, as she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new chapter in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book was a big achievement because it seemed challenging, and she wasn't aware of what other teenagers were doing, like participating in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to give it a try. The novel she started then is now about to be published. She recently told her former teacher, who was surprised, as the teacher had expected Charlotte to write a book at 30 or 40. Charlotte couldn't understand why she should wait to pursue something she might be good at.

On a winter afternoon at her publisher's office, I was surprised to see a teenager, even though I knew I was interviewing a 15-year-old about her book. The book is impressive: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing, except the heroine's age, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support, but she doesn't. Charlotte is independent, spirited, intelligent, and steady, which keeps her from being overconfident.

Charlotte recognizes the limits of her youth. When asked about the complex moral issues in her book, she says she wanted to ask big questions, not answer them. She laughs, saying she doesn't have many life lessons to share. She doesn't think her age limits her understanding of the world, but she doesn't consider herself particularly wise either. She was interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in fiction aimed at them. She believes there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager unaware of the world, and the socially awkward teenager. She found these stereotypes frustrating. She wonders why there aren't more stories about teenagers who are fine as they are. She feels that some writers unintentionally suggest teenagers can't know themselves because they lack experience, which can undermine their confidence.

Charlotte has always enjoyed reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. Their books explore deep psychological and life themes, which made her question if she needed to do the same to write a good book. However, she appreciates a book called ""How Not to Write a Novel,"" which advises that if readers can predict the story, the suspense is lost.

Some might think Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get published. Her father's connection in publishing did get her book read initially. She acknowledges her luck, as getting a first novel read is difficult, regardless of the author's age. Charlotte concludes that every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, success depends on talent, so she doesn't take her success for granted."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show he knew what he was doing, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump, hit the ramp fast, and flew into the air with his arms flailing. Even we could tell something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle stuff. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how, and I feared being laughed at by the skateboarders with their baggy trousers and special language. Then my parents decided on a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students would leap, try new tricks, and land in foam pits – not a realistic introduction to the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan assured us. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again. Land in the zone, and you keep moving forward, minimizing impact. Land on the flat, and you stop suddenly, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain and race towards the jump. My legs would almost go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came down onto the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing was addictive. Some drills copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body is doing as you spin in space. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I was only aware of the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last. On the final run of the day, I kept my speed as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed in the zone. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and your nails dig into the harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There's a pause, then a sharp drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You grit your teeth as you speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you let out a scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park.

It's interesting that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are such a big industry. To create the excitement and escape that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's actually a big challenge. Designers must find the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe, and they need to add new features to keep people coming back.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the tracks made by specialist manufacturers.

I spoke to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it's about quickly switching between different forces so people feel thrilled but safe. It's a fine line between excitement and discomfort.

To create an amazing ride, teams must build a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or the most twists. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that being a thrill-seeker helps designers understand what passengers want and test rides before they open to the public.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add a layer of excitement, like painting an old rollercoaster, but the physical ride experience will remain the main attraction for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating pieces for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances occasionally. I'm curious why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. She explains, ""Dancing again reminds me of what it's like to be in the studio, taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it's like to rehearse all day."" As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching and working with young students. ""New dancers are often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want success but don't fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This incomplete understanding makes them open to even harsh criticism. They might challenge me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her work. ""There might be music I'm not fond of, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don't respond well to a certain composer's music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can't just choose a new piece. Ideally, I'd like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces, which would help lift the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I'm always working on big productions where the musical score is already set by the composer and can't be changed.""

Miranda doesn't like to stick to one institution. ""I think it's important to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I need to adapt my work each time I go somewhere new, rather than doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.""

We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ""There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,"" says Miranda. ""This one tries to show viewers what life inside a dance company is really like. There was a scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I recognized that. She knows she's not getting it right but can't make her body do what's needed. It's painful to watch but not staged for the cameras. The public underestimates the work and dedication involved in ballet.""

I'm curious about what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ""It's when everything the company has invested in – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – all come together. Perfection might be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I've been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props is distracting. That's disappointing.""

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ""People want to label you, and I don't understand that. There's also a trend to develop expertise in a narrow area. I don't follow that, though I might one day be happy to be known for one thing. For now, I want to broaden my horizons."""
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on television. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there's so much to experience outside? That conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of an old sofa, which became the main feature of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to secure myself. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even spending one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to continue. I've been on many walking trips in recent years, but this was completely different. It was the longest distance I've ever walked, and it was on main roads, so I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I got used to telling people, ""No, I'm not doing it for charity, and I'm not training for a marathon."" When someone at work asks about my weekend, I'd rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was thrilled. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good fit for me. At the Greek port, the man seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although he still seemed puzzled, he let me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before the trip, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group—not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was thrilled when I finally did it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and enjoyment of completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant isn't easy, but it's a rewarding job. Since I started, I've traveled all over, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have plenty of time off, and life is never dull, which is perfect for someone young like me. As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, so I often flew alone. Feeling lonely, I would ask flight attendants if I could help serve meals, and some let me. This memory stayed with me when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new path. At the interview, there were many young people, and lots of them were accepted. They were often well-qualified, like me, and were changing careers. I prepared for the interview by talking about my strengths and past work experience, not just my love for travel, which everyone else would say. I got the job! I recommend this work to anyone because there are many benefits, but free flights aren't the main one. Airline staff work very hard, and there's a saying: ""no-one's finished till everyone's finished."" It's like a big family; even if we don't see each other often, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to bring work home. If I do encounter difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won't see them again."
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love watching the children achieve things they never thought possible. Most of them already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is usually new for them. Some children feel very nervous at first, but with some encouragement, they all try it and eventually reach the top. This accomplishment makes them feel fantastic. 

At the start of the week, some children feel homesick. Surprisingly, it's not the youngest ones who miss home the most, but rather the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't allow them to use their mobile phones all the time. Initially, we tell them they can call home after lunch. If they ask again after dinner, we suggest it's too late and they should call the next day. Most children adjust within a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they thank us for the great time they've had.

It's not just the children who feel lonely; sometimes parents call frequently to check on their child, which isn't really necessary. Often, the child is busy playing games or doing activities, so we ask the parents to call back later. We also notice a certain type of child who arrives in expensive new clothes. These children often resist when we ask them to change into more suitable attire, but they soon understand why it's necessary."
120,"""Rock the Planet"" is a musical show where the actors also need to be excellent musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the 'Best Musical' award four times. However, using an all-British cast was challenging because the UK has stricter rules on how many shows young actors can perform each week compared to the USA. This meant they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have already won their first 'Best Musical' award. The London theatre is larger than the one in the USA, but it has been full every night, with audiences eager to hear the songs that became famous in America.

I spoke with Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ""It's amazing that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar."" He explained how busy the young actors are, with regular school lessons at the theatre. ""The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends,"" he said. His classmates came to see the show because the theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. ""They loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it's expensive for them,"" Jamie added.

When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found an extra one and invited me to join him and the other young actors. We played a song called ""Days,"" which I didn't know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was proud when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie's talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was relieved the director wasn't there to hear my mistakes!

Although the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together because they were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year and is definitely worth seeing."
