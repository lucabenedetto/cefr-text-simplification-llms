1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This made people realize that sharing everything online might not always be good. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with the world, which can be exciting. We share our secrets, photos, and stories online. But sometimes, we find out too late that it can be risky and confusing.

This might sound sad, but don't worry. There is a way to understand this future, thanks to some early internet users. In the early days of the web, these people explored the internet and faced many challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with fame before social media existed. These early users, known as bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. We can learn from their stories.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at Cern, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall shared everything, and nothing was off-limits. His work was very open, but it was also artistic.

One day, visitors to Hall’s site found it replaced with a video called Dark Night. He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem of sharing too much online remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you more, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn’t say in person. But the internet is not a place where we can say anything without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and pretending otherwise can lead to big mistakes.

Armstrong’s story ended well. She was upset and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that just because we can say anything online, it doesn’t mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists were worried about the film and called it things like ""atrocious"" and ""very dangerous."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.

At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film talked about how new discoveries show that the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being affected by thoughts. A Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of water molecules could change just by the thoughts of people around them. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people found this evidence convincing, but many scientists did not. They wanted more proof that this effect was real, not just pretty pictures.

The film's claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force expanding the universe. This idea is supported by years of research. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Other discoveries are also amazing. Neuroscientists found that our brain's perception of events is delayed by about half a second. Anthropologists think they know where modern humans came from and why they spread across the world. Some theorists believe there are links between life on Earth and the universe's design.

Science is not finished. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty show that we can't understand everything completely. Some physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people think the universe is best described with one word: incredible."
3,"Writing novels and short stories is different for me. Writing novels is hard, like planting a forest, while writing short stories is fun, like planting a garden. Both are important and make a complete picture that I love. Trees in the forest give shade, and the garden has flowers that attract bees and butterflies. Since I started writing, I switch between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I write short stories, and after short stories, I go back to novels. I never mix the two because they use different parts of my brain. 

I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. It was hard at first, but I enjoyed it and felt my writing world grow. Readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is nice because they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to make a short story good, though I might revise it many times. Writing a novel takes a year or two and is a big commitment. Short stories are a nice change for me.

Short stories can come from small ideas, like a word or an image. It’s like jazz, where the story leads me. If a story doesn’t work, it’s okay. Not every story is a masterpiece, even for great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. I learn from my mistakes and use that in my next story. Writing short stories helps me when I write novels. They are like experiments for me. Without them, writing novels would be harder. My short stories are like soft shadows or footprints I leave behind. I remember each one and how I felt when I wrote it. They are like signs to my heart, and I’m happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also brought dangers. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it doesn't always succeed. It influences poets, politicians, and thinkers. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, and its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes think science is more or less important than it really is, and they often ignore its mistakes.

Science is full of conflicts. Old ideas are often changed or replaced by new ones. Like in music, new ideas in science are sometimes laughed at but later become accepted. Scientists can be jealous and angry, and the history of science is full of struggles. This book talks about scientific ideas that changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on these ideas, not on practical things like non-stick frying pans. We will admire the beauty of these ideas but also question them, knowing that human understanding has limits.

Science is always changing. Scientists often prove each other wrong. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. In the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics showed that our observations can affect the universe, and we don't fully understand our basic concepts. Some people think this shows science can't explain everything, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps moving forward.

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Some people now say we are close to a complete theory of everything. Maybe. Science is not just a hobby. In the last two centuries, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance. We need to watch science carefully. Everyone should understand scientific advances because they affect our world and future generations. Science is now part of how we plan our future, and these decisions are important for budgets, health, and life on Earth."
5,"Since around 2015, big publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped growing or even went down. This made people question if ebooks have a strong future in the publishing world. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, as his company lost faith in traditional books. Even though digital and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea keeps our imagination active and sparks debates. Why do we think of ebooks and print books as being in a fight, even when evidence shows they can coexist? This question is not just about ebooks; it shows how we feel both excited and scared about new technology and change.

In my research, I found that whenever a new technology comes out, people often think it will replace the old one. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear. But radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars or at work. The idea of books disappearing is not new either. In 1894, people thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has happened many times. Movies, radio, television, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some people thought losing books would harm culture, while others believed ebooks would bring great benefits.

The idea of books disappearing often comes up during times of technological change. This story shows our mixed feelings about new technology. We form emotional connections with things like books, TVs, and computers because they are important in our lives. Studies show we even name our cars or get mad at our laptops when they don't work. So, when new technology like e-readers appears, it changes our relationship with things we are used to. As technology changes, we miss what we used to have, which is why industries for old products and technologies exist. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. When movies added sound in the 1920s, people felt nostalgic for silent films. The same happened with the change from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers made people appreciate the feel and smell of old books again.

This should comfort those worried about print books disappearing. But the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a popular story about the power of technology and our dislike of change. We use familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the death of the book reflects our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our familiar world and ourselves."
6,"For almost every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I wrote about how some of the greatest minds in the past 400 years found time each day to do their best work. I looked at how they organized their schedules to be creative and productive. By writing about the simple details of their daily lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I wanted to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to show that they were like us, with habits and routines. 

The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the circumstances of creative work, not the work itself. It’s about how things are made, not what they mean. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever said you can’t even type a business letter without showing something of your inner self. My book looks at questions I struggle with: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to focus completely on a project or to work on it a little each day? When there isn’t enough time for everything, do you have to give things up, or can you learn to do more in less time?

I don’t have all the answers, but I’ve tried to show how different successful people have faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas come from small daily actions and how working habits affect the work itself. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary, but it can also be a way to use limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine helps focus your mental energy and keeps you from being controlled by your moods. The psychologist William James thought you should put part of your life on autopilot. By forming good habits, he said, we can focus on more interesting things. Ironically, James himself was a procrastinator and couldn’t stick to a schedule.

This book started from my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was at work trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a morning person, good at focusing early in the day but not after lunch. To feel better, I started looking online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought someone should collect them. So, I started the Daily Routines blog that afternoon, and now, this book. The blog was simple; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine profiles, and newspaper obituaries. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the short and varied voices that made the blog popular. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t be possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, decided they couldn't go on a holiday to Spain because of high interest rates. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach, and this sparked his interest in becoming a palaeontologist. 

As he studied at university, Howard realized he was interested in the very early history of life, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He liked studying ancient, delicate creatures found in rocks. When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job. He knew he was talented, but getting a job in science can be difficult.

Howard applied for a job at Tavistock College in London. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't attend because of an accident. The replacement professor didn't like the absent professor and made sure Howard got the job instead. Howard was surprised but happy to get the job, even after he learned why he was chosen. 

Howard enjoyed his work, which was organized and planned, unlike the unpredictable events in life. One day, his briefcase with important lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Annoyed, he went back to the college and postponed his lecture. While having coffee with a colleague and a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, he learned about a new collection of fossils that needed study. This opportunity became his biggest challenge and secured his future. 

Because of the theft, Howard changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a trip to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding the money to visit the museum in Nairobi. 

*An ammonite is a type of fossil from an extinct group of marine mollusk animals."
8,"Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University who studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. He is interested in making unusual foods, like ice cream made from bee larvae, more acceptable to people. Spence's research, called ""gastro physics,"" looks at how different things affect our eating experience, such as who we eat with, how food is presented, and even the sounds we hear while eating.

Spence has written a book called ""The Perfect Meal"" with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, which shares interesting facts about eating. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most, and we eat more when dining with others.

His lab at Oxford is simple and not high-tech, which allows him to work creatively with chefs who can't afford their own research. Much of his work is funded by big food companies. These companies are interested in reducing salt and sugar in their products without customers noticing, as it helps keep their customers healthy.

Spence has also worked with famous chef Heston Blumenthal to create dishes that combine food and sound, like the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish. His research shows that music can change how we taste food, with high-pitched music making food taste sweeter and low-pitched sounds making it taste bitter.

Spence's work is being used by the food industry in many ways. For example, an airline plans to match music with the food served to passengers. At home, Spence experiments with different sensory experiences during dinner parties, like using colored lights and sound to see how they affect taste. For Spence, both his home and his lab are places to explore how we experience food."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We get a lot of information, some true and some not, and we have to decide what is important. We also do more things ourselves now. For example, we book our own flights and find things in shops without help. We try to manage our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and TV shows, often using our smartphones to help. But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks, which is not efficient. This can make us stressed and confused. Multitasking can also make us want more distractions. Our brain likes new things, so it is easily distracted. Just having the chance to multitask can make us perform worse. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while having an unread email can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This is worse than being tired. Russ Poldrack, a scientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV, the information goes to a part of the brain for skills, not facts. Without TV, it goes to a part where it is better organized. Multitasking also involves making decisions, which is hard for our brains. Even small decisions can use a lot of brain power, leading to bad decisions later. Many people, including business leaders and scientists, say email is a big problem. It is not the email itself, but the large amount of communication. One scientist's son said his dad's job is answering emails, which is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and finish other tasks."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not important. Scientists only looked at animal behaviors and their results. They did not think animals had feelings or morals. But now, this is changing. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals might have emotions. This change has led to books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". These books have started a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? 

In one experiment, cows had to open a gate to get food. Cows that opened the gate themselves were happier than those that needed help. If cows like solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? Some people, like Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, think we should stop eating meat. He believes this is a big change in ethics, like when slavery ended. Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. 

These views may never agree because the main issue is philosophical. It is hard to define consciousness, so can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an experiment with starlings, a type of bird. At Newcastle University, starlings were put in two groups. One group had nice cages, and the other had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box. Later, when only bad worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages ate them. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt pessimistic. Balcombe, who supports animal rights, believes our view on animals will change, like our view on racism. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger. If he were alone in this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning wrote a textbook on animal behavior. He says opinions on animal thinking have changed over time. It is a difficult topic, and people have strong opinions."
11,"Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that people often think arguments help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve problems and make it harder to think deeply. West mentions that we are surrounded by a lot of poor but attractive ideas and opinions, which can confuse our thinking. More information does not always mean better knowledge or decisions. 

Reading books has decreased, and some experts, like Patricia Greenfield, believe that focusing more on visual media, like TV and video games, might reduce critical thinking. She says that reading helps imagination and thinking in ways that visual media do not. However, visual media can improve some types of information processing. Most visual media do not give time for thinking or imagination, which might lead to people not using their full potential.

The way society views technology affects how we think about critical thinking. Video games are a good example. Some people think they are bad for kids, but James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says they can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills. They allow players to explore ideas in a virtual world similar to the real one. As reading and math scores go down, it is important to understand how technology affects our thinking."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but left because he didn't like it. His first book talks about the benefits of working with your hands. His latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. Crawford noticed that these ads make it hard for us to focus on what we want to think about. We often don't realize how much they affect us. This makes it difficult to think or remember past conversations. To avoid being interrupted, people stop talking to strangers. Crawford says we often see the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can control our desires. Many people are worried about this. For example, some office workers complain about emails but still check them in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone on a table can distract us. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford believes technology makes it easy for us to focus on ourselves. This affects our self-control and social life. We prefer texting to talking because it's easier. By only interacting with screens, we might lose important social skills. Crawford gives an example from his gym. Before, there was one music player for everyone, which sometimes caused disagreements. Now, people use earbuds and listen to their own music, making the gym less social. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public. Second, we should do activities that require skill, like cooking or playing sports, to connect with the real world. These activities help us focus better and make us less distracted by technology."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. For most people, it's easy to answer. But for me, as a philosopher, it's a bit harder. Saying you are a philosopher can sound a bit arrogant. People might think you claim to know some special truth. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why do people think this way about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who think deeply and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle said that a life of thinking is the best life. Not many modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just following what everyone else does is not satisfying. We can think about our lives and make our own choices. But you don't need to read a lot of philosophy books to do this. It just means looking closely at our daily lives to see if they are really important. You don't have to be a wise person living away from society. In fact, thinking about life should be practical and shared with others. This is part of a good life. Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become very separate from everyday life. This is partly because of how universities work. Philosophers often write in expensive and hard-to-read journals. So, they don't get to share their ideas with many people. For most people, philosophy seems far from real life. If philosophers used to fight this idea, many don't anymore. Universities have created a place where philosophers are isolated, and they have supported this. Some areas of philosophy are now very technical and hard to understand, even for other philosophers. Philosophy has, in some cases, moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about judging human actions. But I feel this title doesn't fully explain my work. Ethics is often seen as rules and laws. This is a new idea in philosophy. Ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at whether certain social practices are fair. Ethicists today decide if something is ‘ethical’ or okay. These are important questions, and I think about them a lot. But philosophy is more than this. A discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is wrong (it is) and then look at how we think about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps us look closely at our actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find out things we already know; other times, we see our beliefs are hard to defend. By thinking about these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,"Text: People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. In the past, philosophers talked about food mainly to discuss other ideas. When they mentioned eating, it was often a metaphor for learning or understanding something else. Sometimes, it seemed like they were talking about food, but they were actually discussing deeper topics. 

An interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many parts of life. However, his name is now often linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites. These businesses likely hope that using his name will make their products more appealing.

Food is a social and cultural thing. It comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities give us people to eat with and help grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more important ways than with any other product, making it a good topic for philosophical discussion.

Once food is made, critics talk and write about it. But why do they have such an important role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill. Instead, food critics are just better at describing tastes. Philosophers have not paid much attention to how we taste, focusing more on vision. This should change.

Another part of food is aesthetics, or beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers think that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. But food is eaten and disappears, unlike art or music, which lasts over time. So, some think food cannot be considered a true object of beauty.

There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often show our ethical beliefs. Philosophers ask why we make these choices, and discussing this is important.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of love and friendship. At home, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food. Their kitchens are for qualified people, and their relationships are professional.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways. First, we can appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food. Second, we build personal connections with people from other cultures by eating together, a practice with a long history in diplomacy. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy exciting for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He thought the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. So, he started thinking about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect the next one? He changed a classic board game called Risk to make a new version: Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made during play have a lasting effect. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules. The game is played over several sessions, and players remember past actions. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau was then asked to help make a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to stop diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very popular, SeaFall was a big test for the legacy format because it was not based on an earlier game. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players explore and conquer new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said: ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to have problems, and you have to fix everything.’

Legacy board games were not expected to become very popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a small interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is different and good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks many rules. I thought only a few people would like it.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it is a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and you get that with legacy games.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, liked the adventure of legacy games more than worrying about the game lasting. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and ruining the board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It’s like the stories in video games.’ The legacy format is similar to video games and popular TV series. Daviau wanted to be a TV writer in college but moved to advertising and then game design. He still liked telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares making a legacy game to writing a book. ‘You need to know how it starts and ends,’ he said. ‘But you also need more than just an outline.’

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he wants to see what others do with the idea. But he also thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, thinks the legacy format is a big change. ‘It changes how you think about what a board game can be,’ he said."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online and seemed like something from a children's movie. People enjoy stories like this because they like to imagine animals acting like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very smart even though they look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

Some people think that giving animals human-like traits is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes that ignoring the human-like traits of animals is the real problem. He calls this ""anthropodenial."" He says that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.

In the past, people believed animals were smart. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, scientists like Charles Darwin thought that the difference between humans and animals was not very big. But in the 20th century, people started to see animals as simple creatures that only responded to rewards and punishments. This view changed how people treated animals and their habitats.

Dr. de Waal believes we are now starting to understand animal intelligence better. He says that the best tests for animal intelligence consider the unique skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid their nuts. In her book, ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we are not very smart because we can't change the color of our skin.

Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean, but he knows that stories like Inky's help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they could feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got upset. A video of this experiment convinced many people of the findings. This shows how powerful stories and videos can be in changing our views on animal intelligence."
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to the industrial revolution. Robots have been used in car and factory work for many years, but experts say robots will soon be used in many more areas. However, many countries are not ready for this big change. Most people think robots will do most jobs in the next 50 years, but they also believe their own jobs will still exist. This is not true: all job areas will be affected by robots soon. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that takes two people almost a day. In San Francisco, a company called Simbe Robotics created Tally, a robot that moves around supermarkets to check if products are stocked and priced correctly. People who support robots say they will create new jobs for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. But critics say we should not forget the importance of human skills at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing jobs. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will make new laws about robots. In five years, salaries in robotics will go up by 60%, but many jobs will still be empty because there are not enough skilled workers. Zhang says that people with lower skills will be affected by robots, and they should learn new skills instead of hoping the government will protect their jobs. New technologies will also create new types of robots for homes and personal use, like robots that can walk and interact with us. This is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future. Countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it's there."" The reporter's question showed that many people want to understand why someone would do something so dangerous. Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams and face the unknown. The real reason for climbing might just be adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He said that the way you climb, like using more or less equipment, depends on the rules of the game you are playing. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in the climbing world, influencing everything from magazines to discussions around campfires.

Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. However, climbing can also be limiting, like when you are stuck in a tent during a storm. This shows a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. But some say that having fewer choices makes life simpler, which is a kind of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He thinks climbing is in our genes and that we naturally want to take on challenges, even if they are risky. This means the joy of climbing is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor wrote that climbing helps develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He believes these virtues are important in today's world, which often avoids risks. Climbing can help people develop traits that are useful in everyday life.

Some climbers believe that those who climb without help from others or technology must be very committed to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson argued that climbing is more impressive when done independently, without things like bottled oxygen. This idea caused some controversy because it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Climbing can also be understood by looking beyond Western ideas. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone"" while climbing. The physical effort, meditation, and problem-solving involved in climbing are similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became very important in classical music. He was a serious and smart person who played and recorded many famous European piano pieces. He wrote and played a lot but did not teach much. People who knew him well saw he could be fun, but he was usually serious in his concerts. His life was full of study, travel, and performances. 

Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not think it was a good idea. He had not taught many students and did not plan to start. He said, ‘You don’t need a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something special about Kit, who was about 14 years old then. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played very well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital he had done. Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit’s performance was very special, and it is rare to find a musician with such skill.

As Brendel is retiring, Kit is starting his career, but Brendel is careful to make sure Kit does not work too hard too soon. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new things like languages, math, computer coding, and playing tennis, with his mother always watching over him. He also writes music. Brendel says this is important because writing music helps you understand it better. Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. He listens carefully to his own playing and to Brendel’s advice. When Brendel explains something, Kit understands and can do it.

Brendel is careful not to raise too many expectations. He does not like it when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century because it can be harmful. Kit can play some things very well, but he still needs time and experience for others. Critics should not expect him to be perfect.

Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I reached 50, I had done most of those things, but I continued to do more. Even though I don’t have the physical strength now, I still think about many pieces I’ve never played. I don’t play now, but it’s a nice new part of my life.’"
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were always beautiful places. My Grandad's garden was not in a dirty city. It was next to a river and went down gently to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places to escape, find peace, and be alone. Grandad's garden was simple. He didn't have a fancy greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic covering broken glass.

At home, my father was often quiet. He wasn't without humor, though. He liked to say things like, ""It's immaterial to me,"" instead of just saying, ""I don't mind."" He probably wished he had done more with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, but he didn't love it. He wasn't very ambitious, though he and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn't happen. He was good at fixing things around the house, like making bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mom liked to change the furniture often. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when we got a piano. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mom thought they were too fancy and took them away. I never got to play the piano; my sister had lessons instead. When I asked my mom later why I didn't get lessons, she said, ""You'd never have practiced.""

I liked going to the river more than the moors or woods. I would go there with a fishing net and old sandals. I would find a spot to take off my sandals and look for fish to catch with my net. After trying to keep them alive at home, I would put them back in the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as I could, but it seemed unlikely until my father said, ""There's a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested."" My dad usually didn't like gardening, but he saw how much I loved it. I like to think he hoped it would be a good choice for me."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I am with him. The strong wind from the Atlantic feels like it could blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen's sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and MacEwen gently pets him. Even with the wind, MacEwen looks comfortable on his island. He points to the north and shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see rain falling on Rum's big mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ When rain starts coming our way, MacEwen says, ‘I have sheep to move.’ We walk down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Muck is three km long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. We stop talking to herd the sheep. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to gather the sheep but is not doing well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen says, meaning the dog should go to the right. But Tie goes straight into the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, sounding disappointed. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks sorry. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They go out and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available sometimes. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary preparing breakfast with a flashlight. I get used to it, along with no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck feels surprising. The boat today brings groceries and three musicians with instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their boots to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay from a newspaper ad without seeing it. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know how to run a farm? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it tastes amazing. Also amazing: my ferry ride the next morning to another island. In the last two months, many ferries were canceled because of high seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, with or without a phone, is what I secretly hoped for."
22,"The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people. But now, the video games industry is taken seriously. This doesn't surprise experts. Making video games is not easy. When a new movie comes out, video games based on it need many team members and months of hard work. Like many industries, it's hard to get into, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it’s hard to make progress in big companies or to influence big games. But the industry needs more game designers. Not just the directors who lead the whole game, but also the people who design parts of the game.

How can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim thinks differently. He says the only way is to make games. The tools are available. You need to create something to get a job. Game design is more than a job; it’s a way of life. Like any creative work, you have to do it to make it real.

Another expert, John Field, says there are other ways. He agrees with ""just doing it,"" but says it’s more complicated. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs. Even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and business ability to really help the industry grow. Can you do it alone? John says it’s tricky, but a good postgraduate course in games can help. It can give you support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all kinds of entertainment and arts. They might have worked for a few years after graduation and then decided that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and know about the growing variety of games. Connections can also help. Networking is important to get ahead in games, just like in many other fields.

The old idea of a teenage boy playing video games all day is outdated. Now, games are seen as a serious medium. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. Games are popular with large audiences and are a great way to learn. He sees many possibilities and opportunities in this already big area."
23,"Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy. He always told him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and never played football again. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score a great goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but it's not. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. You can only score amazing goals by practicing a lot. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned technique. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that education is important, but back then, I only thought about football. The teachers were good, but I didn't notice it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope he doesn't just want to kick them around like I did. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so young players like me could play for the first team. He didn't make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely on my close friends and family a lot. Having a lot of money can cause problems. People sometimes say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would be upset if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I like using my money to help people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think, and it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I want to take a year off or maybe longer to do things I couldn't do before. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke my leg skiing and couldn't play football, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my dad's agent in Los Angeles. My dad couldn't write anything good while we lived in Los Angeles, so Sam offered to find us a cheap place to live. He was worried about losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point wasn't popular with day-trippers. The road was not nice, and the nearby resort, La Carmella, was more attractive. People only came to Reef Point if they had no money or loved surfing. But when the weather got hot, many people came, and the place was busy. My dad was trying hard to write a script on time and was in a bad mood. I spent most days on the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We didn't have a dog when we moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One day, I gave him water, and my dad half-heartedly tried to scare him off. I asked my dad who Rusty belonged to, and he said, ""He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved swimming and always came with me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my dad went to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. One surfer stood out to me. She was very skilled. She finished surfing and came over to talk. She asked why I didn't join them, and I said I didn't have a surfboard or money. She noticed I was British and asked if I was visiting. I told her I lived there and that my dad was writing a film script. She asked if she knew him, and I said his name was Rufus Marsh. She recognized his book, ""Tall as the Morning,"" and looked at me with new interest. I realized people were friendly but only really interested when I mentioned my dad's book."
25,"Violet Hetherington was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline ship. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this advice turned out to be wrong. An announcement said there was a problem with the computer system, making the passengers frustrated. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service.

Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left it there because all her contacts were saved on the phone. Her son Harry always warned her about this. She asked a friendly couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to look for her phone at home. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble finding important numbers in New York.

Finally, the line started moving, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. She was disappointed by the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were fake walnut panels, shiny chandeliers, and airport-style carpets. She took the elevator, crowded with tired passengers, to the twelfth floor where her room was. Thankfully, it had the balcony she wanted. She had paid extra to make sure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he didn't know he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for taking interesting photos. Since then, Maloof has collected many of Maier’s belongings, including her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, as well as 8mm movies and audiotapes. Maloof feels lucky to have found this collection. He said, ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was. I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’

Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be private and always had a camera with her. She wore large coats, big hats, and strong shoes. Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter, said, ‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night.’ Maier had strong opinions about movies and politics and knew a lot about theatre and movies. She was not very social but was not afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, sometimes recording them on audiotape. She was very dedicated to her photography, which was like her ‘second job’. Rydzon said, ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life. She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’

Maier’s work is pure art; she didn’t do it for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. Photography expert Larry Silverman finds her pictures very interesting and wonders if she developed her style on her own or was influenced by other photographers. Maloof often thinks about whether he will ever finish looking through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. Before discovering Maier’s work, Maloof wasn’t very interested in photography. But her photos inspired him to start taking his own pictures. He said, ‘As I progressed as a photographer and went back and visited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition.’ Maloof now wants to make sure people know about Vivian Maier and her work. He hopes to get her name into the history books."
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But that's not true for Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular, but she was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who asked, ""What's it about?"" This is a hard question for an author. The Luminaries takes place in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are a series of crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past gave more chances for her characters to face problems. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it's nice coming from a small country because everyone feels part of the success. She added that it bothers her when people think her book isn't a serious work. She had an idea to write the book like a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. It gets faster as it goes. I asked if it matters if readers notice this. She said she wanted to create a book with patterns that didn't matter, but if readers cared, they could find them. Even with its unusual structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery with a gripping story. Surprisingly, she didn't plan the story in advance. She would write herself into a difficult situation and then find a creative way out. She also wanted the book to be fun for readers. We talked about her love for TV drama series. I asked if she might want to write for TV. She said, ""That could be pretty cool,"" with excitement. She loves talking about her work and New Zealand. She notices how her imagination changes when she visits Britain. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busy places to be around more people. But for now, New Zealand will stay her home. Many hope it inspires her to write more novels."
28,"When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he loved making things in his dad’s garage and playing the guitar. These two hobbies became his job for the last forty years: he builds steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny says, ‘I’m still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? And using different types of wood makes different sounds. It still surprises me.’

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to play the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you want something, you make it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and woods change the sound and how to build them.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny made from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ‘We drew and built model boats and planes, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use tools. I also fixed and customized instruments for my friends.’

Jonny’s bass guitar was good, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a job. ‘I also liked painting and sculpture,’ he says. After school, he decided to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture is about design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he remembers. But he left the course halfway through. ‘I was too independent for it,’ he says. ‘But I realized I wanted to build guitars. It’s like sculpture because you shape sound. And it seemed more practical than pure art because you make things people use.’

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of the materials, but as he became known as a great guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just getting by.’ He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to become known. He went to music festivals on weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his guitars, which was hard for him.

Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the best acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as good, even though we have always had good courses and skills here. But now, our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says you can learn important skills in classes, and new instrument-makers should take courses. But he also believes in learning by trying things out. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If someone else teaches you, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’"
29,"When English people start a conversation, they often talk about the weather. This is a tradition, and it was noted by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century writer, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they are very interested in it. However, this is not the case. 

The American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not exciting because it doesn't have extreme events like tornadoes or blizzards. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman believes the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you never know what weather you will get.

My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the main point. English people talk about the weather not because they care about it, but because it helps them start conversations. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Isn’t it cold?"" are not really about the weather. They are ways to greet people or fill in gaps in conversation. This is similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially.

There are specific times when English people use weather talk. It can be a greeting, a way to start a conversation, or a topic to fill awkward silences. This happens often, so people from other countries might think English people are obsessed with the weather. An English conversation might start with weather talk, use it to break the ice, and return to it if there is nothing else to say. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather a lot."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip over trips to Spain, Greece, or France. But they really wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. When she couldn't find a historical novel to help explain life at the Wall in Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. She felt it was a big change. ‘Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very tiring. Writing is exciting but not as exhausting. My old teaching friends are jealous because I still connect with children through my stories.’ Alice wants her books to fill a gap in children’s fiction. ‘Many books for teenagers today are about negative experiences. They are well written,’ she adds, ‘but they are often dark or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different.’ Alice always taught English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy, and she loves seeing children go from bored to interested. She sees writing as a way to keep teaching. She was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher also suggested she try a creative writing course. At first, Alice didn’t want to do it, but she had to send her best piece of fiction to join the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After sending it, she was accepted into the course. Other students liked her story and suggested she publish it. With only school report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and he helped her a lot. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we are rival authors, but we work well together. He helps improve my writing by changing sentences and suggesting new words. I like to add more scenes. That’s the difference between a writer and an editor.’"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. The race would be between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and it’s very cold now, so I’ll be warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. Unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, Alistair wore full winter cycling clothes. He was confident despite the cold. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’

The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 meters up. This was not a problem for the car, but Alistair had a tough start with a steep hill. After a quick handshake, they began. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss, while Jonny got in the car and drove on the road. They would see each other again at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s confidence was tested right away. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first problem: a giant tractor came onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he joked to the cameraman in his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!’ After the tractor moved, Jonny continued driving into the morning mist.

Alistair was having a hard time with the hill. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched him as he kept going with his bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side, the ground was open, and with the sun coming out, he could go faster. He put his head down, feet on the pedals, and picked up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The villages in this part of Yorkshire are very old, and the roads are not made for fast driving. Jonny had to drive slowly around a narrow corner and through a stream on the road. Once past the last village, he drove straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped to Fleet Moss, Alistair was crossing his last field and getting back on the road from the other side. He pedaled hard and then stopped quickly as he reached the line. 

Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, ‘Is he here?’ When they said no, he raised his arms in victory. Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said, feeling disappointed. ‘I’m gutted.’"
32,"Text: 'When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the first thing you notice is the silence. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it, hearing the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds make you feel like you are in a different world. The quiet helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to think only about the game and the point I’m playing. When a point is over, the silence breaks with applause and cheers. I hear them, but they feel far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching me closely or the millions watching on TV as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who is my coach, always told me it was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I would play there and win. Before 2008, I played and lost twice to Federer – in the finals the two years before. Losing in 2006 wasn’t too hard because I was just happy to be there at age twenty. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have done better, and it was my mind, not my skills, that let me down. I cried a lot after that loss. Losing is always painful, but it’s worse when you had a chance to win. My uncle Toni, who is a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me, even when I win. But after that loss, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I told him he didn’t understand, that it might have been my last chance. I know a professional athlete’s career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I missed a big one in 2007. But Toni was right. I got another chance in 2008, just one year later. I was sure I learned from my defeat the year before, and this time my mind was strong. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends. We didn’t talk about the match because I was already thinking about it in my mind. Until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone.'"
33,"In April 1957, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa. She wrote to her family saying, ""I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made her famous with articles and TV shows about her research on chimpanzees. Jane also wrote popular books, including the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century, possibly only second to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes hides her real achievements. Many stories about her life focus on her adventures and dreams but do not fully show what she has done. Jane Goodall should be seen as a leading scientist because of her research, her students who became important scientists, and the large amount of data she collected over 40 years.

Jane's main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We also did not know that they have emotions and social systems similar to humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her study in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements.

Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves because chimpanzees are our closest relatives. Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. When she was five, she disappeared one day, and her family and police searched for her. She was found with straw in her hair and explained that she had been hiding in a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity was an early sign of her future as a biologist."
34,"During our first conversation, which lasted an hour, Shirley Ford talks to me using different voices. She sounds like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to say many medical words.’ Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it. You have to make the script come alive for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get the parts because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a normal acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a big part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and many forms, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of a job that includes many things from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and happy. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; working with other actors makes a big difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that help voiceover artists make them.’ She says she got to where she is – near the top of her profession – through hard work as much as natural talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a love for human sound is important, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a certain kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because being a cartoonist is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people give up these dreams and choose more realistic jobs, like being a lawyer or working in a factory. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like the ones in school notebooks, seems silly. But some people do it. 

People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and showed my drawings to different companies after graduating. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to live on.

To be a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The job is tough, and you should only try it if you can't imagine doing anything else. It's easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don't say no to any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don't really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about everything.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs with newspapers and magazines, but those days are ending. Now, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than those who are very artistic but lack business sense.

I often meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they won't show their work to anyone! To protect your work, just draw a small 'c' for 'copyright,' put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and getting rid of things I didn't need. I decided to throw away an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to get rid of it? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, ""Are you really going to throw that away?"" I said yes, but I already felt a bit sad about it. He asked if he could have it, and I agreed. We went our separate ways. 

In the years after, I often felt sad about losing the guitar. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. The email was from a man named Keith Rushton, who restores guitars. He told me, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so happy I almost cried. Keith's price was fair, and I was grateful. 

My dad used to put name-and-address stickers on everything I owned, including the guitar. He would have laughed at this story! My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s because it was popular then. I loved the sound, but I didn't get very good at it. So, I switched to the electric guitar, which was easier to play. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn't have to be a great musician to be a rock star.

When I got my guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. The guitar felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I picked it up and felt like I needed to stand up to play it. My fingers remembered how to play the chords, even though I couldn't draw them. My fingertips hurt a bit from pressing the strings, but it felt good. The electric guitar is not really for playing alone, so maybe I need to start a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who can't sleep well, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is getting more attention now. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them. We often lose dreams when we wake up early. The last hour or two of sleep, which we often miss, is mostly REM sleep, where we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM sleep, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM sleep. When people are deprived of REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests that dreams are important. When researchers found REM sleep in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who thought that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. But later research did not fully support this idea. Now, dream studies focus more on the physical origins of dreams. Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He concluded that people who are interested in creativity use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Dreams, according to Stickgold, help us connect things in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new ideas. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create new combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ignore the obvious and connect things in unexpected ways. This is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come to me so quickly that I can barely type fast enough. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small town by the sea in south-west England. In her studio, you can see empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leader in the copyist art movement, which means she can paint copies of famous artworks. She can make a painting look like a 20th-century impressionist masterpiece or a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait. But she doesn't keep her own paintings because they sell quickly. Susie is very popular. In her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has copied works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts sometimes think they are the originals. While the real paintings are worth millions, Susie's copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how long she spends on them. Susie doesn't usually say who buys her paintings, but her clients include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors like to show off their 'Van Gogh' paintings, even though they are actually 'Susie Ray Van Goghs'. Some people use her copies to save on house insurance by keeping the original in a bank. Susie is honest about her work. She makes her copies look very real and signs her name on the back. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and Susie has never done that. She knows people who have, but they often get into trouble. Susie isn't rich and has had hard times, but her life is more stable now. She used to work as an illustrator for a botanical garden after her art degree, but it didn't pay well. It was good practice for her current work, and she learned to love plants. She advises young artists to learn to draw well and study a lot. Susie can draw anything from plants to 15th-century masterpieces, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie says it's not. The impressionists painted quickly but were also very careful, which is hard to do. Susie doesn't create her own original art because she enjoys making copies and earns a good living from it. She has tried her own art, like painting fishing nets, but they just looked like photos. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything else. She wanted to be the fastest person on the water. From a young age, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, normal life seemed unimportant. People always wanted to know about the race, and she quickly wanted to return to the ocean. She liked testing herself against nature, even in dangerous places.

After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and work space for 94 days. She talked about how carefully she planned everything, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. Preparation was very important to her. She proudly showed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical items. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and needing protection. Her view changed after a trip to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. There, she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. She saw many abandoned whaling stations and felt it was a warning. It seemed like people just took what they wanted and left. 

When I visited Ellen’s office, she explained why we must act now to save the planet. She said, ""No one is making coal, oil, or gas anymore. They are precious and limited. We need to find ways to not use them up."" At first, her message was to use less, but then she started talking about re-using things, like reusable carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our use of non-renewable resources. 

Ellen started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a sustainable future. She misses the adventure of being at sea, but she feels her new work is more important. She says, ""I may have been the fastest around the world, but this is the most important thing I’ve ever done."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he could become very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan wants to inspire them to go outside and try new things. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

Some experienced climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They believe a young climber might be strong enough physically, but they worry if a teenager is emotionally ready. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.'

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father loves adventure? Paul says, 'This is not about me becoming famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later, but we decided, why not now? We always check with him to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on reaching my goal.'

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record challenge. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This is a challenge for Jordan. People might say that focusing on records takes away the fun, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to share his story with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.'"
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I am studying music at university, but even my classmates don't know much about classical music. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't have their music. The numbers are not good for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and a typical classical album sells only about 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. Why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. Some teenagers do go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big fan of classical music. I like many styles, but I probably listen to classical music as little as that 3% figure suggests. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk, play, and think fast. Experts say we can't focus for more than about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more interesting to us than long classical pieces without words. Classical music is powerful but doesn't deal with issues that matter to teenagers. How we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people are going to classical concerts now, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why more people like classical concerts as they get older, but I know that if your parents love something, you might avoid it. Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play it in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They like classical music when they play it, but it's not their first choice when they relax. For that, it's always pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said quietly to the school. Her mother was getting out of the car too, but she didn’t hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t mind if her mother heard because she knew how Bonnie felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre. ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be thrown out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. Bonnie liked horses and treated them well. The horses were well cared for, she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition."" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,"" she thought. The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, which made Bonnie happy. She was so focused on putting a saddle on Maverick that she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed when she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The movement was exciting, and the breeze felt nice on her face. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by how confident he is. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia who has already made some very popular songs. But how did a relaxed surfer become a star with thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I started playing guitar when I was six and writing songs at seven. But I was also swimming and surfing every day. Those activities were more important to me back then. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online."" These videos changed everything for him. He started by posting a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans loved it and asked for more videos on social media. Cody, who had recorded more songs at home, was happy to share them. The response was amazing. Cody was also a very good swimmer. He trained with top coaches and focused on swimming. But then music companies noticed him, and he had to make a big decision: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a risk by signing a music deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine, at 12 or 13, trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked faces. ""I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family to the US, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him. Cody says it’s important to have good people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, everyone has days of doubt. ""Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old, and he’s traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about that sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they’re here to support me."" Success, in any career, comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to big opportunities, even when they’re a bit scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be visiting countries I never thought I’d see and playing in front of so many fans – it’s like a dream that many people have. But I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. There was a new crack in the ice shining in the morning sun. I looked up the river towards the sandbags that were there to stop the buildings from flooding when the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags. Last week, I worked with many people from the town for long hours to show I could do it. But my grandfather didn’t seem to notice. 

With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile of dark water made by the factory in Milltown. There was ice on both sides, and then solid ice downstream. As I changed out of my pyjamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. He was trying to walk on the ice near the warm water from the factory. I put on my kayaking jacket and checked the pocket for my lucky chain. It’s a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip, which I read before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen.

‘Morning, Rex,’ Mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ My wetsuit should have made that clear. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s getting harder. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom came over with a kind smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say he’s always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a kid, he was my hero. He showed me his photos in National Geographic. Those old photos are still on his wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now, and maybe one day, my own photo in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay close to him, even if he’s grumpy. 

Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back and peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my trip.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I hurried to the boathouse in the backyard."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was a painting without a frame. It was clearly Grandpa's work, but different from anything he had done before, and it wasn't finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on something."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in the scene, but it wasn't a river she knew. It might not even be a real river, just an imaginary one. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green, and the eye was drawn to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it seemed right that way. It felt like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, hiding her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? I mean, for him to be so specific. Maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not the artist's job to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" ""Someone who gives an artist ideas."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually, he said the muse wasn't helping him today, or he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on. He never suggested the muse was her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a person. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet by itself. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I will cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm unlucky that way.

I wasn't really thinking about cutting holes. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's small, white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it. I keep my shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her cabinet, so I was excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it needs to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But Angela is only fifteen, so I'll be in my small room for a while. I don't mind; I like my cosy room. The roof slopes down, and the window is at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to fit Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a bit too tall. If I could just cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom... Then I thought, if I can't cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased because he always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' view, not a human one, which made filming more difficult. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully strange. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act at all. One important thing for me was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off because she was sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t very accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists, but there are none. I wonder how long it will take before things get crazy. It always happens: fake smiles, people pretending to be friends, and asking for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. ""Everything’s going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the band is here for recording, we’re staying for good. I chose this school because I want to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so normal. 

I walk into the school’s main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the school secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. Not many people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it’s printing,"" she says. She hands me the schedule. English Literature is my first class. I like English, so that’s good. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t get lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already calling roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. Nobody will suspect anything now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them, she lets us socialize. All teachers should do this. ""So why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many choices. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else pick a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Everyone will find out eventually. But I can pretend to be normal for now. ""He’s an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way."" And she doesn’t seem to care. Perfect."
49,"The average American teenage girl today is expected to do many things. She should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what being a teenager in America is like now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and be average. Being average is not enough anymore. If you don't have big goals, people might think you are lazy. 

Teenagers have a lot of pressure. They have homework, tests, activities after school, jobs, chores at home, and they also try to have a social life. Kristen Loose, a teenager, says that even with all these pressures, people still think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, and only care about themselves. While some teenagers might be like this, it is not fair to say all teenagers are the same. 

Many people think teenagers spend all their time watching TV or on their phones. Kristen Loose says this is not true. She keeps her phone close, but not just for fun. It helps her stay connected and manage her life. Today, students need to be connected to the world all the time, which can look like they are addicted to their phones. With smartphones and tablets, students can do their homework anywhere. Schoolwork and activities now need attention all the time, not just at school.

Many teenagers start their day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the nine hours of sleep they need. A survey found that only 20% of American teenagers get enough sleep. Also, 28% of them fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are so tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she only has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. She doesn't waste this time on social media or TV. Instead, she likes to volunteer. Olsen says people think teenagers only care about themselves, but she enjoys helping others. Her favorite part of the week is when she volunteers. She wants to make a positive impact in her school and community.

In the future, the stereotype of teenagers might change, but they will still be proving it wrong and making the world better. There will be new students who will do amazing things even before they finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the past few years, this group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a science project that mixes astronomy with adventure, which attracts teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to launch a high-altitude balloon to try and record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside the box, there was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check temperature changes. Two GPS trackers were on the outside to help find the box later. A gas tank, given by someone from a nearby state, was used to fill the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy had driven seven hours to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it was time to launch. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they counted, and the balloon started to rise. Some of them ran and followed its path with strong flashlights until they couldn't see it anymore. There was a quiet and a shared feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky. It was hard to believe they were just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor crossed the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is not much inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who said they’ve only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. ‘It’s important to remember that these students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What seems wild and dangerous to some is just normal life to others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but it was also a chance to talk about atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. And it was another adventure story to share with others."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she wasn't interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. It happened by chance when she helped her younger brother with a science project about dinosaurs. She found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology, and it amazed her. She realized she wanted to learn more about it. 

Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous. She was nervous at first, worried he might think she was just a kid bothering him with questions. But he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

Chloe talks about how movies and TV shows often show palaeontologists in a misleading way. Films like Jurassic Park have made people interested in dinosaurs, but they don't always show what palaeontologists really do. Chloe explains that her job is varied. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs analyzing fossils, and writes for scientific publications. She also thinks it's important to explain science to the public, especially to young people, to help them understand more about the natural world.

Chloe worked on the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, where she helped make sure the dinosaurs were shown accurately. She says the dinosaurs in the show are very life-like and different from those in movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes dinosaurs fascinate us because they appeal to our sense of adventure and discovery. They remind us that there is still much to learn about the world, and Palaeontology is like a form of time travel."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you probably know you are not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" Once you arrive, it becomes ""here,"" not ""there."" So, if you think you might be ""there,"" you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" Parents probably want to be ""there"" more than kids do because they hear this question a lot during long car trips.

Think about it: as kids, we get to relax in the back seat. We can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the scenery passes by outside. In the front seat, mum or dad is like a helper, giving out juice boxes and cookies, changing the radio, and making sure everything is okay.

But sometimes, things go wrong. For example, my younger brother Tim might put his foot on my side of the seat. I don't like that, so I put my foot on his side. Then he might move more, and soon we are fighting. Mum or dad has to stop us and tell Tim to stay in his seat. This calms things down for a while.

Later, I might feel a breeze on my arm, even though the window is closed. It's Tim, blowing air on me from his seat. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is not doing anything wrong. This makes me angry, and Tim gets in trouble again. Then things calm down once more.

Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us. When we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he sometimes says, ""Yes, we are here. Get out of the car."" But we are still on the highway, so we know we are not there yet. This makes us quiet for a while.

You know you are finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids. So remember, if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and come back. Zuzi says they started this business because everyone is always on their phones and gadgets. They wanted to bring people together without screens. 

In their café, people play games called 'Eurogames'. These games have gentle themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources. Everyone stays involved, and no one feels left out. Later, 'co-operative' games were created, where players win or lose as a team, which makes people talk more. 

One popular Eurogame is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings. He wanted to create a game where everyone feels good, win or lose. As a child, Leacock loved games but often felt disappointed by them. With his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very successful, and its next version included more storytelling, like in video games.

The video game industry has helped board games become popular. Many people now play games on their phones, so more people are open to playing games. Video games and board games have learned from each other. Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many video games are played online, so people are looking for games to play with others in person. 

John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun. In our online world, games are a way to connect with others in real life, and this trend is growing."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many false beginnings. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him start playing the guitar. The only radio station he heard at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced him as he grew up. He says he was 12 before he heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. He says, ‘I was good at tennis, but it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was too much hard work.’ At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to make music, that he wrote lyrics in economics class, and played piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to get a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. But record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he split with his friend. In the end, he became famous behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not come. He says, ‘In my artist career, I was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, I was in the right place at the right time.’ Writing for others is where he found success. He says, ‘I think I am one of the main writers in the UK that labels send new artists to.’ This helps start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that writing with the charts in mind is okay. He asks, ‘Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?’ He believes they should write songs that are amazing and sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone speak honestly about wanting to write number one songs. Jamie is not arrogant; he just knows he wants to write hits and has the talent to do it. He focuses on writing the best music. ‘When I go into the studio, we need to aim for global success and write the best music of next year. It’s not just about being cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.’"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online, but people who don't watch online videos of bike stunts might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist.' This means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online.

I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many local boys and even older people knew him and called him a 'legend.' After watching his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, Tony explained what he wanted to do, and I wasn't always sure he could do it. But he did, and when I praised him, he didn't seem very excited. Even though he is famous online, Tony doesn't like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans and prefers doing stunts instead of talking about them.

Tony's fame comes from social media and new camera technology. This technology helps him make a living from his videos. He sometimes feels that people focus too much on cameras and screens, but he doesn't complain. Thanks to his videos, he earns money from what used to be just a hobby.

From my experience with top athletes, I know that two things are important to become great: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent. In risky sports, you need mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times but got up and tried again until he succeeded.

Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport. They don't know the technical details or that he gets expert advice to stay safe. Tony is careful about risks. He says some people never feel scared, but he does. He finds a way to overcome fear. He plans and prepares a lot before trying a new stunt. He knows he must stay calm and focused to succeed."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert in high-wire walking. Even though she had some circus skills, she found high-wire walking very different. ‘The training was a surprise,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know I needed to be so strong. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, then an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could continue if I slipped. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterward. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ But this experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he wrote a book about traveling around Canada in a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a normal touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 because of a knee injury, he finally started his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and had to stay in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for hospital bills or to go back home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, and my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better plans to protect their habitat. The work is hard. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have to take a boat to some areas and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather is not always good – some nights are mild, but often it is wet. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what we will do in the summer – spending hours in a lab to look at our results. It will be hard to stay inside, but it is important to do this. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it. But it's true! I work by eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from my company. Every week, I get small samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I also give samples to my colleagues, which makes them happy! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. Every day is different in this job. Sometimes I am in our food lab, and other times I travel to buy raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety and the fact that there is no routine, although I think I love the chocolate even more! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I still enjoy eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how they are doing. Sophia says, “For a circus career, performers need to do different things all the time – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or only work for a short time each year. But the real issue is planning for the future because you can only travel with the circus while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many past students have started businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but a lot of fun!”"
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you have probably heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She helps the main singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers, but that is not true. They often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music world!

Mariam says, ""What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I will be asked to sing. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes, it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job.""

""Excellent musical skills are very important for my work, and I need to learn quickly. There is often no written music to look at. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are long enough already.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers do not always know which musical range is best for a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to make it better."""
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only a little fashion knowledge. She created a successful company selling 'satchels,' which are traditional school bags. These bags are now sold in famous stores and are popular with celebrities. Before choosing to make satchels, Julie thought about different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She didn't just go with her first idea. When she chose satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She worked with her family from the beginning, especially her mother, who had a natural talent for business. The design of the bags came from children's storybooks. Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her a lot. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To get more interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest grew. Her company now makes satchels faster. Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity is pictured with a satchel. Instead of spending money on online ads, she uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh. There was a difficult time when another company copied her design. Now, she makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. People say her office has a positive atmosphere, and employees love working there. There is a new factory, but it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her swimming coach thought she could become a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to balance training with schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky thought it looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily go to training after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, at 28, she stopped competing. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a group.’ The charity uses famous people to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people aren’t sure if having celebrities is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it to promote themselves, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. Her parents were not musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. But Ana felt the teacher didn’t listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her feelings. She posted it online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the words each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn’t know the company and didn’t want anyone telling her what to sing. Joss convinced her this wouldn’t happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was an amazing night. Ana says she prefers writing songs about difficult times because there is more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him unhappy. While she hopes fans like her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go too, and he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather forecast said the seas would be calm when we were there. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about what needed to be done. But Harry promised he had taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our few supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide said that very few people lived along that coast. On the first morning, the only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far. So, I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop worrying about time. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like stress-free living!

When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss my family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that watching so many games would make me love basketball, but it did the opposite. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the game. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing a real game. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I agreed to play against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it went well in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I didn’t have much time with friends because of training, so that part didn’t change much. I got used to my new life, and my English got better quickly!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after moving to the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to fix that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I thought about different jobs and decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and was surprised by how much I liked it. I saw my city in a new way through the eyes of tourists. After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed a lot more knowledge to get a tour guide license. In Chicago, guides must answer many questions about the city, like its buildings, history, and public transport rules. After some hard but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping the group together. You need other skills too. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems. I make sure visitors are happy with my tours because bad reviews online can hurt my business. Good reviews bring more customers. I work hard to make my tours fun and stress-free. My energy and enthusiasm help me get good reviews, and people often recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. But in the end, we did not need to worry.

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I liked most was the evening. We walked with the elephants into the forest where they stayed at night. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so it was small. We chose to share because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, we talked and played games with the other volunteers and staff.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I am not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy her time there fully. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day—I definitely will!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different people. Some people buy flowers for their friends or homes, but we also have other customers. Hotels and offices like to have flowers in their Reception areas. Sometimes, we help with photo sessions for businesses by giving them flowers for their advertising pictures. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping at that time, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark, but I don’t mind because I am excited about my work. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The colors and smells make it hard to choose. If I chose for myself, I would only get pink flowers because it is my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what other people want are not always the same. Sometimes, I cannot find the flowers that customers want because not all flowers are available all year.

I don’t really like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it is part of the job. Flowers are not cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then, we make flower bunches and calculate how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to choose different flowers. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That is what you have to do when you sell things, and I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the new films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It is close to where I live. But a year ago, I felt something was missing – talking about a film with a group of people after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we pick a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the perfect atmosphere for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier for us, especially now that we have our own equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything is online, so we don’t worry about empty seats! There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great time, it feels wonderful. The website has helped us a lot, and we are now in contact with other film clubs across the country. We have visited other clubs to see how they do things, but it’s always nice to come back to our own club! We’ve started a blog too, because most people now look online for information about films instead of reading local newspapers. We’ve also tried putting up posters in cafés. But nothing works as well as people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we do with each film – last month we had a movie quiz, and everyone enjoyed it."
71,"When I was a child, taking photographs was my favorite thing to do. When I turned 15, I wanted to make my hobby more serious. So, I started a special project: I decided to take one photo every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to other people. I was surprised to find out that some people liked how I took pictures. I enjoyed taking photos of many different things. Then, someone suggested that my project would be better if all my photos had a common theme. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were in black and white, which was different from other young photographers who took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost stopped. But I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I will never forget when the judges said I won first prize; I was so happy because my project was important to me. It was the first time I thought my photography might be good enough to become a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I am happy with my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called 'leaders' run them. When you finish each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure about it because I had joined that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate.

Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made good relationships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week and I really look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about this before starting at the club. In fact, I had never thought about my future job, and the idea of youth work never came to my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly started to love snowboarding and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but I still love competing and winning. This helps me try harder. I like not having a fixed plan. Once, I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn't sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I started. This made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying because there is no snow. I train every day, but I don't have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. This helps me when I can't snowboard, which I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also want to have another option in case I don't become a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I can find time for college. I can't imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can't do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a valuable lesson from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't like it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I thought it would be hard, but it was easier than I expected. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. I wanted to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists come to my town, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just my mum and me at the market stall! That's when I knew it could work, and I decided to make a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our market stall too. It has been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia, which became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, ""Because of my dad’s job, my family moved around a lot, so I got good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how Amelia, the main character, does in a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to imagine that part."" Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mom always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a good way for Janine to spend her time. The year before, she won first prize in a short story competition on a young writers’ website. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters in the story face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer says that even though Janine is young and her book isn’t very long, she is a better writer than some other popular authors. Janine is still getting used to being famous: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me on the street, but now it’s OK. I’d like to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just hang out with my friends, and soon I have something interesting to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! It all started when my dad got a job as the castle's manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and keeps them open for people to visit. He was happy because he thought he might not get such a great chance again, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our nice home across the water, and there was no school. But after we moved, we quickly got used to living on the island. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. In summer, the island feels lively because many visitors come, and there are often parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers as I hoped. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which is often hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days with big waves – but the ferries don't run then! And if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is a problem. So when friends come home with me, I always tell them to hurry up! But we often see amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it's so foggy you can't see anything, then a few hours later it's sunny again – it's still surprising when that happens, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do get bad storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle is strong enough to stay safe. But then I remember it's been here for hundreds of years – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby called birdwatching. I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural home. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They taught me how to tell different bird species apart and where to find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we came back home, I joined a local club for young birdwatchers. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am almost there. During family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list. I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I might see my 200th bird species there. I didn’t feel too bad when it didn’t happen because I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about my challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fun hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I wasn’t nervous until just before I went on stage. I knew what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I did well and they enjoyed it. I might do another one next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then stopped them, so they probably thought I would do the same with football. But I didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee noticed I was a good player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. She was impressed and asked me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But I started training with a big club when I was just 13. I got much better. Even so, some people didn’t think I would become a star player, which made me a bit sad. But the coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in one of the club’s important matches earlier than I thought! I ran very hard because I didn’t want the other players to blame me if we lost. Then, by luck, I scored the winning goal. Even with the big crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, the team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. We want to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to think they can play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few bad times, so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"In recent years, universities in the UK and around the world have started encouraging students to get involved in research early in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a natural way to learn and build skills. Research skills are useful not only in school but also in jobs because they help us think about the world and our work. As a student, you help create knowledge. You don't just learn and repeat it; you make it. Creating knowledge means asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are part of what we call research.

Research can be very complex and done by experts, but it can also be simple and part of everyday life. For example, when you plan a holiday, grow plants, fix things at home, or choose the right music system, you are doing research. In college, you are expected to have an enquiring mind, find problems and questions, explore information, and create your own ideas. Some students might find this hard because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as something you get from teachers and books without questioning it. But in the UK, US, and many other places, questioning knowledge and authorities is important.

Critical thinking is very important in research. We need to not just repeat what we read but think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. We should not just accept information without questioning it."
80,"Cities have always been places where people share ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities can be creative places, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains. They have found that living in a city can make us think less clearly. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees. Even a small view of nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from city life.

More people now live in cities than ever before. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a busy city requires our brains to pay attention to many things, like other people and traffic. This constant focus uses a lot of our brain's energy.

Natural places, on the other hand, do not need as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature helps our brains relax and recover. Natural settings capture our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens.

People have long known that cities can be overwhelming. Philosophers and landscape architects have tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can quickly improve brain function. While people try many things to boost brain power, like energy drinks or changing office designs, simply walking in nature can be more effective.

Despite the challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. They remain centers of new ideas and creativity. Research shows that the busy and crowded nature of cities also leads to innovation. Just like 18th-century London, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are successful creative centers. The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people want to leave nature and return to the city."
81,"Where should we look for the mind? Many people think that the mind is only inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain scans to show this. However, I believe that the mind is not just in the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, that objects and tools also play a part in how we think. Archaeology shows that things like stone tools, jewelry, and writing have helped shape human evolution and the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head can also be part of the mind.

It is easy to think that the mind and the brain are the same because most studies focus on the brain alone. This is because brain scans require people to be away from their usual surroundings. But much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I am not saying that the brain is not important, but that the mind is more than just the brain. Human intelligence might extend into our culture and the things around us.

This idea is part of a theory I developed called Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking process. For example, when we use clay to make numbers or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how these processes have changed over time and what that means for our thinking.

Think of a blind person using a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The stick becomes part of the person, helping them ""see"" through touch. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. This shows how flexible the human mind is. Our intelligence can change and adapt by using new tools and technology.

I see the human mind as always evolving. Throughout history, tools like stone tools or the internet have helped us understand and interact with the world. For humans, tools are not just for survival but for learning and discovery. This is why humans make things and how these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity, meaning our minds change as we interact with the material world.

MET offers a new way to understand how different tools, from ancient axes to modern smartphones, have shaped and changed our minds. Technology that changes the mind might sound futuristic, but humans have been using it since we first evolved."
82,"Photography is one of the most important inventions that changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography quickly became a big part of the culture. It was used in many areas like science, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians say that photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. Photography became very important in the US, and to understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, it was a mechanical process, which matched the growing interest in technology in the US. Just like steam power and railroads made the world smaller, photography brought images of the world into people's homes. Second, the camera was a tool to show personal and national identities, which were always changing. Third, the camera helped families keep a record of themselves, even if it was a bit idealized. Lastly, photographs were realistic and matched the US artists' focus on everyday life.

Photographs draw attention to what the photographer wants us to see. They are records of events, people, and things, showing what was in front of the camera. However, they also show the photographer's point of view. People often think photographs are a 'universal language,' but their meaning can be complex. A photograph's meaning can change depending on where and how it is shown, like in a newspaper or a gallery.

To understand a photograph, we need to know why it was made and how people first saw it. The same photograph can have different meanings in different places and times. In recent decades, artists like Andy Warhol have used photographs in their art in many ways. Photography has become an important part of art, working together with painting to show how we see the world."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, which includes our thoughts and feelings. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is mostly about humans. James believed human psychology has basic parts: thoughts and feelings, the physical world around us, and how we understand these things. Our knowledge is personal and comes from our own experiences, which may not always match scientific facts. 

We often act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on why people behave in certain ways, like feeling unhappy or quitting their jobs. Problems happen when people see things differently. Formal psychology tries to find the best explanations for these situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between personal thoughts and scientific facts. They study the mind and brain, but they don't fully understand how the brain works in different situations, like giving birth or watching a football game. 

Psychologists learn more by studying behavior and making guesses about what happens inside us. The mind is not easy to observe directly, so psychologists look at behavior to understand it. Psychology is like solving a puzzle, using clues from careful observation and analysis. It aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. Psychology helps us in many areas, like teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings.

Psychological questions have been around for a long time, but they have only been studied scientifically in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or looking into one's own mind, to find answers. This method has limits because it only shows a small part of the brain's work. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than just personal reflections."
84,"In a simple building in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows products that were taken off the market because almost nobody wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and the person in charge is Carol Sherry. She believes each product has its own sad story from the people who designed and sold it. 

The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who used to work in marketing, wanted to collect a library of consumer products. He began buying a sample of every new product he could find starting in the 1960s. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection mostly includes unsuccessful ones. 

Many products in the museum were created because of a culture of optimism. People in meetings might not have realized the product would fail, or they might have ignored the signs. Marketers sometimes spend more money on a failing product to try to make it sell, instead of figuring out what went wrong.

This focus on optimism is also common in the self-help industry. People believe that if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to happen. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that people often think things will go better than they actually do. Her research shows that well-balanced people are usually more optimistic about their ability to influence events than those who are depressed.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen studied whether positive thinking about the future helps people reach their goals. Her research found that thinking too much about success can actually reduce motivation. For example, people who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck says our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. Some people think ability is fixed and cannot change, while others believe it can grow with effort and challenges. People who think ability is fixed find failure very upsetting because they see it as proof they are not good enough. On the other hand, people who believe in growth see failure as a chance to improve. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles grow stronger when they are pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset can make people happier, whether or not they succeed."
85,"Sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know, but sports are changing quickly, and old ideas are being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players do their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. On the other hand, people who invest money in sports wonder if home advantage should matter. If players are paid well, shouldn't they play well anywhere?

Fans are also part of this discussion. For example, if Manchester United played some home games in Asia to reach fans there, would it matter? British fans think their support is important for the team. They believe their cheering helps the team score goals, but they often forget the times when cheering didn't lead to a goal.

One thing that seems true is that home fans can influence referees. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees might avoid making decisions that upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are very similar. However, these changes don't fully explain the data.

Home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball requires teamwork. Playing at home might boost team confidence.

Another reason for home advantage could be related to players' testosterone levels. These levels are higher before home games, which might be a natural response to defending their home ground. In the Rugby World Cup, some home teams won against stronger opponents by showing determination and aggression, which are signs of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important to athletes and their coaches. The saying is interesting because its meaning is not clear. Player did not mean he was actually lucky. He meant, ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate, which asks if talent is something you are born with or something you learn. In sports, many people believe practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said that to become an expert in any field, you need 10,000 hours of practice. This idea became popular through books like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers"" and others that say practice is more important than talent. However, in his book, Epstein argues that practice alone is not enough. He shows many examples to explain this. He says that studies often only look at successful people and try to explain why they are successful. Epstein travels around the world to find answers, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to Alaska. In Alaska, he learns that in a tough sled dog race, the dogs’ drive and desire are important, suggesting that both genes and environment matter. This means that determination might also be genetic. Epstein talks about the difference between nature (genes) and nurture (environment) and says both are important for top athletes. He does not ignore the importance of training or environment. For example, if Usain Bolt grew up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest runner. Epstein also looks at how genes are important in some cases and discusses race and gender. He asks why men and women compete separately if only practice matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most important."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her book, ""Kith,"" she explains that children spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers, and have lost touch with nature. Griffiths believes this is the main problem. 

A follow-up study talked to children and found that many would be happier if they could play outside more. People over 40 often remember their own childhoods fondly, when they spent time exploring outside, swimming, or building forts. They think this was healthier than the way children live now. However, they forget that they are the ones who have made life more protective for their children, worrying about risks.

Griffiths argues that fear of danger keeps kids indoors, which benefits the toy and gadget industry. She also criticizes trends like giving medicine to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. She questions how common these rules are but expresses her frustration clearly.

Griffiths believes children should have freedom to explore and take risks. She says kids need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are safe. She also wonders if all children want to be adventurous, as some might prefer to stay home and be cautious. The real issue might be forcing all children to live the same way, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my schooling. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play. Those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, and moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems, not just follow instructions or do routine calculations. Creative thinkers can anticipate problems before they happen. The creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play.' He imagined chasing a sunbeam to develop his theory of relativity. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring for them, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and this play helps them learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit anytime. To keep the game going, players must keep each other happy. This makes play very democratic. School has become harder: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must solve children's problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, expert warnings about dangers, less cohesive neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the trend of the past 50 years. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to play and explore to grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect directly with employers. In the past, people had to do things like stand outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign to get noticed. But with more access to employers, there is also a bigger chance to make mistakes.

For example, a young person in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts that the young person thought could help him get a job. However, the executive was not happy with this request. She did not want to share her contacts with someone she did not know. She rejected his request and sent a very harsh reply, which became popular online. Many people who saw the reply were shocked, and the executive might now regret how she responded. But this situation can teach young people to be more careful when using social media for work.

Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. This is surprising because sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of their social lives for years. When we were teenagers, social media was a place to have fun and be someone different. But using social media for work is very different, and some young people do not see the difference. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. We need to understand that what we learned about social media as teenagers does not work for finding jobs. We must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too casual and seem arrogant on professional sites. This makes older people think we feel entitled, but in reality, many young people are just trying hard to find jobs. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be good workers.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them. Maybe you can help with research or assist in another way. This approach gives you a better chance of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal messages and keep your tone humble to make a good impression. Remember, social media can help you make useful contacts, but you need to use it carefully to avoid problems."
90,"Text: 'Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people buying UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. However, old types of media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here today. Theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio is still popular even with TV, and cinema is still strong against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales up 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but it took a long time for them to become the main way people got news. This happened in the mid-19th century with new technology like the steam press, railway, and telegraph. People also started to believe that everything is always changing, and they needed regular news updates. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and big events like famines or floods. Journalism as a job you could live on didn’t really exist before the 19th century. Even then, people didn’t see why they needed news every day or week. Newspapers have a fixed format and schedule, which can be limiting. Online news lets people check news when they want and follow stories that interest them. Online news can update quickly and correct mistakes fast. There is no limit to how much can be written, and you can often see full documents or events. This is very different from newspapers. However, online news often focuses on being first and getting lots of comments, which can cause confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. In some ways, we are going back to that. Newspapers have not always been great at explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand the world better, even as the internet makes us feel like we live in a chaotic world.'"
91,"If humans were comfortable in the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy walking in the dark, just like many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This is a basic part of who we are, even if we don't often think about it. This is why we have changed the night by adding lots of light. This change, called light pollution, has effects that scientists are just starting to understand. Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design, which lets artificial light shine into the sky instead of focusing it on the ground. This extra light changes the natural darkness of night, affecting the lives of many animals, including humans. It can change things like migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

In the past, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. For example, if you walked towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, you would not see much light from the city, even though it was the largest city in the world. People used candles, torches, and lanterns, and only a few houses had gas lights. There were no streetlights yet. 

We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but many animals are active at night. Light is very powerful and can attract animals. For example, birds can be drawn to bright lights and fly around them until they are exhausted. Birds migrating at night can crash into tall, brightly lit buildings. Some birds even sing at strange times because of artificial light. 

People used to think light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. But everyone needs darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can cause health problems. Our sleep and wake cycles are connected to the natural light and dark cycles of Earth. Changing these rhythms is like changing our balance. 

In the end, humans are affected by light pollution just like animals. We have lost touch with the natural night sky and the rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, which we can best understand by looking at the stars and the Milky Way above us."
92,"The founder of a big international company recently said that his company will stop keeping track of employees' paid holiday time. This idea was inspired by an internet company that did something similar. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. Some people think this announcement is just a way to make the company look good, but we should ask: is this idea practical?

The internet company and the big international company are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the big company has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where people know each other's work better. In a big company, it might be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business.

The founder of the big company said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work is up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? Even if you prepare well before a holiday, there is always a lot of work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works. People might feel guilty about going on holiday, which can lead to stress and lower productivity over time.

There might also be pressure from coworkers about who takes time off and for how long. In many companies, especially in the corporate world, there is a culture of working late. This could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where people compete for promotions. If the feeling of safety that comes with guaranteed leave is removed, people might feel they can't take the leave they need because they don't want to seem lazy.

Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime and anywhere, making it hard to separate work from free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. They wondered why the company should track time off if it couldn't track work hours accurately. But if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might feel like they are always being watched, which can be stressful.

Employment laws exist to make sure workers get enough rest and leisure time, which is important for their health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like better morale and creativity, can happen without affecting worker well-being. So, I am not sure if letting employees ""take as much holiday as they want"" is really the goal or the likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This is to make sure the research is good and not full of mistakes. Scientists often say this process is important to keep trust in scientific work. However, reviewing a paper can take up to a year, which can delay its publication. Is this delay worth it? The answer is both yes and no. 

The world of scientific publishing is changing. I still think papers should be checked before they are published, but things are shifting. One big change is the use of preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed by experts. They allow new research to be shared quickly so others can read, comment, and build on it. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers. This can lead to authors cutting corners to get published in top journals. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good. This can depend on how interesting the topic is, not just the quality of the science. 

Many people know these problems, but few want to change the system. Preprints might be a solution because they don't require a big change from the current system. Some people think journals won't accept papers that have been shared as preprints, but this is not true. There is also a worry that sharing papers without review will lead to bad science, but this hasn't happened yet. 

Preprints are open for everyone to read and discuss, which helps improve the work. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper was a critique of another paper, which is hard to publish in traditional journals. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and everyone could see the discussion. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments are still available, so the work is not wasted.

Preprints allow for global scientific discussions and can share important negative results that journals often ignore. They also increase how often papers are read and cited. By using the internet's openness, preprints focus on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is like 'a painting in words'. These answers don't usually satisfy me or them. So, one day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist would, and another paragraph from the object's point of view, calling it 'Poem'. One student wrote: 

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. 

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. 

When I was in school, poetry often confused me. I thought poems were like puzzles that stopped me from understanding and feeling. After school, many people find poetry less interesting. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down because it seems plain or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we want from poems? Aren't they supposed to have deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever humor? The answer seems to be yes. But for tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music combines words and melody beautifully. 

However, poems can show us something important: ambiguity, or things that are not clear. Life is full of this, just like reading a poem. But this still doesn't tell us what a poem really is. If you search online for 'poem', it leads you to 'poetry': 'a form of art using the beauty and rhythm of language'. This is a fancy way to say it, but the word 'poem' comes from the Greek word 'poí?ma', meaning 'a thing made', and a poet is 'a maker of things'. 

So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes say poems are like wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or like machines – carefully made and precise. But these comparisons don't always work. The best part of comparing poems to other things is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about machines or animals. It helps us think differently and see common things in a new way. 

A poem can be like a mental object, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stay in our minds. The mix of words and music is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. But aren't words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine. A poem can have a strong impact, even though it is just ink on paper like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem? That space could be used for a longer article or ad. A poem is written and rewritten like an article or story, but it is not made to be sold. Publishers send out poetry books, but they don't expect them to make money. A poem is not for the market; it is for itself. Because of this special status, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I have enjoyed finding brooches and coins because they make me feel connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and wanted to go to a place I had in mind. But it was raining, so I went to a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I couldn't ignore it and started digging. I was on my stomach in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, like some curtain rails I found before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, patterned loop. I realized it looked like the Great Torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. 

I took it to my car and kept looking at it on the drive home. At home, I washed it in the sink. I called Marion and showed her. She was surprised. I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At night, I hid it in our wardrobe, but I was worried, so I moved it under a floorboard in my office.

The law says you must report such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before giving it up, so I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The registrar was surprised when he saw it. The torc was checked and sold to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just money; it's something I saved for the nation. People ask if I will stop detecting now that I found something so amazing. But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I won't stop while there's a chance of finding something even bigger."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy travel plans, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for naps in the afternoon and lazy mornings in bed. Sleeping better is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, I could sleep deeply and have dreams that were more enjoyable than I thought possible. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I think there's more to it than just relaxing. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. When we sleep, we process all these new experiences. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with different places. People often worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local habits is more challenging than changing time zones. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I truly belong there. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all felt sleepy and lay down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why they had so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Being in a new place, away from my usual routine, I enjoy the different smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said kindly to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking a bit like a bulldog. ""But it's so boring,"" she said. ""Everyone will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little one will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change the woman's mind. Smiling, she agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. It had been a while since everyone was together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, who they knew nothing about. Her husband Jeff had been quick to comment when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff said, ""What kind of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it's nice."" ""It sounds pretentious,"" Jeff said. He didn't like anything showy or fake. He also didn't like Mia's way of being too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said a trash can lid would look better. ""The problem with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you're too polite."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and went home. Her commute was only forty seconds because her shop was in a barn next to their house. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to turn the barn into a space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends that there was a demand for special occasion hats. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia's Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in the village of Little Pelham. In a friendly environment, they could try on many hats to find the right one. Mia also offered changing rooms and encouraged customers to bring their outfits. Recently, she started selling handbags and costume jewelry too."
98,"Lawrence Okoye has traveled a long way from London to Atlanta. He is on an exciting sports journey. Lawrence is confident, but even he is surprised by how far he has come. He was in the Olympic final for discus throwing, and now he might join a big American football team, even though he has never played the sport before. In Atlanta, he is learning about his new position in football. It seems unbelievable that a 21-year-old from London could be chosen for a top American team, but Lawrence is used to surprising people. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on discus instead. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus, aiming for the world championships. He thought about American football before, but it seemed crazy. When he got to the USA, he decided to try it. He read about NFL trials in Atlanta and applied, even though he had never played before. He wasn't nervous about competing with experienced players. His test results were impressive, and he was noticed as the best player. Lawrence is proud but also careful. He knows he has a lot to learn. Coaches say he has the right skills, and it depends on how hard he works. He is relaxed about whether he will be selected for the team. He learned from his Olympic experience, where he came last in the final but was happy to qualify. Lawrence doesn't let setbacks stop him. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, which is a big motivation. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Some people think he should focus on one sport, but he wants to follow his dreams. If football doesn't work out, he can return to discus, which he loves. Every choice he makes is well thought out."
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green made me feel better because, even though it was mid-September, it had not started snowing in Siberia yet. I saw no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to a remote area to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as bad as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I told him I believed there was a road, though not many people used it now. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and said ""Holodna"" (cold) while pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, but I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students sitting without much energy. Some were taking notes. The lecturer kept talking. I was thinking about a problem. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling. Plus, there were long holidays to go on adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He loved adventure after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest challenge so far. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would be too much for him. Even though it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the people who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns flying through tall pylons, which are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to take part in this race. 

An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first said I was in good health, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. I was told, ""The horizon is your best friend,"" and the pilot would tell me where to look. I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. When we were moving down the runway, my legs were up, and I tried not to touch the important steering pedals or switches. I decided not to relax and enjoy the flight, even though I was told to. In high-speed flying, you need to stay calm and focused. You have to tense and relax at the right times. Panicking is not good.

As we started down the runway, Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we quickly turned right. It was a strong move, and I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and took short breaths. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, making my stomach feel like it was left behind. Soon, we were flying 10 meters above the ground, going between two pylons at 400 km per hour. My excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even started the acrobatics yet.

For two minutes, I got to fly the plane. My hand was shaking, and the plane shook too because it was so responsive. Then Dario said something, but instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I said. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying in a full circle. Some people might find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, when we were upside down, I heard a voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw fields.

The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience in a race. To show this, Dario ate sandwiches happily after we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed about doing loops again and again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you've seen amazing videos of polar bears in nature documentaries, he probably filmed them. He likes temperatures of -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. 'I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.' He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife series. 'I started at a good time. When I began, not many people had been to the Antarctic. There were people who focused on coral, elephants, or chimpanzees. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed.' The camera and communication technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. 'It is easier to film today. If you filmed something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can film a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you missed. You filmed less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.' 'My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases, or mosquitoes.' Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a world of polar bears and is very dangerous. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very hard. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. 'We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim in very cold water and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic for a new expedition that he says is even more challenging. Explorers are confident and determined people, and they need to be. This time, there is more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer journey to the North Pole. They will take detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be very important for scientists. This will show what global warming is doing to the ice in the polar region. Pen was trained for this job. As a child, he was cared for by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She toughened him up by sending him out into blizzards with little clothing. His father gave him a love for frozen adventures, and Pen had great physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he is at home because he is often thinking about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horses compete against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. Pen says it is harder to leave them this time. When he last went, his children were one and five years old. He told his son to take care of the family, which was too much pressure for him. So, this time, Pen plans to have little contact with them while he is in the Arctic. He is spending his last days before leaving preparing his equipment carefully. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer, will join him. They will have a team of six people flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for Pen, and he is also worried because he is turning 47 and has not trained as much as he would like. He says organizing things always seems more urgent. Pen believes his mission is important because it helps scientists understand the Arctic. He says that reaching the North Pole was a personal goal, but this time, the data will help scientists, and they want to involve as many people as possible in learning about the Arctic Ocean. He feels that their skills are now very useful for society."
103,"Text: I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. These activities were great, but I missed having a big competition. I wanted to stay fit in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. I knew if I joined the race, I would want to win. Would Ben be the best partner to win? Probably not. But being an underdog with no pressure sounded interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat deposit, making the race possible. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete. It's nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I could talk about something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but it was straightforward. I trained almost every day, but the program was set, and there were doctors and dieticians. I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I was afraid it would look like I just wanted to be on TV. My worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. But he couldn't row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. I was 26 and feeling restless. I wanted to see the Arctic landscapes, with their cold and empty spaces, maybe because I was tired of the noise and crowds in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to let me work as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow. These rides can last from an hour to five days. The company started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm', which is a simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They said I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away.

November 6, London On my flight, I try to memorize the names of more than 100 huskies, but I feel distracted and nervous. I stop looking at the page and gaze out of the window instead. People say that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. But I feel like I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus ride north is just what I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrive at the farm after dark and am quickly given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking sounds, which get louder as I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, getting the huskies ready and attaching them to sleds. The dogs are very excited, pulling hard on the ropes because they want to go. I can hardly hear to introduce myself, and the others are too busy to talk much. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and suddenly we are off into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I have to answer some tough questions about what I can do for the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I don’t know. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not very useful: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, feeling relieved. The basics of dog-sledding are easy to learn: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and giving water to the dogs become hard in the freezing weather. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is full of instructions, and my muscles ache from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I feel proud. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe ran past the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that she could have competed in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about a natural treatment called emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she didn't really realize how big her achievement was at the time. She felt it was just what she was supposed to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep up the fast pace. Hartmann was upset by this, but he understood why someone might think it was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast and still managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would beat that time soon. Radcliffe thought she would try again next year, but it didn't happen. After the race, people wondered how she, with her awkward running style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her for weeks, helping her with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said she could handle a lot of pain. Hartmann traveled 13 hours from Ireland to her training place in France, and when he arrived, her husband said, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no time for a break; she wanted a two-hour session right away. Hartmann gave so much time to Radcliffe that other athletes felt left out. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has beaten her record? ‘Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people race each other more than themselves.’ She means she always pushed herself, even when she was winning. Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the best of her career. She never ran that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" came out, I didn't know how people would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I believed our show was a new and exciting part of that change. But I was worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, memories, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my restaurant experiences. Each project feels like a journey, whether it's about the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often a real one, with travel and meeting new people. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest book, where you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best golden pasta. These people have spent years trying to reach their own idea of perfection. Perfection is different for everyone. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish wasn't included. But after long meetings, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of what perfection is, based on their feelings, memories, and surroundings. I knew from the start that I wasn't saying these recipes were the best ever. But I thought that by using my skills and talking to food experts, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV series let me explore new foods, people, and places, which was very exciting. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. Some adventures included visiting a factory that had the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that wasn't good enough to film. To perfect each recipe, I even hand-milked a cow, used dry ice to make ice cream, cooked chicken in a hospital machine, and almost set my house on fire trying to make a pizza oven hot enough!"
107,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field, stopping suddenly. John got out and looked at the engine, but after a while, he admitted, ""I don’t know what I’m doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried and said, ""We can’t stay here forever."" The field was big, with just grass and flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was usually best to be on her side. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. John went to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay on the grass and asked me to tell a story. Bea lay down too, so I told them about hearing two birds talking in London. They talked about breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. They even argued about a worm. Bea said, ""That’s silly, no one understands bird language."" I said I did, but I wasn’t sure anymore. Mum had fallen asleep. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped push the van to a hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out, but the boys didn’t mind and waved at her. We went into a café near the road. John whispered, ""It’s a hotel. It might be expensive."" Mum said, ""We’ll just have some tea,"" and we sat on the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum said, ""It’s like syrup."" We stayed there all day while John tried to fix the van. He said, ""It’s a miracle it got us this far,"" as it got dark. Mum made a bed for us outside in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. John said, ""I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech."" Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John driving it. Bea didn’t want to move, so John carried her to the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we’d get home since our van needed to be towed. I thought maybe we could take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like Lucy. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city. Lucy didn't hear her name clearly because of the noise, but it was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to talk about the music they were playing and their travel plans.

Lucy told them, ""I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer."" It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She didn't want to do many of the things that filled her time, like concerts and competitions. These events took her around the world and made her miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. Her dad had bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. Lucy hadn't applied to the festival herself; her mom had done it for her. Her mom said, ""I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in."" Lucy thought it was more like her mom didn't want her to say no.

The guy from Tokyo asked, ""Tanglewood?"" Lucy said, ""Yeah."" He asked, ""How old are you?"" ""Fifteen,"" she replied. He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't mean to brag. It was hard to know when she was just sharing information or showing off. She explained, ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're going to try..."" Liesel/Louisa excused herself to talk to someone else. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, ""Have you ever been to Japan?"" He had long, shaggy hair, like many musician guys, to show they were cool. Lucy said, ""Once. When I was, like, eight."" He was about to reply when Lucy's grandfather came over. ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,"" he said, pulling her away. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition."" Lucy said, ""They're not the competition."" Her grandfather replied, ""Everyone is the competition.""

Her grandfather took her around the room to talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she only heard about half of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ""You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" Lucy liked being somebody, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special to the kids she used to go to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro well. But in places like this festival, she knew she mattered."
109,"""It's not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,"" said Dad. It's hard to argue with him, so I wanted to see what experts say about it. It's quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of who they are, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a big part of modern childhood. Teenagers don't just use media for things like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do; they live in it. It's not good or bad – it depends on how you use it.

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it's like hanging out at a youth club, which today's parents did when they were younger. It's a virtual youth club where teenagers can develop their identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and get along with friends.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says adolescence is a time to ask, ""Who am I?"" Social networking can help you find your identity. You can share your favorite music or sports, discover what you like, and see that others have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don't use social media. He says social media can help if you're shy because online communication can be easier than face-to-face, and you can practice social skills in a less scary environment.

Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help quiet people with special interests connect with others who like the same things. If only a few people at your school like a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group with similar interests, you can feel popular in a different way.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online and create their own content are using social networks well. She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force. Teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity. Photographers can connect, learn, share images, and deepen their interest. This helps with jobs and will be useful at work. Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness, so you need to understand how it works. If you have 1000 friends on social networks, they could be customers for a product you create. Linking these networks gives you a customer base.

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working, agrees Matthews. Many sites offer the chance to work with others to create and share content. Collaboration is a key skill for the 21st century and important for being employable in a digital age."""
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they probably don't imagine a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. But my parents had a different idea for our summer vacation this year. My dad planned what many teenagers would call a nightmare: a big family road trip. Before the trip, my parents kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There's probably a good reason why!""

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough room left for us, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home for smaller places to stay over the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into.

We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way!

The next day, we were up early and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We visited the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. As we climbed to our next stop, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we went, we saw a mix of old and new. We got used to dealing with construction traffic. We laughed when we saw the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument.

We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common. We had a close encounter with a bear on the road, which gave us unforgettable memories.

As we continued, life back home seemed far away. Even the old hotel we stayed in, with its problems, didn't ruin our excitement. It was a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service, but it had the most amazing views. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to a faraway place to find something special. It was nice to be home again, and I was happy that I hadn't fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our trip to look through and remember. For me, the best memories were the unplanned and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living at the college under the care of the Head. She was happy because she got the best room with a kitchen and study area, plus free Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would still watch over Amy.

Rose was moving to her grandmother's house. She only had some holiday memories of her grandmother and never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not very excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn't know why her parents didn't get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Rose last saw her grandmother when she was ten, and her memories were happy.

Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked to bring people together. Rose expected dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady and seemed to go to more social events than the Queen of England.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. But Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play loud music, invite friends over, or go out without asking for permission every time. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose's mother gave her a new touch-screen phone with a video camera for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were problems, they would talk about it.

Rose was not a wild child. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this was the last time because she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed difficult. At 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. When she told her old teacher, the teacher was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn’t see why she should wait if she could be good at it now.

I met Charlotte at her publisher's office. Even though I knew she was only 15, I was surprised to see such a young person. Her book is impressive: the story is strong and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, shows it was written by a teenager. A public relations person was with us in case Charlotte needed help, but she didn’t. Charlotte is confident and smart, but also calm.

Charlotte knows she is young and doesn’t have all the answers. She says she wanted to ask big questions in her book, not answer them. She laughs and says she doesn’t have many life lessons to share. She was interested in the idea of taking responsibility.

Charlotte thinks teenagers are often shown in books in three ways: as outsiders who become accepted, as naïve and knowing nothing, or as socially awkward. She found this annoying because not all teenagers fit these types. She believes this can make teenagers doubt themselves.

Charlotte loves reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. Their books explore deep ideas, and she wondered if she could do the same. However, she found a book called ""How Not to Write a Novel"" helpful. It taught her that if readers can guess what happens next, the suspense is lost.

Some might think Charlotte’s parents, who are journalists, helped her get published. Her father knew someone in publishing, which helped her book get read. She knows she was lucky because getting a first novel read is hard. But she believes that after getting a chance, a writer’s success depends on their talent. She doesn’t take her success for granted."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, wanted to show he knew what he was doing. He went first, skiing down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew into the air, but something looked wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I liked practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it, and I was afraid of being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes – not a real introduction to what we’d face on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down again. Land in the right zone, and you keep moving forward. Land on the flat, and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs would almost stop as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed right. Gareth was as happy as I was, and I felt proud. But that didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I kept my speed, jumped, and landed in the right zone. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight as the ride stops and then slowly goes up. There is a pause, and then a fast drop makes your stomach feel funny. You move quickly forward, turn left, and go upside down. Everything is a blur, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose to be there, like many others who visit theme parks every year.

Amusement parks are a big business because people love exciting rides. To make these rides, there are big teams of engineers and designers working hard. They create rides that are fun and a little scary but safe. Designing rollercoasters is not easy. It is about finding the right mix of fun and fear and making sure people want to come back for more.

Many of the ideas used in rollercoasters today were invented by John Miller in the early 1900s. Back then, rides were more extreme, but now designers have to follow rules and use certain track designs.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, who studies thrills, said the skill is in putting the ride pieces together. Dr. John Roberts explained that it is about making people feel like they are being thrown around but still safe. The best rides tell a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and use new ideas like the tallest or fastest ride to make it exciting.

Professor Walker said that designing rollercoasters is about using experience and trying new things. Jeff Hornick, who works in theme park development, agreed that you need to love thrills to design good rides and test them before people use them.

I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said that while new technology is exciting, the real rollercoaster experience will always be the most important part."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both with her busy schedule. She says, ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio and take orders from strict choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day.’ As a choreographer, she teaches and likes working with young students. ‘New dancers are open to trying new ideas. In some ways, it’s easier to work with students than professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed but don’t fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This means they accept even tough criticism. They might still question me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There might be music I don’t like, but I still try to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose new music. I’d like to be more experimental and switch music when rehearsals are tough. But now, I work on big productions where the music is already decided by the composer and can’t be changed.’

Miranda doesn’t want to stay with one institution. ‘I think it’s important to meet new people. But I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. So, I need to adapt my work each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’

We talk about a recent documentary on ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘Some documentaries look glamorous but are misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one tries to show the real life inside a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I recognized it. She knows she’s not doing it right but can’t make her body do it. It’s hard to watch but not fake. People don’t realize how much work and dedication ballet requires.’

I ask what makes a great dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to ask, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can cover a few wrong choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance is great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. That’s disappointing.’

Miranda has done many different works, so I ask if she sees herself as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. ‘People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s a trend to focus on one area, but I don’t follow it. Maybe one day I’ll be known for one thing, but for now, I want to explore more.’"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation gave me the idea for a fun four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main part of the film. I added three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to hold it. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to continue. I have been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I often told people, ""No, I'm not doing it for charity, and I'm not training for a marathon."" When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I prefer to explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port was curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. He still looked puzzled, but he smiled and showed me on board. Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us all the time, and they made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first real 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was happy when I finally did it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. We hardly needed the support boat. I can’t wait to come again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but I love it. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. This makes it a great job for a young person like me!

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school in another country, so I often flew alone. I felt lonely and asked the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers. Some of them let me help. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and try something new.

At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people, and many were accepted. They were often well-qualified like me and wanted to change careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and past work experience, not just that I loved to travel. I got the job!

I recommend this job to anyone because there are many good things about it. The free flights are nice, but they are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and we have a saying: ""No one’s finished till everyone’s finished."" It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I don’t have to think about work. If I have difficult passengers, which doesn’t happen often, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won’t see them again."
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children do things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement, they try it and all of them reach the top in the end. This makes them feel very happy. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home. Surprisingly, it's not the very young ones who miss home the most, but the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's a bit late to call now, do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time.

It's not always the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call us a lot, asking how their child is doing, which is not really needed. Often, their son or daughter is busy playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back later.

We often see a certain type of child coming to camp, usually wearing expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won ‘Best Musical’ four times! Doing the show with only British actors was difficult. In the UK, young actors can do fewer shows each week than in the USA, so they needed twice as many actors. Luckily, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night because people want to hear the songs that were first popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. ‘It’s great that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have normal school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found an extra one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! While the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is really worth seeing.'"
