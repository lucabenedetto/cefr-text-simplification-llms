1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just telling people, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you are also letting everyone know you are not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This made people more aware that there could be negative sides to sharing too much online. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering possibilities like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize that the online world is crowded and risky, and we can get lost. This might sound depressing, but don't lose hope. There is a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the internet and faced many challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of fame, all before social media existed. These early bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While his work was very open, it also had a certain beauty that some might call art. One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem of sharing too much online remains. Sharing online is great, but if you think it will make people like you more, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to all the vice presidents at her company, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that while the internet lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.

At first, the film seemed harmless. It showed scientists saying that new discoveries are revealing the universe to be stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of a water molecule could be changed by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing, but many scientists do not. They want solid proof that thoughts can affect water, and pretty pictures are not enough.

The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force expanding the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research. Scientists have discovered that the universe is made of unknown matter and is being pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Other discoveries are also amazing. Neuroscientists found that our perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this out so we don't notice. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans first lived and why they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's design.

Science is not close to being complete. In fact, we are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some top physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people think the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is enjoyable. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both are important and create a complete picture that I value. The trees provide shade and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colors attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started writing, I have switched between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories, and after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two because they might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but memorable. Writing short stories expanded my fictional world, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is nice because they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story, though I might revise it many times. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You can finish a short story quickly and move on. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I'll finish. So, writing short stories is a good change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It's like jazz improvisation, where the story leads you. Also, with short stories, you don't have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn't work, you can just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. This is comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in your next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories' successes and failures. Short stories are like experiments for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be harder. My short stories are like shadows or footprints I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like signs to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is clear to experts, but its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and its mistakes are either ignored or exaggerated. 

Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced by new ones. Like in music, new ideas are sometimes mocked before they become accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. The history of science is about these conflicts. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. We will admire the creativity of these ideas but also question them, recognizing both their brilliance and their limits.

Science is always changing. Scientists often disprove each other's theories. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics challenged this view, showing that observing the universe can change it. Some people think this shows science can't fully explain the universe, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing.

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people think we are close to a complete theory of everything. Maybe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the world their children will live in and the kind of children they will have. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. Deciding how to use science is not just for philosophers; it affects national budgets, health, and even the future of life on Earth."
5,"Since around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed book. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about new technologies and changes. Historically, whenever a new technology appears, people often predict the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. In 1894, some thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, television, and smartphones, all thought to threaten print books at some point. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the book's death often appears during technological changes, reflecting our hopes and fears about these changes. We form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we bond with objects like books, TVs, and computers, sometimes even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers comes along, it not only brings economic and social changes but also affects our bond with familiar things. As technology advances, we often miss what we used to have, which is why industries around retro products and older technologies thrive. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people sought original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have made people appreciate the physical quality of old books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power to change and our resistance to it. We often use familiar story patterns, like tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the book's death reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our personal world and identity."
6,"For a year and a half, almost every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest minds in the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By focusing on the simple details of their daily lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I aimed to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to paint a picture of these artists as regular people with habits, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the conditions for creativity, not the creative work itself. It’s about how things are made, not what they mean. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about your inner self. My book explores questions I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while also making a living? Is it better to focus entirely on a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is short, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions, as they might only be solved individually. But I’ve tried to show how different successful people have faced these challenges. I wanted to demonstrate how big creative ideas are built from small daily actions and how work habits affect the work itself. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about routines. A routine might seem ordinary, but it can be a powerful tool for using limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can help focus your mental energy and keep you from being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, James himself often procrastinated and couldn’t stick to a schedule. This book was actually born from my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was at work trying to write a story due the next day, but instead, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a morning person, focused in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for other writers’ work schedules. I found them easily and thought someone should collect these stories, which led to my Daily Routines blog and now this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the variety of voices that made the blog popular. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of an increase in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. From then on, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of university, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was interested in the very early history of life, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied ancient, delicate creatures in grey rocks. 

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job, especially in the kind of place he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving something doesn't always mean you get it. The process of getting an academic job can be unfair. When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied, but he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had a fight with his wife, crashed his car, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and the professor who replaced him wanted to block the appointment of the first professor's favorite candidate. This led to Howard getting the job. Howard was surprised and grateful, but later a colleague explained what really happened. Howard was a little disappointed but happy to have the job he wanted.

Howard often thought about how his work life was organized and planned, unlike the chaos of personal life. He realized that strangers could change your life, like when his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he went back to the college, postponed the lecture, and reported the theft. Then he had coffee with a colleague and a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils there, which would be his biggest challenge and secure his career. If his briefcase hadn't been stolen, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. In his office at Oxford University, he mentions having ice cream made from bee larvae at home. Although they look like maggots, they taste 'slightly nutty and floral.' Making bug-eating normal is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. His research influences what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurants. This field of study is called gastro physics. It looks at how different factors, like who we eat with or the color of our plates, affect our taste experience. 

Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, shares many interesting insights. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most. Also, we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others. 

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and not high-tech. It has soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford their own research. Much of his funding comes from a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was not seen as 'proper science' in universities. But now, universities are encouraged to show that their work has real-world impact. 

Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar in their products, often without customers noticing. Research shows that if people know about these changes, they focus on the taste and might not like it as much. 

Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a big food company. Together, they created the 'Sound of the Sea' dish, which combines sound and flavor. Spence found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. 

At home, Spence's dinner parties are quite unique. Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery, and another time they used remote-controlled lights. They have also experimented with different sounds and drinks to see how they affect taste. For Spence, home, shops, and food events are all part of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, fake facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows. Smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried something will fall. Even though we think we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can make our thinking unclear. Multitasking also creates a craving for new things, distracting us. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to focus, is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former professor of psychology, calls it info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while an unread email is in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This loss is greater than the loss from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is hard on our brains. Small decisions use the same brain resources as big ones, leading to poor decisions. In talking with business leaders and scientists, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not about email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other things done."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can't find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not considered important. Scientists focused on animal behaviors and their outcomes, not on whether animals have feelings or moral systems. But recently, this has started to change. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has led to popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". These books have started a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a conscience, a sense of right and wrong? 

In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Those that opened the gate themselves showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we produce and eat beef? The observations are clear, but their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the edge of a major ethical change, like the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, says we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler version of our mind. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. The disagreement is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is very difficult, can we ever know what it is like to be a bat, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asked?

Balcombe describes an important experiment he did that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with lots of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups were first fed tasty worms from one box and bad-tasting worms from another, and they learned to eat only from the tasty box. Later, when only bad-tasting worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear opinion. He says, ""We look back with horror at times of racism. Our view on animals will be the same one day. We can't support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger."" If Balcombe were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his view. Manning, who wrote a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour,"" says, ""We are seeing a change. In the early 20th century, some thought animals were just like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are swinging back. But it is a controversial topic, and you want to avoid the noise of academics with personal opinions."""
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way of understanding what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that people often think arguments help find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, it might also change how we solve complex problems, making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are surrounded by a lot of poor but attractive ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Surprisingly, having more data doesn't always lead to better knowledge or decisions.

The National Endowment for the Arts reports that reading literature has dropped by 10%, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media, like TV and video games, might reduce critical thinking. She says that less reading might be linked to this decline because people now focus more on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing.

We don't yet have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. Technology's impact is complex, and it can be both good and bad. For example, a computer game might help or harm critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis skills, but constantly clicking on links might prevent deeper thinking. Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers, says that technology changes how we think. Reading helps imagination and critical thinking, while visual media can improve some information processing but often don't allow time for reflection.

Many young people might not reach their full potential because of how they use technology. Society's view of technology affects how we think about critical thinking. Video games are a good example of this conflict. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games can be a great learning tool, not just entertainment. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in realistic virtual worlds. These games allow players to explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise.

In today's digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who used to work in an office and for social policy institutions. He left that life because he was unhappy with it. He wrote a book about the benefits of manual work and another book about dealing with modern life. Crawford got the idea for his latest book when he noticed ads appearing on a credit card machine while he was shopping. He realized that these ads and other distractions are hard to avoid and make it difficult for us to focus on what we want. This constant interruption makes us less likely to talk to strangers and more likely to isolate ourselves.

Crawford says that we often experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us. These distractions can take over our lives. Many people, like office workers who complain about emails but spend their free time on them, are worried about this. Studies show that just having a phone visible can distract us. While there's no scientific proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, we are more aware of other things we could be doing.

Crawford believes that technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves, which affects our social lives. We prefer texting to talking because it's easier. By only interacting with digital versions of people, we might lose important social skills. Crawford gives the example of his gym, where people used to share music but now listen to their own with earbuds. This change has made the gym less social.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he thinks we should engage in skilled activities that connect us with the real world. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real situations. These activities require good judgment and interaction with others. Engaging with the real world makes digital experiences seem less important.

Crawford doesn't think everyone should become a chef, but he believes it's important to use our judgment. Focusing on one thing can help us concentrate better on other things too."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question we ask each other. We often define ourselves by our jobs, and usually, we answer this question in a few words. But when you're a philosopher, like me, it's a bit more complicated. Calling yourself a philosopher can sound pretentious. Saying you study or teach philosophy is fine, but saying you are a philosopher might make people think you claim to know some special truth. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. So why do people have this stereotype about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others' actions and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, was the best life. Not many modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked to thinking deeply. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living,’ meaning that just accepting what society says is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices. But living an examined life doesn't mean you have to read a lot of philosophy books or spend all your time thinking. It means looking closely at your daily life to make sure it is meaningful. You don't have to be a wise person living away from society to do this. In fact, examining life is practical and should be shared with others because it's important for a good life. Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become very separate from everyday life, especially for people who haven't studied it formally. This isn't entirely philosophers' fault: universities focus on expensive and hard-to-access journals. So, philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. For most people, philosophy can seem far from reality. If philosophers used to challenge this idea, many don't anymore. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy have become more focused on specific, technical debates, explaining them to people outside the field is hard, and even harder for those without training. Philosophy, in some cases, has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about evaluating human actions. But recently, I feel this title doesn't fully describe my work because ethics is often seen as related to rules and laws. This is a new development in philosophy: ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today try to decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often think about them. But philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is wrong (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people look more closely at their actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find out things we already know; other times, we realize our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, by examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,"People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, philosophers have often used food as a way to talk about other topics, like learning. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related ideas. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus talked about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is now often linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants and food-related businesses, likely because they think it will attract customers if their products are associated with famous philosophers.

Food is a social and cultural experience. It comes from historical backgrounds and is shared with people in our communities. These communities provide us with people to eat with and the systems to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than any other product, making it an interesting topic for philosophical study.

Once food is made, critics start discussing and writing about it. But why do they have such an important role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, food critics are just better at describing tastes. This area has not been studied much because philosophers have focused more on vision than taste. This should change.

Another part of food is its beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. However, food is eaten and disappears, unlike art or music, which last over time. So, some think food cannot be considered a true art form.

There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often show our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of personal relationships. At home, everyone shares food and friendship. Professional cooks have duties to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are only for qualified people, and their relationships are professional.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by enjoying food from other cultures and by eating together, which has a long history in international diplomacy. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories, making the topic of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a storyline or if decisions made in one game could affect the next. He changed a classic board game called Risk to make a new version: Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have a lasting effect. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules at key moments. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and long-term rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’ 

Daviau was then asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very successful, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was not based on an earlier game. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said: ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.’

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a small interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is different and pretty good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks a lot of rules. I thought only a few people would like it.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it’s a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and you get that with legacy games.’ Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the adventure was more important than worries about the game’s lifespan. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and ruining the board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It adds a story like in video games.’

The legacy format is influenced by video games and the demand for episodic entertainment from TV series. Daviau once wanted to be a TV writer but moved to advertising and then game design. He still loves telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start,’ he said. ‘But you also need more than just an outline.’ While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is interested in seeing how others develop the idea. But he also thinks people might soon ask: ‘What’s next?’ Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, believes the legacy format is groundbreaking. ‘It changes how you think about what a board game can be,’ he said."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children's movie, was shared widely online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to imagine animals behaving like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very intelligent but look very different from us. Octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

Some people think that giving animals human-like traits is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes the opposite. He argues that ignoring the human-like traits of animals, which he calls ""anthropodenial,"" is more common. By studying animal behavior, he shows that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.

In the past, people believed animals had complex minds. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said that the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind.

In the 20th century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines that responded to stimuli or as robots with instincts. People who thought animals had inner lives were considered unscientific. This view coincided with humans destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.

Fortunately, de Waal believes we are now recognizing animal intelligence more. He says that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the specific traits and skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts. In her book ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might think we are not very smart because we can't change our skin color like they can.

De Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape story. He thinks it's unlikely that Inky knew how to find a drain leading to the ocean. However, he acknowledges that viral stories can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers were upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video clip of the experiment convinced more people of the findings. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways."
17,"Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to the impact of industrialisation. Robots have been used in car and manufacturing industries for many years, but experts say we are close to a big change where robots will be used in many more areas. However, many people are not ready for this change. Most people think robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, but they also believe their own jobs will still exist. This is not true, as robotic automation will affect every industry soon. 

For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that would take two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a startup called Simbe Robotics has introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check if products are stocked and priced correctly.

Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot yet service or program themselves, which means new jobs will be created for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. Critics, however, worry that we are not ready for the loss of human interaction in jobs. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will create laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but there will still be a lack of skilled workers.

Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be affected by automation and need to retrain themselves, as they cannot rely on the government to protect their jobs. New developments in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, like robots that live with us at home and interact with us in advanced ways. This presents a big opportunity for companies but also challenges, such as creating new rules to keep us safe. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it's there."" This response reflects a common curiosity: why do people risk their lives for something that seems pointless? Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams and face the unknown. It suggests that climbing might be about adventure and fun. 

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He believed that the way you climb, like using more or less equipment, should follow the rules of the specific climbing activity. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in Western climbing culture, influencing everything from magazines to discussions around campfires.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also be very limiting, like when you're stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. But some argue that the simplicity of climbing, with its limited choices, is a form of freedom itself.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective. He suggests asking ""Why do people climb?"" instead of just ""Why climb?"" Fitschen believes that climbing is part of our nature as humans. It's in our genes to take on challenges and push our limits, even if it's risky. So, the joy of climbing might be more about our biology than logical reasons.

US academic Brian Treanor adds another view. He thinks climbing helps develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing, then, can help us develop qualities that are useful in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who don't rely on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson argued that climbing achievements done independently deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or artificial aids, like bottled oxygen. This view sparked some controversy, as it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Finally, some people look at climbing from a non-Western perspective. Climbers often talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, the meditative state during a climb, and intuitive problem-solving are key parts of climbing. These aspects are similar to Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This connection offers another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known as an intellectual and sometimes serious person who focused on European piano music. He wrote and performed a lot but rarely taught. People close to him saw a fun side, but he didn't show it much in concerts. His life was a constant cycle of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel didn't take it seriously because he had taught very few students and didn't plan to start. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, ""You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk."" But something about Kit, who was about 14 then, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played beautifully from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital he had done. Brendel thought, ""I have to make time for him."" Kit's performance was rare because he had a great understanding of the music and played with subtlety.

As Brendel steps back from public life, Kit is starting to become known, but Brendel is careful to prevent him from burning out. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under his mother's watchful eye. He also composes music. Brendel says this is important because writing music helps you read it better. Kit has an amazing memory and can read music at first sight. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and understands Brendel's advice. When Brendel suggests something, Kit applies it throughout the piece.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, as it can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit plays some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

Now at 80, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He says, ""When I was young, I didn't want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them, but there was still room for more, so I continued. Although I don't have the physical strength now, my mind is always active with pieces I've never played. I don't perform anymore, but it's a nice new phase in my life."""
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad's garden wasn't in a dirty city. It was by a river and gently sloped down to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places of peace and quiet. Grandad's garden wasn't special in terms of features. He didn't have a greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass was broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He wasn't without humor, though. He liked to say things like, ""It's immaterial to me,"" instead of just saying, ""I don't mind."" He probably felt disappointed that he hadn't achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn't passionate about. He wasn't very ambitious, although he and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn't happen. He was very skilled at home repairs, like building bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother liked to change the furniture often. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I wasn't given the chance, she said, ""You'd never have practiced.""

Of the three places – moors, woods, or river – I usually chose the river. I would go there with a fishing net and sandals that were too small, with the fronts cut out for my toes. I’d find a spot to leave my sandals and picnic, then look for fish to catch with my net. After trying to keep them alive at home, I would release them back into the water.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father said, ""There's an apprentice gardener job in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested."" In that moment, my dad went against his usual thinking. He might have preferred me to be a carpenter, but I like to think he believed things might work out well if I stuck with gardening. Maybe I'm fooling myself, but I prefer to believe that deep down, even though he didn't like gardening, he saw my passion for it and hoped for the best."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I do the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the steep cliff and into the ocean 120 meters below. MacEwen's sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and MacEwen gently pets him. Despite the howling wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. He is showing me around. Pointing to the north, he shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds pouring rain on Rum's large mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep as rain approaches. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Muck is volcanic, three kilometers long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep interrupts our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to herd the sheep but not doing well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen calls, meaning the dog should go to the right. Instead, Tie goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, sounding disappointed. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, takes care of the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They leave the house and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. I get used to it, along with having no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone away.’ So I do the same. Everything on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians with their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their feet to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay after seeing it in a newspaper, without even visiting. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know anything about farming? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the small island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it tastes amazing. Also amazing is my ferry ride the next morning to another island. In the past two months, many ferries were canceled due to high seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, with or without a phone, is something I secretly hoped for."
22,"The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and self-taught people, and there weren't many ways to get into it. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now the video games industry is taken seriously. This doesn't surprise industry experts. Making video games, especially those based on movies, is not easy. It requires many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it's hard to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says it's tough to make progress in big companies or influence major games. However, the industry needs more game designers, not just directors but also those who design systems and parts of games.

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a computer science degree, but Jim disagrees. He says the only way is to make games. The tools are available, and you need to create something to get a job. Game design is more a lifestyle than a job. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real.

Another expert, John Field, agrees that just doing it is important, but it's more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense needed. Can you succeed on your own? John says it's possible but difficult. A good postgraduate course in games can help by providing support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and arts. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in the field. Networking is also important to succeed in games, as in many other areas.

The old stereotype of a teenage boy playing video games has changed. Now, games are seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. Games are becoming popular with larger audiences and are a great way to learn. He sees this as an area with many possibilities and opportunities."
23,"Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me, but he didn't force me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It's only by practicing that you can score impressive goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I try to show them how to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope that his habit of kicking them around doesn't mean he's like me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so young players like me could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never told us, 'This is your big chance,' but we knew it was. Even though I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely a lot on close friends and family. Having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. People sometimes say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' Of course, I've helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would be offended if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I enjoy using my money to make life easier for those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I want to take a year off, maybe longer, to do things I haven't been able to do. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father couldn't write anything sellable while we lived in Los Angeles, which was bad for Sam's business. So, Sam found us a cheap place to live. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point wasn't popular with day-trippers. The road was not appealing, and the nearby resort, La Carmella, was more attractive for those with some money. Only people who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, the place filled with people. After months of being alone, we were now surrounded by activity. My father was busy trying to meet a writing deadline and was in a bad mood. I spent most days on the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We didn't have a dog when we moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to adopt us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. I gave him water one day, and my father half-heartedly tried to scare him off. Rusty stayed. My father said, ""He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found, like a new sneaker or a beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. We had been swimming that day. My father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon together. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. One surfer stood out with her amazing style. She finished for the day and came over to talk to me. She asked why I didn't join them, and I said I didn't have a surfboard or money. She guessed I was British and asked if I was visiting. I told her I lived there and that my father was writing a film script. She asked if she knew him, and I said his name was Rufus Marsh. She recognized the name from his novel, ""Tall as the Morning,"" and suddenly seemed more interested in me. This was typical; people were friendly but only really interested when I mentioned my father's book."
25,"Violet Hetherington was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline cruise ship. Her friend Annie had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this turned out to be bad advice. An announcement over the loudspeakers said there was a problem with the computer system, which made the passengers frustrated. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service.

Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. This was more annoying than the long wait because all her important phone numbers were stored in it. She borrowed a phone from a friendly couple behind her in line to call her son Harry. She left him a message to ask their neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at her flat. Without her phone, she would have trouble finding numbers she needed in New York.

Harry often thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding but forgetful. Violet worried he might not pass on the message to Kristina.

Finally, the line started moving, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. She was disappointed by the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. The elevators were crowded with tired passengers, and Violet felt uncomfortable seeing her reflection in the mirrors.

When she reached the twelfth floor, she was relieved to find her room had the balcony she had requested. She had paid extra to ensure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he didn't know he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for pictures for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing interesting scenes. Since then, Maloof has collected a large archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked at all of it and realized he had found something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ For a while now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They talked to families who hired her as a nanny and employees at the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be private and a bit unusual, always carrying a camera. She wore oversized coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘On her day off, she would leave with her camera in the morning and return late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Although she wasn’t very social, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed very dedicated to her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was for commercial reasons. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her style on her own. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this, or did she take ideas from others?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. The funny thing is he wasn’t really interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I became a better photographer and looked at her work again, I realized the cityscapes weren’t what mattered to her. It was the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I had something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But that's not the case with Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when the book was very popular, and she was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who then asked, ""What's it about?"" This is a tough question for any author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have happened, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found that the past gave her more chances for her characters to face complications and misunderstandings. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said it feels nice because everyone in her small country feels part of her success. She added that it bothers her when people think her book isn't a serious work. Catton wanted to write the book in a spiral shape, with each part half the length of the one before. It speeds up as it goes. I asked if it matters if readers notice this. She said she wanted to create a book with patterns that didn't matter, but if readers cared, they could find them. Despite its experimental structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she didn't plan the story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then find creative ways out. She also wanted the book to be fun for readers. We talked about her love for TV drama series, which use cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she might want to write for TV. She said, ""That could be pretty cool,"" with enthusiasm and a laugh. She gets excited when talking about her work and New Zealand. She notices how her imagination changes when she visits Britain. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busy places to be around more people. But for now, New Zealand will stay her home. Many hope it continues to inspire her future novels."
28,"When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he loved making things in his dad's garage and playing the guitar. These two hobbies became his career for the last forty years: he builds steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny is still amazed by how two pieces of wood can create beautiful sounds and how different types of wood make different sounds. He learned to play his brother's guitar at eleven and wanted to learn the bass guitar at sixteen. Instead of buying one, he decided to make it himself. He studied guitars to understand how their shapes and wood types affected the sound.

Jonny's first instrument was a bass guitar, but he and his brothers had been building model boats and airplanes for a long time. His father taught them how to use tools like saws and chisels. Jonny also repaired instruments for his friends. Although his bass guitar was successful, he didn't think about making guitars as a career. He was also interested in painting and sculpture. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university because it involved design, which he liked. However, he left the course halfway through because he realized he was too independent for it. He discovered that building guitars is like sculpture because it involves shaping sound. He thought it was more practical than pure art because people use guitars.

Since then, Jonny has been making guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time to earn money. At first, he sold his guitars for just the cost of the materials, but as he became known as a great guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, he says he is ""still scratching a living"" because he can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to get noticed by going to music festivals and getting musicians to try his guitars. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which was difficult for him.

Jonny thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, people believed the best acoustic guitars were made in the USA, even though the UK had good instrument-making courses and skills. Now, UK-made guitars have a good reputation. Jonny believes that while valuable techniques can be learned in classes, there is no substitute for trial and error. He advises looking at other instruments to see what works and trying different things. If you make mistakes, like making the back of the guitar too thin or too thick, it won't sound good. He says that if you learn from someone else, you only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like he did, you learn everything."
29,"When talking about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a tradition, and many writers mention Dr. Johnson's famous comment from the 18th century: ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. However, many people try to explain why English people talk so much about the weather and often fail. They mistakenly think that English people are really interested in the weather itself. For example, American writer Bill Bryson says the English weather is not exciting, so he finds the obsession with it hard to understand. He notes that England doesn't have extreme weather like tornadoes or monsoons. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you never know what weather to expect.

My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the real point. English people don't talk about the weather because they care about it. Instead, weather talk is a way for English people to start conversations and connect with each other. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not really about the weather. They are greetings or ways to start a conversation. This is similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially.

There are specific times when English people use weather talk. It can be a greeting, a way to start a conversation, or a topic to fill awkward silences. This means English people do talk about the weather a lot, which can make it seem like they are obsessed with it. An English conversation might start with weather talk, use it to break the ice, and return to it when there is nothing else to say. This is why people from other countries, and even some English people, think that English people are very interested in the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were already interested because they chose this trip over more glamorous ones to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. When she couldn't find a historical novel to help explain life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. She felt it was a big change from teaching, which she compared to acting because it requires a lot of energy. Writing, on the other hand, is exciting but not as tiring. Her former colleagues are a bit jealous because she still connects with children through her books. Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children's fiction today. She notes that many books for teenagers focus on negative experiences or are complete fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are different. Alice always tried to teach English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy, and she loves seeing children go from being bored to interested. She sees her writing as an extension of teaching. She was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher also suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. She didn't want to spend her summer on a course she thought unnecessary, but she had to send in a piece of fiction to be accepted. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby, and was accepted into the course. Her classmates liked her story and suggested she publish it. With only school report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, who is a critic and editor, helped her a lot with editing. Alice says they complement each other well. He helps improve her writing by suggesting changes, while she likes to add more scenes. This shows the difference between a fiction writer and an editor."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to a special race. The race would be between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

Jonny was excited about the race as he stood at the start line. He said, ""I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold at the moment, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm."" Alistair was also eager to start, but unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, Alistair was dressed in full winter cycling gear. He joked, ""I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race began at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to end at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, which is about 350 meters up. This was not a problem for the car, but Alistair had a tough start with a steep 25 percent incline. After a quick handshake, the race began. Alistair sped off on his bike, heading straight up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss, while Jonny got into the car and started driving. The next time they would see each other would be at the finish line. The big question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s confidence was quickly tested. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first obstacle: a giant tractor came out of a field and blocked the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he joked to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!"" After a tense moment, Jonny got past the tractor and continued driving into the morning mist.

Meanwhile, Alistair was struggling with the steep hill. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched him curiously as he kept a steady pace, carrying his bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side, the ground was open, and with the sun coming out, he had a chance to show his skills. He put his head down, feet on the pedals, and started picking up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another local challenge. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have been around since before cars were invented, and the roads are not made for speed. Jonny had to carefully drive through narrow corners and a stream on the road. Once he was clear of the last village, he raced straight to the finish line.

Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. He pushed hard, and then there was a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. Alistair looked up and asked the waiting crowd, ""Is he here?"" When they said no, he celebrated with his arms up. Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car and stepped out. ""Well done,"" Jonny said, feeling disappointed. ""I’m gutted."""
32,"Playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a unique experience because of the silence. When you play, you can hear the sound of the ball on the soft grass and the echo of each shot. The well-kept grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds make you feel separated from the outside world. This quiet helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to concentrate only on the game and the point I am playing. The silence is only broken by the noise of applause and cheers when a point is won. Even though there are fifteen thousand people watching, I feel like they are far away. I am so focused that I forget millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life.

I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach all my life, taught me that this is the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I was telling my friends that I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost twice against Federer, including in the final the year before. Losing in 2006 was not too hard because I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty years old. Federer beat me easily because I didn’t believe in myself enough. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have done better, and it was my mindset, not my skills, that let me down. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing is always painful, but it is worse when you know you had a chance to win. Toni, who is a very tough coach, usually criticizes me even when I win. But after that loss, he tried to comfort me, saying there would be more chances to win Wimbledon. I told him he didn’t understand, and I thought it was my last chance. I know a professional athlete’s career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I felt I missed a big one in 2007. Toni couldn’t make me feel better, but he was right in the end. I got another chance in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I had learned from my defeat and that my mindset would be strong this time. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends, and we didn’t talk about the match. They knew I was already thinking about the game in my mind, and I needed that space to be mine alone until the match started."
33,"In April 1957, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. She wrote home saying she was living in the Africa she had always dreamed of. Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made her famous with articles and TV shows about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including children's books and the bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes hides her real achievements. Many stories about her life focus on her adventurous spirit and dreams of living with wild animals, but these stories can overlook her true contributions. Based on her research, the success of her students, and the data she collected over 40 years, Jane Goodall should be seen as a leading pioneer in her field and a top zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.

Before Goodall's work, people misunderstood chimpanzees. They didn't know chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. They also didn't realize chimpanzees have emotions and social systems similar to humans. Goodall's book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her study in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements by biologist Stephen Jay Gould. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. At five years old, she disappeared one day, causing a search by police and neighbors. She reappeared with straw in her hair, explaining she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity foreshadowed her future as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using different voices: a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to say many medical terms.’ Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it. You have to make the script come alive for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get the parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a regular acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a major part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and lots of paperwork, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes everything from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that specialize in helping voiceover artists create them.’ She claims to have reached the top of her profession through persistence as much as natural talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or simply practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is important, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a dream job for many kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more practical careers, like becoming a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems silly. But some people do it. 

People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. In my case, I loved comic strips as a child, contributed to school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are basic, but the job is still tough. You shouldn't try to become a cartoonist unless you feel you can't do anything else. It's easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don't turn down any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don't really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are mostly over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create and sell your work. Cartoonists with average talent but good business skills often do better than artistic geniuses who lack those skills.

It's surprising how many people are afraid someone will steal their ideas, even if they've never sold a cartoon. Some are so worried they won't show their work to anyone. Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small 'c' for 'copyright,' put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of those things was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to get rid of it? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man came up to me, looking confused. He asked, ""You're not just going to throw that away, are you?"" I said I was, but I already felt a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways, but I felt sad about it for years.

Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish at a restaurant. The email was from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He said, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so emotional. I would have paid anything, but his price was fair. I had forgotten my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this story!

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s when it was popular. I loved its calming sound, but I didn’t make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn’t need to play well to be a rock star. When I got my guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I felt the need to stand up and play it with a strap over my shoulder. My fingers remembered the chords, even though I couldn’t draw them. My fingertips felt the pain of pressing the strings. The electric guitar isn’t really for playing alone, so I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I’ll find others my age with similar stories. We could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who can't sleep well, I felt like I was the only one talking about how dangerous it is to not get enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them in these discussions. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, missing the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, the stage with the most dreams. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years dreaming. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests that dreams are important. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who thought that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. But later research didn't support this idea, and the study of dreams shifted to their physical origins. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams matter. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He concluded that using dreams increases with interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Doesn't everyone, like teachers, software designers, and politicians, need to think creatively? Dreams, according to Stickgold, help us connect things in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new ideas. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ignore the obvious and make unexpected connections, which is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come so quickly that I can hardly keep up. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and we all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. In her studio, which has a beautiful sea view, you see empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading artist in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate the richness of early-20th century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Surprisingly, she doesn't keep any of her own work. 'As soon as I finish them, they go,' she says. Susie is in high demand. Over her 30-year career as a copyist artist, she has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that even art experts can mistake them for the originals. While the originals sell for millions, her copies sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie doesn't usually reveal her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but for others, status is important. One celebrity likes to show off his 'Van Gogh' painting, which is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh.' 'Many famous people pretend my copies are originals,' she says. 'That's their choice.' Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank and displaying Susie's copy. Susie is honest about her work. She makes her reproductions look as authentic as possible because she believes doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as an original is illegal, and although she knows people who have done it, she has never been tempted. People who make fakes often get into trouble. Susie isn't rich and has had tough times, but her situation is more stable now, and risking her reputation doesn't make sense. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. It was good training for her current work and gave her a love for plants, but it was hard to live on. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets but is glad she found something more financially rewarding. When young artists ask for advice, Susie tells them to learn to draw accurately. She also emphasizes the importance of studying to do what she does. Her skills allow her to do anything from drawing plants to copying 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art. She now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie says people often think modern art is easy, almost like child's play. Impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very detailed, which is hard to achieve. Given her talent, it's surprising Susie doesn't create her own original art. Isn't art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She says her work is the result of years of training and practice, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—good, but not special. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was passionate about the sea and being the fastest sailor. From a young age, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a special connection with the boats she sailed around the world. On land, she found everyday life unimportant and was eager to return to the ocean, even though it was dangerous. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher, where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even the number of kitchen paper rolls she needed. Preparation was crucial for her. She proudly showed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and medical necessities. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, an island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her realize how humans take resources and move on. When I visited her office, she explained why we must act now to save the planet. She said, ""No one is making coal, oil, or gas anymore. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find a way not to use them up."" Initially, her message was to use less, but she now focuses on re-using, like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, Ellen has visited factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. She admits she's not an expert but loves learning. She feels that sailing now seems selfish compared to her new mission, which is about using her voice to make a difference. She started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to create a sustainable future. Ellen misses the adventure of being at sea, where she felt connected and focused on survival. However, she believes her new mission is more important than anything she has done before."
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous among teenagers. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to encourage them to go outside and try new challenges. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

I talked to some experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agreed that a young climber might be physically strong enough, but they were unsure if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also doubted that a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, ‘I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that – we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow stronger gives me confidence.’

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father loves adventure? Paul says, ‘This isn't about me wanting fame through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later, but we decided, why not now? We always check with him to make sure he still wants to do it.’ When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ‘I just focus on reaching my goal.’

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record attempt. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This creates a challenge for Jordan. People might say that focusing on records takes away from the fun, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to be in the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, ‘If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we'll stop this project and go to the gym.’"
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they aren't listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but even my classmates don't know much about classical music. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't own their music. This is sad for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. Why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who love classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big classical music fan. I like many music styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure. So why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk, play, and think fast. Experts say we can't focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more interesting to us than long classical pieces without lyrics. Classical music is powerful but doesn't deal with issues that matter to teenagers. How we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people are going to classical concerts now, but I doubt many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why people like classical concerts more as they get older, but I know that if your parents love something, teenagers often avoid it. Some say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They like classical music when they perform, but it's not their first choice when they relax. They separate the two activities. When we want to relax, we choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you regret I came here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too, but she didn’t hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t mind if her mother heard because she already knew how Bonnie felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among trees on a hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be kicked out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not start now?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""You’re the best one here!"" she said. He was brown with some white. He seemed lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They must be nearby."" The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, which made Bonnie happy. She was so focused on putting a saddle on Maverick that she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m serious because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The movement was exciting, and the breeze made her cheeks glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by how calmly confident he is. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia who has already released many successful songs. So, how did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" But back then, he was more focused on swimming and surfing. He was 13, attending high school, and then he posted a few videos online. These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos. So, Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The response was huge. Cody was also a talented swimmer, training with top coaches and focusing on his sport. But then record labels showed interest, and he had a tough decision: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a big risk by signing a music deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career,"" he says. ""Can you imagine, at 12 or 13, trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked reactions. ""I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family to the US, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody says it’s important to have a close group of great people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, everyone has days of doubt. ""Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight, traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about that sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they’re here to support and encourage me."" Success, in any career, comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to your big opportunity, even when it’s a bit scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be visiting countries I never thought I’d see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbag wall, which was there to stop the buildings from flooding when the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags. Last week, I worked with most of the town's adults for long hours to show I could do it. But my grandfather didn't seem to notice. With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the wood factory in Milltown. There was fragile ice on both sides, and solid ice downstream. As I changed out of my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn't know him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It's better than having a famous grandfather because only he, my mom, and I know about it. Plus, I have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I patted the chain and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex,’ Mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ My wetsuit should have made that clear. He sees me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it's getting harder. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom gave me a sympathetic smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say he’s always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a kid, he was my hero, especially when he showed me his photos in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I hurried to the boathouse in the backyard."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unfinished painting by Grandpa. It was different from his usual work. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. It showed a river, but not one she recognized. It might not even be a real river, just an imaginary one. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green. The eye was drawn to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, Jess was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, hiding her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. Maybe he'll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. If artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" Jess knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint. He'd say the muse wasn't being kind to him or that he needed to be nice to the muse for a difficult part. He never suggested the muse was her. She thought he meant a goddess, not a person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I will cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm unlucky that way.

What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's very cute, small, painted white with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her cabinet, so I was excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it needs to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But since Angela is only fifteen, I'll be in my small room for a while. I don't mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... Then I had an idea. If I couldn't cut the cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' point of view, not the humans', which made filming more complicated. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when filming them, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. To show the Borrowers' view of the human world, the crew had to film from no higher than 15 centimeters off the ground, which wore out a lot of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. A big challenge was making the shadows look right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US director George Lucas called to ask how we did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry giant things like scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh. In the story, there's a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary they didn't have to act. Getting the costumes right was important to me, and other directors have struggled with this in other versions. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn't sit during breaks and had to be sewn into the dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, it was really hot during filming, and I don't think they thanked me for the detailed costumes! Most scenes away from the Borrowers' home were filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how they should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren't accurate, but they worked. The budget didn't allow for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists, but there are none. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people pretending to be friends, and the requests for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. ""Everything’s going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we’re staying permanently. I chose this school because I want to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal. 

I walk into the school’s main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the school secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad uses his stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it’s printing,"" she says. She hands me the schedule. English Literature is my first class. Great, I like English. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t look lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already calling roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! No one will suspect anything now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read, she gives us time to talk! All teachers should do this. ""So why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many options. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But I’ll pretend to be normal until then. ""He’s an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way."" And she doesn’t seem to care. Perfect."
49,"The average American teenage girl today is expected to do many things. She should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what being a teenager in America is like now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and be average. Being average is not enough anymore. If you don't have big goals, people might think you are lazy. 

Teenager Kristen Loose says, ""People, especially adults, forget how much pressure teenagers have these days. We have lots of homework, tests, activities outside of school, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. Plus, we try to have a social life."" Even though these pressures are normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes about them still exist. The media often shows teenagers as lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might be like this, it's not fair to say all teenagers are the same.

Loose says, ""Many people think we spend most of our time watching TV or on our phones."" She believes this is not true. She admits she keeps her phone close most of the time, but not just for fun. It's a tool that helps teenagers and their families. People expect students to have access to the world and be reachable all the time, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their work anywhere. They might listen to language lessons instead of music on the way to school. Schoolwork and activities now need attention all the time, adding to teenagers' busy lives.

Many teenagers start their day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. Then, they have to do it all again the next day, often with less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20% of teens get nine hours of sleep a night. Also, 28% of teens said they fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are so tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time a week after all her activities. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen doesn't waste this time on social media or TV. She spends a lot of it volunteering. ""People think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests,"" Olsen says. But she loves volunteering and making a positive impact in her school and community. 

In 20 years, we don't know what people will think about teenagers, but they will likely still be proving stereotypes wrong and making the world better. There will be a new generation of students who are making big changes, even before they finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the past few years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a science project with a twist: it's part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check temperature changes. Two GPS trackers were on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, was used to inflate the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy had driven seven hours to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For kids in this club, that's normal. Finally, it was time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chanted, and the balloon started to rise. Some of them ran and tracked its path with powerful flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was a quiet sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky, hard to believe it was just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I watched a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor shot across the sky. As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, and the balloon expanded until it was almost the size of a house. Then it burst in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helped the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day, using the GPS trackers. Getting it back wasn’t easy, but that was part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box almost always lands in the middle of nowhere. ‘To me, recoveries are a huge part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who noted they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey has been becoming more familiar with this landscape in a way you never normally would.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to get it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. Then they had to decide whether to drive or walk – it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘It's important to remember that these students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What may seem wild and dangerous to some is just a way of life to others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it was a bit disappointing, but it was also a chance to discuss the effects of atmospheric waves and how they might work above mountain ridges. And it was one more adventure story to share with others."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she wasn't interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. Her interest started by accident. Her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a common phase for kids, which she hadn't gone through. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. This article amazed her, and she realized she wanted to pursue this field. 

I asked her about the support she received because Palaeontology wasn't a typical career choice for young people then. She remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. She was nervous at first, worried he might find her annoying with her questions. However, he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

I mentioned how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe thinks films like Jurassic Park have increased interest in dinosaurs but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She feels that palaeontologists in movies are often shown as either eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks, which isn't accurate. She explains that her job is varied, involving digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs, analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. She also believes in communicating scientific findings to the public, especially to young people, to clear up misunderstandings about science and inspire them.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, which aimed to show dinosaurs accurately. She says the program makers knew what they were doing, and she only needed to give advice occasionally. The dinosaurs in the show were very realistic, different from those in movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes dinosaurs fascinate us because they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. They remind us that there is still much to learn about the world, and Palaeontology allows us to explore the past."
52,"I'm going to say this once: when you're traveling by car with your family, even if you're six years old, you probably know you're not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" And when you do arrive, it's not ""there"" anymore; it's ""here."" So, if you think you might be ""there,"" you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" I'm sure no one wants to be ""there"" more than the parents who hear that question over and over during long car trips. 

Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, mom or dad is there to give out juice boxes and cookies, change the radio station, and keep everything running smoothly. 

Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying—like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. I put my foot on his side, and soon we're fighting. The driver and co-pilot separate us, telling Tim to stay in his seat. This calms things down for a while, and the scenery continues to pass by. 

Later, I'm trying to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. But the window isn't open. It's Tim, blowing air on me from his side. He's not touching me, so technically he's not doing anything wrong. But it makes me angry. Tim gets yelled at, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again—for now. 

Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he often says, ""Yes, we're here. Get out of the car."" ""But Dad, we're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour."" ""Oh, then maybe we're not there yet."" That keeps us quiet for a while. 

You know you're finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move far away from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is no, you're not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a space where people can connect without using technology. She says, ""Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together in a way that doesn't involve screens. It's natural for people to be together and communicate.""

The games played in their café are called 'Eurogames.' These games have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone involved until the end. This idea was improved in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. 

One popular Eurogame is Pandemic, created by North American designer Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He remembers playing it with friends and feeling scared but excited. He wanted to create a game that made everyone feel good, whether they won or lost. 

Leacock loved board games since he was a child, even though he often felt disappointed by them. With help from his uncle, he started designing better games. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up version included more storytelling. Leacock explains that it is like an electronic game where you develop characters and the world changes, creating an unfolding story.

Interestingly, the growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games. Video games have made playing games more normal. Ben Hogg, who works for a games company, says, ""Everyone with a smartphone has at least one game they like to play."" 

In the past, video games allowed people to play together in the same room. But now, many video games are played online, where players are not physically together. This has led some people to look for games they can play with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, these games offer a way to connect with others in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced many big UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many false starts. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. Growing up, he only listened to a local radio station for middle-aged people, which influenced his music taste. He heard a modern song for the first time when he was 12. Around that age, he had to choose between playing tennis at a national level and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. Although he was good at tennis, he realized it wasn't what he wanted to do for the rest of his life because it was too much hard work. At 17, he left school to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to pursue music, explaining that he wrote lyrics during economics lessons and played the piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he signed with a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend. Jamie eventually found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he switched to another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune didn't come. He felt he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time as an artist, but as a writer, he was in the right place. Writing for others became his strength. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK, helping new artists start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that aiming for the charts is not a bad thing. He asks them why they wouldn't want millions of people to listen to their music. He believes in writing songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well. Jamie is honest about wanting to write number-one hits, without arrogance. He knows he has a talent for it and focuses on writing the best music. When he works with someone in the studio, his goal is to create music that is globally successful and to write classic modern pop songs."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online but might be unknown to people who don't watch videos of bike stunts. He is a 'street trials cyclist,' which means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. 

When I met him at a BMX park, many local boys and even older people recognized him and called him a 'legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, he explained what he planned to do, and I often doubted he could do it. But he always succeeded. When I praised him, he seemed not very interested. Despite his online fame, Tony doesn't like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to interact socially and prefers doing things rather than talking about them. 

This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. He admits that this technology helps him make a living, but he feels that people focus too much on screens. However, he is not complaining because he earns well from his videos, which would have been just a hobby in the past.

From my experience with top athletes, I know that two things are important to become a top competitor: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. These are more important than talent and help someone keep going despite failures. In risky sports, mental strength is crucial. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times but got up and tried again until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he takes unnecessary risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport and don't know that he gets expert advice to minimize risks. He is careful about the risks he takes. He believes it's important to be aware of dangers. He divides people into those who can't overcome fear and those who can. He feels fear but finds a way to get past it. He is not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning. He needs to be in the right mindset before trying a new stunt and knows he must stay calm before jumping. If he fully commits, he is fine."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. Her latest challenge was walking on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found high-wire walking very different. ""The training was a shock,"" Helen said. ""I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, then an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could continue if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she said afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, using a kite, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to travel to Amsterdam for a holiday. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally started his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Even though I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further I traveled from home, the more amazed people were by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got a serious fever and was stuck in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for hospital bills or to get back home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night, because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about how to protect their habitat. The work is tough. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some areas and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but often it is wet. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – many hours in a lab, where we will look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from the company I work for. Every week, I get samples from our factory. These are small amounts of chocolate that I check for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I also give samples to my colleagues, which makes them happy! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. Every day is different in this job. Sometimes I'm at our food lab, and other times I'm traveling to buy raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety and the fact that there is no routine, although I think the best part is still the chocolate! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!'"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. During the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, ""For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time. It's important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important—circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or only work a short time each year. But the real issue is planning for the future because you can only perform while you're young, and then you need to think about other options."" The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, that it's not a job for making a lot of money! ""The work usually means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive—but a lot of fun!"""
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you've probably heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers, but that's not true. They often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! 

""What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job!""

""Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There's often no sheet music to look at. I'll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always know which musical range is best for the female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it."""
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion. She created a successful company selling 'satchels,' which are traditional school bags. These bags are now sold in famous stores and are popular with celebrities. Before choosing to make satchels, Julie considered different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She didn't just go with her first idea. When she decided on satchels, not everyone agreed with her choice. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children's storybooks. Although Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they played a big role in her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To get more attention, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew, as did the speed of production. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is photographed with a satchel. While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices, where people love to work. There is now a new factory, and while the building is important, it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky thought it looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, at 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a larger group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people aren’t sure if having celebrities is always good for a charity. They think celebrities only do it to promote themselves, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Ana Ronson, a singer-songwriter, grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. Ana first sang in front of an audience at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to gain confidence. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days and enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional. Even though she was the youngest, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher didn't listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her frustration. She posted it online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled across Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn't know the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. But Joss convinced her this wouldn't happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a fantastic evening. Ana prefers writing songs about difficult times because she feels there's more to express. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes fans like her songs, her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to visit. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about what needed to be done. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people lived along that coast. On the first morning, the only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. There were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop worrying about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it really felt like stress-free living!

When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss my family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many games would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I agreed to play against another school. My parents came to watch, which made me nervous, but it turned out fine in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't enjoy being far from my parents at first. At home, I didn't have much time with friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that to get a license as a full-time tour guide, I needed to know a lot more than I already did. In Chicago, guides must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. You also need to be entertaining, tell interesting stories, and handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour without hearing about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might leave a negative review online. Good reviews are important because they attract more customers. That's why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy usually lead to very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. However, we didn't need to worry. 

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard, but seeing the elephants enjoy their food made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants! 

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. We would lead the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space, but that was our choice because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn’t include meat, which we both prefer. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff would talk and play games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I definitely will!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers not only to people who want them for friends or their homes but also to different kinds of customers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo sessions. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping at that time, and my friends think I’m crazy, but I love what I do. It’s often colder and darker than I’d like, but that’s normal for early morning, so I don’t mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I’d probably only pick pink flowers because it’s my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what customers want can be different. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can’t find what customers want.

I don’t enjoy arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers aren’t cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we make flower arrangements and calculate the cost of orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things, and I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest movies I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It's close to where I live. However, a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to talk about a movie in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we pick a different place in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a movie set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the perfect atmosphere for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which helps us keep our prices low. We’re happy just to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say they had a great experience, it’s wonderful. The website has been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve visited to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing is as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed."
71,"When I was a child, taking photographs was my favorite thing to do. At 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I decided to do something special. I started a personal project: to take one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was surprised to find that people liked how I saw and photographed things. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then, someone suggested that my project would be better if all my photos had a common theme. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing, as they mostly took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost quit several times. But in the end, I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize. I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough for me to work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I’ve never regretted my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were all new experiences for me. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and they are run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week as my first challenge. I wasn’t sure about it because I had joined that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. After I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me continue volunteering at the club because I had made great relationships with the children. Now, I volunteer there for about four hours a week and I really look forward to it.

Because of my experience at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about this before joining the club. In fact, I hadn’t thought much about my future job at all. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly grew to love the sport and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for competing and winning has grown stronger as I’ve gotten older. This helps me push myself harder. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes it works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That success made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying because there’s no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. It helps me cope with not being able to do what I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering becoming a doctor if I can find time for college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I didn't think about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I'm grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I found it easier than I thought, even though it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery pieces to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. I wanted to know if other people would like them too, so I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists visit my town, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many workers, but it was just my mum and me at the market stall! That's when I realized it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, but we still have our market stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, ""Because of my dad's job, my family moved around a lot, so I got good at making new friends. I know what it's like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, starting at a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I'm an only child, I had to use my imagination for that part."" Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she won first prize in a short story competition on a young writers’ website. Because of this, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters in the story face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer also says that even though Janine is young and her novel isn't very long, she is a better writer than some other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me on the street, but now it's OK. I’d like to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, spending time with my friends gives me ideas to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! It all began when my father was asked to be the castle's manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was happy because he thought he might not get such a great opportunity again, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were mainly thinking about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very lively in summer because it attracts lots of visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island, which often involves a lot of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day back to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days when there are huge waves – but the ferries don't run then! And I've found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I'm always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, though, it's so foggy that you can't see anything, then within hours, it's bright sunshine again – it still seems incredible when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it's been here for centuries – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after we came back home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m almost there. During family holidays abroad, I have had the chance to see birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a pretty good player. However, my family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. And the chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13. After that, I got much better. Even so, people still doubted I’d become a star player, which made me a bit upset. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me if we lost. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, the team carried me around the field. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"In recent years, both in the UK and internationally, there has been a trend in further and higher education to involve students in research early in their studies. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries, but it is also a basic way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your job because they help you think about the world and do your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if this were different? These questions are the basis of research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex and groundbreaking research done by highly trained people, leading to big changes and new knowledge. On the other end, research can be everyday inquiries that involve careful work and asking thoughtful questions about issues and practices. Most students have done some research before, like for school projects or at work. You have been asking questions and doing investigations since you first became interested in studying. You also use research skills in everyday life, like planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, critically exploring information, and creating your own responses are expected. Some students might find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge, but in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning knowledge and authorities is encouraged.

Critical thinking is very important in research. We need to not just repeat what we read but engage with it, think about it, and test it. We should check if the information is logical and backed by evidence, rather than just accepting it as fact. We must be careful not to rely uncritically on information given to us."
80,"Cities have always been places where people share ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural. 

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. We know that living in a city can be tiring, but new research shows that it can also make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a small view of nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from the busy city life.

This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy street, our brains have to keep track of many things: distracted people, traffic, and the confusing city layout. This constant attention is tiring because our brains have to decide what to focus on and what to ignore. 

Natural places, on the other hand, don't need as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can refresh our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Even before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people try many things to boost brain power, like energy drinks or changing office layouts, simply walking in nature seems to be very effective.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities keep growing. Why? Because the same things that make city life hard, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The many social interactions in cities drive creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a place of new ideas, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of technology and creativity. Less crowded cities might have less innovation over time.

The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people get tired of nature and want to return to the city."
81,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging techniques to support this idea. However, I believe that the study of the mind should not be limited to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in human thinking. Archaeology shows that things like stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and the development of the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might also be part of the mind.

It is easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from the objects around them. This is necessary for neuroscientists because of the limitations of brain-scanning machines. But this approach often ignores that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I am not denying the importance of the brain in thinking, but I believe the mind is more than just the brain. It is useful to consider that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world.

This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become extensions of our thinking, like when we use clay to make numbers or a stone to make a tool. It also looks at how these interactions have changed over time and what they mean for how we think. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of what objects do for the mind.

Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s sense of self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be continuous. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick becomes part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence is adaptable and can change by incorporating new technologies.

I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, from early stone tools to the internet, tools have served as pathways for humans to explore and understand the world. Unlike a monkey using a stick to get food, humans use tools to satisfy their curiosity. This unique human trait explains why we create things and how these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world.

I want to include material objects in our understanding of the mind. MET provides a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from stone axes to smartphones, have helped define and transform who we are and how we think. While mind-changing technology might sound futuristic, humans have been using it since we first evolved."
82,"Photography is one of the inventions that has greatly changed how we see the world. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became a part of American culture. It influenced many areas, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians say that photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. Photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discussions, so to understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, because it was a mechanical process, it fit well with the growing interest in technology in the US, where change was seen as normal. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world feel smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with amazing speed. Second, the camera was the best tool for showing one's self-image in a country where personal and national identities were always being created and recreated. Third, the camera was important for creating and keeping family memories, even if they were a bit idealized. Lastly, the realistic nature of photographs matched the American artists' focus on realism and everyday life. 

A photograph draws attention to something the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""This, you should see!"" Because a photograph is made by a machine, it is a record of what was in front of the camera, giving it a sense of objectivity. However, since it is taken by a person, it also has a personal point of view, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, which is why photography is often called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph is more complex. No image is shown to us without some context that affects how we understand it, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and how it was first seen. The same image can be seen in different places and times, and its meaning can change each time.

For a long time, the camera's importance to artists was not widely known, but now it is very clear. In recent decades, starting with US artist Andy Warhol, who used photographs in his paintings and other works, artists have been using photographs in many ways. In short, photography has become an essential part of art, working alongside painting to shape our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, which includes our thoughts and feelings, and we try to understand it. James was mainly interested in human psychology, which he believed included thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences, which may not always align with scientific facts. 

We often act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex topics, like brainwashing or why people behave in certain ways. Problems occur when people have different views. Formal psychology tries to find the most accurate explanations for these situations. Psychologists help us separate our personal thoughts from scientific facts. 

Psychology studies the mind and brain, but we don't fully understand the brain's role in our experiences and behaviors. It's hard to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn by observing behavior and forming ideas about what's happening inside us. Scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not directly visible. We infer them from behavior, much like solving a crossword puzzle by interpreting clues. 

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply this knowledge to improve people's lives. Psychological research has helped in areas like teaching, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings. 

Although people have discussed psychological questions for centuries, scientific study began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to study the mind, but this method has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of the brain's work. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows the other side of consumer capitalism, which is usually focused on success. Here, you can find products like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were taken off the market because almost no one wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story about the people who designed, marketed, and sold it. 

The surprising thing about the museum is that it is a successful business. You might think that companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but they often don't. Many business executives visit the museum because they don't have their own records of failures. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failures. Since the 1960s, he collected samples of every new product he could find. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection mostly consists of unsuccessful ones.

Today's culture of optimism might be why these failed products exist. Each product went through meetings where no one realized it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might spend more money on a failing product to force some sales and save face. People involved often don't talk about what went wrong. This focus on optimism is common in the growing self-help industry, where ""positive visualization"" is popular. The idea is that if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to happen. 

Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that our brains might be wired to be overly optimistic. Her research shows that well-balanced people often think they have more control over events than they actually do, unlike those with depression. However, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that thinking too positively about the future can reduce motivation. People who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck says our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a ""fixed theory"" mindset think ability is natural and unchangeable, so they see failure as proof they aren't good enough. For example, a sports star who believes he is a ""natural"" might not practice enough to improve. On the other hand, people with an ""incremental theory"" mindset believe ability grows with effort and challenges. They see failure as a sign they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger after being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."
85,"Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many theories about home advantage. On the other hand, people who manage the money in sports wonder if home advantage should matter at all. If players are paid well, shouldn't they perform well anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their support is crucial for the team. Fans often think that when they cheer loudly, it helps the team score. They remember the times when cheering led to a goal but forget the times it didn't.

However, there is one thing that fans believe which is supported by science. Home fans often try to influence the referee by making noise. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees might avoid making decisions that would upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in English football won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar. Despite these changes, home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because basketball relies more on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home.

Another reason for home advantage could be related to players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This might be a natural urge to defend their home ground. In recent rugby matches, underdog teams won at home by showing determination and aggression, which are signs of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"""The more I practise, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous among athletes and coaches. It suggests that practice leads to improvement, not actual luck. The saying is often debated, with some people thinking talent is natural, while others believe it is developed through practice. 

Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for the idea that anyone can become an expert with 10,000 hours of practice. This idea has been popularized by books like Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers"" and others that argue practice is more important than natural talent. They suggest that 10,000 hours of practice is enough to become an expert in any field. 

However, in his book, Epstein argues that this is not always true. He points out that studies often focus only on successful people, which can be misleading. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others do not, considering factors like environment, support, and determination. 

Epstein travels around the world to find answers, even looking at sled dog races in Alaska. He learns that the dogs' drive might be partly genetic, suggesting that determination could also be influenced by genes. This shows the complexity of the nature versus nurture debate. 

Epstein talks about the importance of both natural ability (nature) and practice (nurture) in sports. He believes that both are necessary for success. For example, if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of a sprinter. 

Epstein also discusses race and gender in sports. He questions why men and women compete separately if practice is the only thing that matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most important."
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature. She believes this is the main problem. This idea is supported by other studies on modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they spent time exploring outdoors, which they believe was healthier than the protected lives of children today. However, these adults often forget that they are the ones who have created these protective environments for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book includes strong arguments about the fear of outdoor dangers and how it benefits the toy and gadget industry, which sells products to keep children entertained indoors. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. While some of these rules might be exaggerated, Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly and passionately. She also discusses childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules. Although her arguments are interesting, Griffiths sometimes takes them too far and ignores important counter-arguments. For example, she compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems extreme.

Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children, often seeing them in an idealized way. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks, arguing that they need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children may want the adventurous life she describes. Some children are naturally cautious and prefer staying at home. The real issue might be forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my schooling. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, and moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We no longer need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate problems, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit if they want. This makes play democratic because players must keep each other happy to continue. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, warnings from experts, less community, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They need to follow their natural drive to play and explore to become strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to directly contact potential employers, which was once only possible by standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with this access, there is also a higher chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to use her contacts to get a job. The executive was upset by this request and sent a harsh rejection note, which went viral online. Many people who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone. However, this incident highlights the importance of using social media carefully for professional purposes. Social media can be risky for job seekers who don't know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes. 

There is an irony because social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress and experiment, often based on fantasy. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. By choosing the right pictures or songs for your Facebook page, you could become a different person overnight. But when it comes to professional networking, our experience with sites like Facebook might actually be a problem. Using social media for work is very different, but some young people don't see the difference. We first became popular online by being bold and confident, which might explain why some of us still think this is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook doesn't mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you're worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn't apply anymore, and we must meet employers' standards to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too familiar and seem arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of young people as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are desperate to find jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their job prospects, even though they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees. So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, generic messages, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it requires careful handling to avoid closing doors."
90,"Text: Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people buying UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001, according to the Pew Research Centre. Some people say that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. For example, in 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here today, even with the arrival of cinema and television. Radio has done well despite TV, and cinema has survived videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales increasing by 745% since 2008.

Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. People started to believe that everything is always changing, and they needed regular news updates. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and big events like famines or floods, which they couldn't predict. Life was seen as cyclical, with important truths repeating over time.

Journalism as a full-time job only started in the 19th century. Before that, there was no clear reason for people to need regular news. Newspapers have always had the challenge of publishing regularly and in a fixed format. Online news is different because readers can choose what news to read based on their interests. Search engines and algorithms help personalize news. Online news can update stories quickly and correct mistakes. There are no space limits, so stories can be detailed, and readers can access full documents or events mentioned in the news.

Despite these advantages, online news often focuses on being first and getting reader comments, which can create confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. In some ways, we are returning to that kind of world. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might find a way to help us understand the world better, even as the internet makes us feel like we live in a chaotic universe."
91,"If humans were comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, just like many animals that are active at night. However, we are creatures that are active during the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a basic part of our nature, even if we don't often think about it. This is why we have changed the night by adding artificial light. This change, like building a dam on a river, has benefits but also causes problems, known as light pollution. Scientists are just starting to study these effects.

Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design, which lets artificial light shine into the sky instead of focusing it on the ground. This extra light changes the natural darkness of night, affecting the light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it can affect things like migration, reproduction, and feeding.

For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the most populated city on Earth. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few houses had gas lighting, and public gaslights in the streets would not appear for another seven years. From a few miles away, you would have been more likely to smell London than see its faint glow.

We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but that is not true. Many animals, especially mammals, are active at night. Light is a strong force in nature, attracting many species. For example, songbirds and seabirds can be drawn to bright lights on land or from oil platforms at sea, flying around them until they are exhausted. Birds migrating at night can crash into brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially at risk. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at unusual times when there is artificial light.

People used to think light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. While most of us don't need a perfect view of the night sky, we do need darkness. Ignoring the need for darkness is pointless. It is as important for our health as light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can cause health problems. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping is a natural response to the Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so important that changing them is like changing our balance.

In the end, humans are affected by light pollution just like animals near bright lights. By creating so much artificial light, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the natural day-night cycle. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, which we can best understand by looking at a dark night sky with the Milky Way above us."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his company will stop keeping track of employees' paid holiday time. This idea was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. Some people think this announcement is just a way to make the company seem more friendly, but let's consider if the idea is practical.

The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn't hurt the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work better. In a big company, it's harder to know if your absence will affect the business.

The founder of the multinational company said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work is up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? Even if you prepare well before a holiday, there will always be work waiting for you when you return. This is just how taking leave works. If employees follow these rules, they might not take any leave at all, or they might feel guilty about it. Feeling guilty can lead to stress, and not taking enough leave can reduce productivity over time.

There could also be pressure from coworkers and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. This pressure already affects decisions like when to start and end the workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If the feeling of safety that comes with guaranteed leave is removed, people might feel they can't take the leave they need because they don't want to seem lazy. They wouldn't have their legal right to leave to rely on anymore.

This policy might make employees feel stuck, unable to take their leave, or they might just stick to their legal rights, making the policy useless. Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, anywhere, which has blurred the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how this new way of working could fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours accurately, why should it use an old standard for time off?

However, if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being watched, making them monitor themselves, which could be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits like better morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can happen without affecting worker well-being. I am doubtful that letting employees ""take as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts in a field review a scientific paper before it is published. This is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research by preventing flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, this process can delay publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trust in scientific literature? The answer is both yes and no. 

The world of scientific publishing is changing. While I still believe in some form of review before publication, the rise of preprints is changing things. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before peer review. They allow for quick sharing of new research so others can read, critique, and build on it. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can lead to authors cutting corners. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is suitable for a journal based on its popularity or newsworthiness, not just its scientific quality. These issues are known, but few are willing to change the current system.

Preprints might offer a solution. They have been around for twenty years but are not widely used because of misconceptions. Some believe journals won't accept papers that have been shared as preprints, and there is fear that without peer review, 'junk science' will be published. However, preprints are open for critique by a global community, which can be just as effective.

Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper critiqued another published paper, which is difficult in traditional journals. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and all discussions were open for readers to see. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments are still available, so the work is not wasted.

Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions and can be a place for sharing negative results, which are often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Papers on preprint archives are read and cited more, showing their effectiveness in spreading research. By using the internet's openness, preprints can help focus on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it’s like ‘a painting in words’. These answers don’t usually satisfy me or them. So, one day, I asked them to pick an object and write two paragraphs: one describing it like a scientist, and another from the object’s point of view, titled ‘Poem’. One student wrote: 

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. 

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. 

When I was in school, poetry didn’t make much sense to me. I thought of poems as confusing puzzles that blocked real understanding and feeling. After school, many people lose interest in poetry. Sometimes you come across a poem, and it stands out because it’s not like regular writing. It challenges you to read it, but often you feel let down because it seems plain or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we expect from poems? Aren’t they supposed to hold deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem yes. But for emotions, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, it’s hard to beat the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. 

However, poems can offer something special: ambiguity. Everyday life is full of it, unlike straightforward reading. But this doesn’t really explain what a poem is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it leads you to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of literary art using the beauty and rhythm of language’. This is academic talk, but it hides the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made’, and a poet is ‘a maker of things’. So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? 

Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – carefully made and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t hold up on closer look. The best part of comparing poems is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps us think differently and see common things in a new way. 

Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially if we think about how song lyrics stick in our heads. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes such as ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Consider a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, looking right at you: A poem can hit home like nothing else, even though, as ink on paper, it does no more than the prose around it. What about all the empty space around the poem – space that could be used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it doesn’t become a product like they do. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry books, but few expect them to make back their printing costs. A poem is not made for the market, but for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I've enjoyed finding every brooch and coin because it makes me feel connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I couldn't ignore it and started digging. I was on my stomach in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, like curtain rails I had found before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, I saw it was a thick, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared, realizing it looked like the Great Torc in the British Museum, a famous object from Iron Age Britain over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to my car and couldn't stop looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first time it had been cleaned since ancient times. I called Marion and showed her the torc. She was amazed. I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe, but I was too anxious to sleep. Eventually, I hid it under a floorboard in my office.

The law says you must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned, stopped mid-sentence, and stared at it. The torc was authenticated and sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask if I'll stop detecting now that I've found something so amazing. But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing. There's always the chance of catching an even bigger fish tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their carefully planned trips, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian beds. Better sleep is a nice bonus of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. Even with noisy birds nearby, I could sleep deeply and dream a lot. Being away from home, without alarms or responsibilities, makes sleep come easier. But I think there's more to it than just relaxing. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, and smells. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. Sleep helps us process all this new information. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with different places. People often worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local habits is harder than adjusting to time zones. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, everyone slowly stopped talking and went to rest on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I didn't just sleep; I shared a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Being in a different place with new smells, textures, and sounds makes sleep memorable. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity of all. Maybe I should stop feeling guilty and tell my friends that travel sleep is an important part of the experience too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said diplomatically to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face like a bulldog. ""But it's so boring,"" she said. ""Every woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she decided, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing, someone they knew nothing about. Her husband Jeff had quickly pointed out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff said when Mia told him, ""What kind of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it's nice."" ""Sounds pretentious,"" Jeff retorted. He didn't like anything showy or fake. He also didn't believe in being too polite, which he called Mia's reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn't have hesitated to tell the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said a trash can lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you're too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and went into the back door of Medlar House. Her commute from work was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends who struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions that there was definitely a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website for the business, Mia's Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham. In a relaxed and welcoming environment, she let them try on as many hats as they needed to find the right one. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits so nothing was left to chance. She recently expanded her service to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It's a long journey from London to Atlanta, and Lawrence Okoye is reflecting on his incredible sports career. He is confident but also surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Even though he has never played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen by a top team in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still learning about his new position in the sport. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports seems unbelievable. But Lawrence is used to proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on discus instead, after playing rugby. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training to prepare for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in American football, he says, ""American football was in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I had thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then."" After arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ""Pretty much,"" he says simply. He applied online and wasn't nervous about competing against experienced players. ""No, not at all. I don’t get nervous for many things,"" he says. Lawrence is not very talkative, but he is confident in his abilities. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ""I was very pleased to hear that,"" he says, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is also cautious. He knows he lacks experience. How can someone so new to the sport make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have all the qualities needed. It's just about how hard I work,"" he replies. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? ""I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I’ll be selected, but I’m not too worried."" This calm attitude might come from his disappointing Olympic final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved past this and is happy he made it to the final with an impressive last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he says. ""The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sport. I can always return to it."" After the Olympics, some thought the experience had affected him negatively. Lawrence doesn't comment on this. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his physical talents, wouldn't it be better to focus on one sport? ""I understand why someone would say that,"" he responds. ""I’m trying to achieve something I dreamed about as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been well thought out."""
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, winter had not yet started in Siberia. I saw no signs of human life, just an endless view of mountains, streams, and forests. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to a remote area to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, I will be riding with a friend named Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and said ""Holodna"" (cold) while pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling. Plus, there were long holidays for adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was his biggest so far. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong those who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to participate. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned I needed to stay oriented. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" I was told, and the pilot would explain where to look. I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. 

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. As we were moving down the runway, my legs were up, trying not to touch the steering pedals, and my hands were avoiding the switches. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense up and relax at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea. This was not comforting as we started accelerating. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we quickly turned right. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach high up and my lungs feeling compressed. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for a small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was interrupted by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even done any acrobatics yet. 

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too—it’s very responsive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience when racing. To show this, Dario got out some sandwiches as soon as we landed and started eating happily. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night I dreamed of doing loops over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you've ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. He says his perfect temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned how to survive in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. 'I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.' He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. 'I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had people who specialized in coral, elephants, chimpanzees. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.' The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. 'It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.' 'My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.' Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very difficult. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. 'We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera's locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye's very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She's looking at me but she's not bothered. I've just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can't get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I'd swear it's partly in sheer pleasure,' he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. 'Clearly it's their first view of the world … It's show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.' Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim through very cold water and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even bigger expedition. Explorers are confident and determined people, and they need to be. This time, there is more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer journey to the North Pole, measuring the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar region. Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tough by sending him out into the cold Scottish mountains with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in the cold, and Pen had unusual physical strength. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he is at home because he is often thinking about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horses compete against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. Pen says it is harder to leave them this time. When he last went, his children were one and five years old. He made a mistake by telling his son, ""You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister."" His son took it very seriously, which was too much pressure. Because of this, Pen plans to have little contact with them while in the Arctic. ""If you call them, you remind them how far away you are,"" he says. He is spending his last days before leaving getting his equipment ready. ""Out on the ice, you can’t fix things easily,"" he explains. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer, will join him. A team of six will fly in supplies to support them. Being part of a team is more stressful for Pen, and he is also worried about his age. ""I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I haven’t trained as much as I’d like,"" he says. Why? ""Organizing things always seems more urgent. So I’m almost afraid of what I’m going to ask of myself."" Pen believes his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge, like past explorers. ""Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,"" he admits, ""and not very useful to others. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re trying to involve as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,"" he says. ""Our skills, which seemed strange and not useful before, are now very important. Suddenly, we’re useful to society again."""
103,"I took a year off and wondered what to do next. Being an Olympian is amazing, and I had opportunities to write, work on TV, and speak at schools and businesses. But I missed having a competitive goal. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to try for the Olympics again, so I entered marathons and triathlons. That was good, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready for intense training. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. I knew if I joined, I would want to win. I wasn't sure if Ben was the best partner for winning, but being an underdog sounded fun. 

Ben was already planning to race and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the costs, which were high, with the boat and equipment alone costing £70,000. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take effort to secure everything. I also had to consider the loss of income from being away, as speaking at business events is a good way to earn money after retiring from sports. It's nice that people are interested, but I prefer having a new goal to talk about. Rowing across the Atlantic would give me something new to share.

Planning this adventure taught me to appreciate the simpler life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but everything was organized with doctors and dieticians. I worried about how people would see me racing with a TV presenter, thinking it might look like I just wanted to be on TV. But during our preparations, those worries faded. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about mental strength than just rowing. Ben had done tough challenges like the Marathon des Sables and spent time at sea and on a deserted island. However, he couldn't row well. I was surprised by his lack of skill, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have expected his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty spaces, maybe because of the noise and crowded life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm', which they said was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away.

November 6, London On my flight, I look at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies. I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out the window instead. People say that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of flowers and leaves opening. But I think I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests with thin conifers covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely inside when I’m given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes very loud by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, pulling out huskies and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost crazy with excitement, pulling hard on the ropes to start running. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much anyway. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I face tough questions about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m unsure. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in freezing conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around by overexcited huskies. But I feel triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after a training accident where she ran into a bike. Radcliffe says the achievement didn't really sink in at the time. She felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits.

During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep up the fast pace, fearing she might drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, but he understood why someone might think it was risky to start so fast if they didn't know how fit she was.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers very fast but still managed to sprint the last distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run quicker than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't expect anyone to come close to that time soon. Radcliffe thought she would return and do it again next year, but unfortunately, that didn't happen.

After the race, people wondered how Radcliffe, with her awkward running style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her for weeks, helping her manage the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle that level of pain like her."" Hartmann would travel 13 hours from Ireland to her training base in France, and as soon as he arrived, Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour session. She pushed him to give his best, which made her so good.

During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes became resentful. Radcliffe herself can't fully explain why no one has beaten her record. She trained very hard, but she believes there are more talented people out there. She thought Mary Keitany might break her record. Radcliffe thinks maybe people are racing each other more than pushing themselves to their limits. She always pushed herself hard, even when she was winning.

Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She never ran as fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I didn't know how people would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our show added something new to this movement, but I was still worried. Would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques, but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether it's exploring the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often very physical, involving travel with passports and suitcases. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series. In it, you travel around the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes a special golden pasta. These people have spent years trying to achieve their own idea of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was left out. But after a long meeting, the TV team and I came up with a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of what perfection is, based on their emotions, memories, and surroundings. I knew from the start that I wasn't claiming the recipes were 'perfect'. But I thought that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food experts, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying new ideas and changing them until you have something unique. The TV series allowed me to explore foods, people, and places I hadn't seen before, and I was excited about that. Searching for the best ingredients took me around the world. Some of my adventures included visiting a canning factory that processed the wrong type of tomato and a dairy farm with low standards where we couldn't film. To perfect each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital scanner, and almost burning my house down trying to make a Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a few hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and suddenly went off the road into a field, stopping completely. John got out and looked under the hood of the van. He stood there for a long time, looking at the engine with his hands in his pockets, pretending to know what he was doing. Finally, he admitted, ""Actually, I have no idea what I'm doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried and said, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was large, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea, saying, ""No, we can't stay here forever,"" because it was always safe to agree with her. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass and asked me to tell a story. Bea lay next to her and encouraged me to tell one. So, I told them about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything the birds talked about, like breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. I even told them about the birds arguing over a worm. Bea said, ""That's silly, no one understands bird language."" My eyes felt like they were burning. ""I do,"" I said, but I didn't sound convincing. ""Liar,"" Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ""Mum...?"" But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a hotel. Bea didn't want to get out, but the boys didn't mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back door windows. We followed John into a café near the road where our van was parked. ""It's a hotel,"" John whispered. ""It might be expensive."" ""We'll just have some tea,"" Mum said, and we sat in the shade on the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot and said, ""It's like syrup in there."" We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the engine. ""It's a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum made beds for us with blankets in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn't moving. ""I'll have to get us towed into Marrakech,"" John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John driving it. At first, Bea didn't want to move, so John carried her into the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home since our van needed to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like Lucy. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, but Lucy didn't catch her name because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing and their travel plans.

Lucy mentioned she might go to the Tanglewood festival that summer. It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She often did things like concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. But Lucy hadn't applied herself; her mom did it for her. Her mom said she didn't want Lucy to be disappointed if she didn't get in. Lucy thought it was more about not giving her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy thought causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn't try to back out.

The guy from Tokyo seemed surprised when Lucy mentioned Tanglewood. He asked her age, and she said she was fifteen. He and Liesel/Louisa exchanged a look, and Liesel/Louisa said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't mean to brag. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was too much. Liesel/Louisa then excused herself to talk to someone else. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked if Lucy had ever been to Japan. He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were cool. Lucy said she had been to Japan once when she was eight. Before he could reply, Lucy's grandfather came over and took her away to introduce her to someone. He told her not to get too friendly with the competition. Lucy said they weren't the competition, but her grandfather insisted everyone was.

Her grandfather took her around the room to talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, only catching about half of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather told her she did well and that he was proud of her. He said the festival was important and that people were talking about her. Lucy liked being somebody, even if it made some people jealous or think she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special to the kids she used to go to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro well. But in places like the festival, she knew she mattered."
109,"""Dad said, 'Spending too much time online isn't good for you. You need to experience the real world.' It's hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about it, and it's quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of who they are, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a key part of growing up today. Teenagers don't just use media for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do; they live in it. It's not about whether it's good or bad, but how you use it that matters.

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it's like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, where today's parents used to go to share jokes and gossip. It helps teenagers develop their identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and interact with their peers.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says adolescence is a time to ask, 'Who am I?' Social networking can help you find your identity by letting you share your favorite music or sports, discover what you like, and see that others have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are less self-centered than those who don't use social media. He also says that social media can be helpful if you're shy because communicating online can be easier than face-to-face, allowing you to practice social skills in a less intimidating way.

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with specific interests connect with others who share those interests. For example, if only a few people at your school like a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a group online with similar interests, you can feel popular in a different way.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people, and create their own content are really using social networks well. She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force, with teenagers making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity, allowing photographers to connect, learn, and share images, which can help in the workplace. Every business uses social media to sell and build brand awareness, so understanding how it works is important. For example, if you create a product and have 1,000 friends on social networks, they could be potential customers. Linking these networks can create a customer base.

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they start working, agrees Matthews. Many sites offer the chance to collaborate with others to create and share content. Collaboration is a key skill for the 21st century and important for being employable in a digital age."""
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they probably don't imagine a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents had a different idea for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan what many teenagers would consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. Before the trip, my parents kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There's probably a good reason for that!""

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and all kinds of clothes to prepare for any weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home for smaller accommodations over the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest, star-filled skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way!

The next day, we were up early and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. As we climbed to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dodging construction traffic became normal. We laughed as we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument.

We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common, and our own close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its creaky floors and no internet or cell phone service, couldn't dampen our spirits. In exchange, I got to see the most amazing views I've ever seen.

After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, my family and I headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic foreign place to find something amazing. It was both happy and sad to be home again, but at least I hadn't fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos of our crazy journey to look through and remember. For me, the best memories were the unplanned and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay because it was her final year, and she was happy to have the best room at the college, with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still keep an eye on Amy.

Rose was moving to her grandmother's house. She only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose's parents were not very excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn't fully understand why her parents didn't get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Rose was ten years old the last time she saw her grandmother, but she had happy memories.

Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked bringing people together. Rose expected to receive dinner invitations, coffee morning requests, and shopping trips soon. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady and seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England. Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was mature and knew about healthy living. She wanted independence, like playing music loudly, inviting friends over, or going out without always asking for permission. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late.

Daisy understood, and Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed to trust each other: Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were any problems, they would talk about it. Rose was not a wild child, and her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and start her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this would be the last time because she was starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed challenging, unlike other activities teenagers might do, like competing in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. Charlotte recently told her former teacher, who was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book at 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't see why she should wait to do something she might be good at.

On a winter afternoon at her publisher's office, I met Charlotte, a 15-year-old girl who has written a book. The book is impressive: the story is confident and full of action. Except for the age of the main character, nothing suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support, but she is independent and confident, with a lively intelligence and a steady demeanor that keeps her from being overconfident.

Charlotte admits she is young and doesn't have all the answers. When asked about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t think my understanding of the world is limited by my age, but I’m not particularly wise either. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.""

She has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in books. She believes there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who lacks social skills. She found these stereotypes frustrating. ""What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who aren’t inadequate in some way. Some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.""

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I was capable of it."" However, she praises a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which advises that if the reader can guess what happens next, the suspense is lost.

Some might think Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get published. Her father's connection in publishing did help get her book read initially. She acknowledges her luck, as getting a first novel read is difficult, regardless of the author's age. ""Every aspiring writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you’re on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talents, so I don’t take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show he knew what he was doing, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp fast and flew up, arms flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle stuff. On past skiing holidays, I liked practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how, and I was afraid of being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students jumped, tried new tricks, and landed in foam pits – not a real introduction to what was ahead on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – once you’re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again to become the landing zone. Land in the zone and you keep moving forward, minimizing impact. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which is painful. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain and race towards the jump. My legs would almost go backward as I neared the launch point, so I came down hard on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines in the center. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was addictive. Some drills copied moves we’d make while ski-jumping, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing as you spun in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, and then I was in the foam cubes next to the trampoline. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a few moments, I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last long. On the final run of the day, I forced myself not to slow down as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly in the landing zone. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you grip the safety harness tightly. The ride stops for a moment, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs up. There is a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose to be here, like millions of others who visit theme parks every year.

Amusement parks are a big business, attracting people with exciting rides. Behind these rides are large teams of creative engineers and designers. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it is a real and challenging career. Designers must create rides that are both thrilling and safe, while also offering something new to keep visitors interested.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most of the techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers must work within the limits set by ride manufacturers.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, an engineering expert, explained that it's about quickly changing directions to make people feel excited but safe. The goal is to create a ride that tells a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, with features like the tallest ride or the most twists.

Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and testing are key. Jeff Hornick, a theme park development director, agreed that designers need to understand what passengers want and test the rides themselves. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoaster design. Walker said that while technology can add to the experience, the physical ride will always be the main attraction."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both activities with her busy schedule. She says, ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio, taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day long.’ As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching young students. ‘A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re willing to take risks. They want success, but they don’t yet know their strengths and weaknesses. This means they accept even harsh criticism. They might still question me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There might be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece. I’d like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces – it’d help lift the mood when rehearsals are tough. But I’m always working on big productions where the music is already decided by the composer and can’t be changed.’

Miranda doesn’t want to work with just one institution. ‘I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that all the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to adapt each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’

We talk about a recent documentary on ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one tries to show viewers what life is really like in a dance company. There was a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized it. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch but not made up for the cameras. The public underestimates the work and dedication involved in ballet.’

I ask what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. That’s disappointing.’

Miranda has done many different works, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to focus on one narrow area. I don’t follow that, though maybe one day I’ll be known for doing one thing. For now, I want to explore more.’"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? This conversation gave me the idea for a crazy four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main part of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to secure myself. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Several friends joined me during the trip, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to continue. I have been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino, instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I often told people, ""No, I'm not doing it for charity, and I'm not training for a marathon."" When someone at work asks about my weekend, I prefer to explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England rather than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. At the Greek port, the man seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although he still looked puzzled, he let me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, though, and was happy when I finally did it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, my speed and enjoyment increased. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant isn't easy, but it's a great job for a young person like me. Since I started, I've traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with amazing people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, so I often flew alone. I felt lonely and would ask flight attendants if I could help give out meals, and some let me. This experience stayed with me when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new career. At the interview, there were many young people, and many were accepted. They were often well-qualified and changing careers, like me. I practiced what to say before the interview, focusing on my strengths and work experience, not just my love for travel. I got the job! I recommend this work to anyone because there are many benefits, but free flights aren't the main one. Airline staff work very hard, and there's a saying: ""no-one's finished till everyone's finished."" It's like a big family. Even if we don't see each other often, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to take work home. If I have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won't see them again."
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children succeed at things they didn't think they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel very nervous, but with some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel really good. At the start of the week, some children miss home. Surprisingly, it's not the very young ones who feel this way the most; it's usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's a bit late to call now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine after a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call a lot to ask how their child is doing, which isn't really necessary. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back later. We often see a certain type of child come to camp, usually wearing expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."
120,"""Rock the Planet"" is a musical show where the actors also need to be great musicians. It started in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won the 'Best Musical' award four times. However, using an all-British cast was challenging because the UK has stricter rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first 'Best Musical' award. The London theatre is bigger than the one in the USA, but it has been full every night because everyone wants to hear the songs that were first popular in America.

I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ""It's amazing that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar."" He explained how busy the young actors are. ""We have regular school lessons at the theatre every day. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends."" I asked what his friends think of the show. ""My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it's expensive for them,"" he said.

When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found an extra one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called ""Days,"" which I didn't know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie's talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show's director wasn't there to hear my mistakes!

The young actors were already musicians, and some played several instruments, but none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it's definitely worth seeing."
