1,C2,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins. This means telling everyone online where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you are also telling everyone, even people you don't know, that you are not at home. This made people think about the problems of sharing too much online. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. This can be exciting because it might bring us money or fame. So, we share personal stories and photos online. But later, we might find out that this can be dangerous and confusing.
But don't worry, there is hope. A long time ago, some people started using the internet in new ways. They were the first bloggers. They shared their lives online and learned from their mistakes. We can learn from them too. In 1994, a student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the internet. He wrote about everything and posted photos. People liked reading about his life. But one day, he had to stop because it caused problems in his personal life. He learned that sharing too much can make people not trust you.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong had a blog where she sometimes wrote about her job. One day, someone at her work shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. But Heather's story ended well. She got married, started writing about her family, and became a successful ""mommy blogger."" She learned to share carefully online.
The lesson here is that the internet lets us say anything, but we should be careful about what we share."
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Scientists usually agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists were worried about the film and called it ""atrocious"" and ""dangerous."" 
At first, the film seemed harmless. It showed scientists saying that new discoveries make the universe seem stranger than we thought. But then, the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher said that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by happy people and looking bad after being around unhappy people. Some people found this evidence convincing, but many scientists did not. They wanted more proof.
The film's claims were not strange enough. Scientists have found that water molecules have properties because of a form of energy that seems to come from nowhere. This energy is linked to a force that is making the universe expand. This is not just based on pictures; it comes from years of research. Scientists have discovered that the universe is made of unknown matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy.""
Other discoveries are also amazing. Neuroscientists found that our brain takes about half a second to understand what we see, but we don't notice this delay. Anthropologists think they know where modern humans first lived and why they moved to other places. Some scientists believe there are links between life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Science is not finished. We are learning that many natural things cannot be fully understood. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show limits to what we can know. Some physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all forces and particles in the universe. Many people think the universe is best described in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"I find writing novels difficult, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, and writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both are important to me. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind moves the leaves. In the garden, flowers bloom, and bees and butterflies come. This shows how seasons change. Since I started writing, I switch between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories. After finishing short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write both at the same time. Writing novels and short stories might use different parts of the brain, so I need time to change from one to the other. I started with two short novels in 1975, and then I wrote short stories from 1984 to 1985. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was hard, but I remember it well. Writing short stories made my fictional world bigger. Readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story book, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is nice because they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to make a short story good (though I can revise it many times). It's not like writing a novel, which takes a year or two and is very tiring. With short stories, you can finish quickly. Writing a novel feels like it takes forever, and I sometimes wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change. You can make a short story from small things – an idea, a word, or an image. It's like jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. If a short story doesn't work, it's okay. Not every story is great, even for famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. This makes me feel better. You can learn from mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories. Short stories are like a test for me as a novelist. It's hard to try new things in a novel, so short stories help me. My short stories are like shadows or footprints I leave behind. I remember each one and how I felt when I wrote it. Short stories show my feelings, and I like sharing them with my readers."
4,C2,"Science is a big part of our lives. It helps us understand the world and can cure diseases. Science can make life easier, but it can also be dangerous if not understood well. Scientists try to learn about everything, from tiny atoms to the huge universe. Science changes a lot because new ideas come and old ones go. Sometimes, new ideas are not accepted at first, but later they become important. Scientists often disagree, but this helps science grow.
Science is not just about making things like non-stick pans. It is about big ideas that change how we think. Science is always changing. One scientist might prove another scientist wrong. This usually does not change our daily lives, but sometimes it changes what we believe. For example, in the past, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Now, we know it is more complex.
Some people think science cannot explain everything, but it helps us understand more and more. Famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein helped us learn a lot. Science sometimes makes mistakes, but it keeps moving forward. In the past, people thought there was nothing new to learn in physics, but then many new things were discovered, like X-rays and black holes.
Science is important for our future. We have learned to control some parts of nature, but we must be careful not to harm it. Everyone should understand science because it affects our lives and the world our children will live in. Science helps us plan for the future, and it is important for everyone, not just scientists or philosophers. The choices we make in science can affect our health, money, and even life on Earth."
5,C2,"'Around 2015, big publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped growing or even went down. This made people question if ebooks would be important in the future. One publishing boss said that the excitement about ebooks made his company invest too much and forget how important printed books are. Even though digital and print books can both exist, people still ask if ebooks will replace printed books. This idea makes us think and talk a lot. Why do we see ebooks and print books as fighting each other? This is not just about books. It shows how we feel excited and scared about new things. In my research, I found that people often think new technology will replace old ones. For example, when TV was invented, people thought radio would disappear, but radio survived by being used in cars and other places. The idea of books disappearing is not new. In 1894, people thought phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This has happened many times with movies, radio, TV, and smartphones. Some people think losing books would be bad for culture, while others think ebooks are better. This idea comes up when new technology appears because it shows our hopes and fears about change. We have strong feelings about things like books, TVs, and computers because they are part of our lives. When new technology like e-readers comes, it changes our connection with these things. We might miss what we used to have. That's why people like old things, like vinyl records or silent movies, when new things come. E-readers made people appreciate old books more, even their smell. This should comfort those worried about print books disappearing. But the idea of losing old things will always be interesting because it shows how technology changes us and how we don't like change. We use stories about endings to understand change. The story of books disappearing shows our excitement for the future and our fear of losing what we know and love.'"
6,C2,"'Almost every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the smartest people in the last four hundred years did their best work. I wanted to know how they found time each day to be creative and productive. By writing about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to show that they were like us, with habits and routines. The French food expert Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.’ I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.’ This book is about the daily life of creative people, not their work. It’s also personal. The writer John Cheever thought that even a business letter shows something about you – isn’t that true? In my book, I think about questions I have in my own life: How do you do creative work and also make money? Is it better to work on a project all at once or a little each day? When there isn’t enough time, do you give up things like sleep or a clean house, or do you learn to do more in less time? I don’t have all the answers, but I show how different successful people faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas come from small daily actions; how your work habits affect your work, and the other way around. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about routines. A routine can seem boring, but it can help you use your time, energy, and optimism well. A good routine helps you focus and not be controlled by your moods. The psychologist William James thought you should put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to do more interesting things.’ Ironically, James himself often procrastinated and couldn’t stick to a schedule. This book started because I was procrastinating. One Sunday, I was alone at the architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was cleaning my desk and making coffee. I’m a ‘morning person’ and can focus well in the morning but not after lunch. That afternoon, I looked online for other writers’ work schedules. I found many and thought someone should collect these stories – so I started the Daily Routines blog and now this book. The blog was simple; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and newspapers. For the book, I collected more stories and did more research, but kept the short and varied voices that made the blog interesting. I let my subjects speak for themselves with quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t be possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide you to more reading.'"
7,C1,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, decided they could not go on holiday to Spain because of high interest rates. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. This made him want to become a palaeontologist. At university, he decided he wanted to study the very early life forms, not dinosaurs. He worked hard on his studies and finished his doctoral thesis. He worried about finding a job, but he believed in himself. 
When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied. On the day of the interview, the professor who was supposed to help another candidate had an accident and could not attend. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, helped Howard get the job instead. Howard was happy to get the job, even though he later learned it was because of the professors' disagreement. 
Howard liked his job because he could plan his work. But he knew that life could be unpredictable. One day, his briefcase with important lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. He was upset but went back to the college and had coffee with a colleague and a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils there. This was a big opportunity for him. He changed his plans to visit the museum in Nairobi, which would help his career. 
*An ammonite is a type of fossil."
8,C1,"Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to change the way we taste food. At home, he even has ice cream made from bee larvae, which tastes a bit like nuts and flowers. Spence and his team are trying to make eating bugs more normal. They study how things like who we eat with, how food looks, and even background noise can change how food tastes.
Spence wrote a book called ""The Perfect Meal"" with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman. It has many interesting facts about eating. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their food the most. Also, we eat more when we are with other people.
Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and not very high-tech. He works with cooks who can't pay for research themselves. His work is often paid for by big food companies. These companies want to reduce salt and sugar in their products without people noticing. They do it slowly so customers don't taste the change.
Spence also works with famous chefs like Heston Blumenthal. Together, they created a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"" that uses sound to change how food tastes. Spence found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon use music to make food taste better for passengers.
At home, Spence has fun dinner parties. Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colored lights and sounds to see how it changed the taste of drinks. For Spence, home and work are closely connected."
9,C1,"Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, some true and some not, and we have to decide what is important. We also do more things ourselves now. For example, we book our own flights and find things in shops without help. We try to do many things at once, like work, family, hobbies, and watching TV, with the help of our smartphones. But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at the same time, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a brain expert, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we multitask, we switch quickly from one thing to another, and this makes us less efficient. Multitasking can make us stressed and confused. It also makes our brains want more new things to look at. The part of the brain that helps us focus is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask can make us perform worse. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while having an unread email can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. Multitasking can be worse than being tired. Russ Poldrack, another brain expert, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV, the information goes to a part of the brain for skills, not facts. Without TV, it goes to a part of the brain that helps remember facts better. Multitasking also means making many decisions, which is hard for our brains. Even small decisions can make us tired and lead to bad choices. Many people say email is a big problem because of the large number of messages. A colleague's son said his father just answers emails all day, which is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do this and finish other tasks."
10,C1,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think these questions were important. Scientists studied animal actions and their results, but not their feelings. They thought animals did not have feelings or morals. But now, this is changing. Scientists are starting to study animal emotions, like in bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens. This has led to books like ""Wild Justice"" by Mark Bekoff and ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"" by Victoria Braithwaite. These studies have started a debate: do animals have feelings and a sense of right and wrong? 
In one study, cows had to open a gate to get food. Cows that opened the gate themselves were happier than those that needed help. This suggests cows like solving problems. What does this mean for eating beef? Some people, like Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, think we should stop eating meat. He believes this is a big change in how we think about animals, like when slavery ended. Professor Aubrey Manning thinks we should rethink how smart animals are. He says animals have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop thinking animals are like humans. 
The main issue is not just science or morals, but philosophy. It is hard to define what consciousness is. Can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an experiment with starlings, a type of bird. At Newcastle University, starlings were put in two groups. One group had nice cages, and the other had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box. Later, when only bad worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages ate them. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt sad about life. Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, believes we will one day see animals like we see racism now. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger. 
If Balcombe was the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning wrote a book about animal behavior. He says our views on animals are changing. In the past, people thought animals were like humans, then they thought the opposite. Now, we are changing again. It is a difficult topic, and people have strong opinions."
11,C1,"Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear better. Adrian West, a research director, says that people think arguments help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve problems and think deeply. We see a lot of information and opinions, which can make it hard to think clearly. More data does not always mean more knowledge or better decisions. Reading books has decreased, and some people, like Patricia Greenfield, think this affects our critical thinking. We focus more on quick media and doing many things at once instead of concentrating on one thing. We don't know exactly how technology affects thinking, but it changes how we think. Computers and the internet can be good or bad for thinking, depending on how we use them. Reading helps us think and imagine, while visual media like video games and TV do not. However, visual media can improve some information processing. Many young people do not use their full potential because of this. How we see technology affects how we think about critical thinking. Video games and learning are a big part of this discussion. James Paul Gee, a professor, says video games can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and thinking skills. They let people explore ideas in a way that is like the real world. In the digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects thinking."
12,C1,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He wrote a book about why working with your hands is good. His new book talks about how to live in the modern world. He got the idea when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. He thinks these ads make it hard for us to focus on what we want to think about. 
Crawford says that because of these distractions, we don't talk to strangers as much. We see the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can control what we want. Many people feel the same way. For example, some office workers complain about emails but still check them all the time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can make us lose focus.
Crawford believes that technology makes us think more about ourselves. We often choose to send texts instead of talking to people. This can make us lose real connections with others. He gives an example of a gym where people used to share music, but now everyone listens to their own music with earphones. This change makes the gym less social.
Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, we should do activities that make us focus on real things, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us connect with the world and other people. They also help us focus better and feel more satisfied."
13,C1,"""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often talk about our jobs. But for me, as a philosopher, it is a bit harder to answer. Saying you are a philosopher can sound like you think you know more than others. But philosophers are just like everyone else. People think philosophers judge others and love thinking. A Greek philosopher, Aristotle, said thinking is the best way to live. Another philosopher, Socrates, said we should think about our lives to make them better. This does not mean reading many books. It means looking at our daily lives to see if they are good. Philosophy should help us live better lives. 
Today, philosophy in universities is often far from real life. Philosophers write in expensive journals that most people cannot read. This makes philosophy seem hard to understand. Many philosophers do not try to change this. They focus on small, difficult topics. This is not good. Philosophy should be part of everyday life. 
I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I study ethics, which is about right and wrong actions. But ethics is more than just rules and laws. It looks at if things like downloading movies illegally are wrong. It also looks at bigger ideas like responsibility and art. Philosophy helps us think about our actions and beliefs. By doing this, we can help everyone live better."""
14,C1,"People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and others, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. In the past, talking about food was not as important as talking about other big ideas. Sometimes, when philosophers talked about eating, they used it to explain other things, like learning. Sometimes, they talked about food, but it was really about other ideas. An old Greek philosopher named Epicurus talked about enjoying life and avoiding pain in many ways. But now, people think of him as someone who loved eating and drinking. We see his name in restaurants and food shops because they think it will help them sell more. Food is very social and cultural. It comes from history and is shared with people around us. We eat with others and get our food from our community. We deal with food more than anything else, so it is a good topic to think about. After food is made, people talk and write about it. But why do some people have a special role in this? One philosopher said that tasting food is not a special skill, but some people are just better at describing it. Most studies about how we see things have not looked much at taste, and this should change. Another part of food is how it looks and feels. We say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers think food should be talked about like art. But food is eaten and gone, unlike art that stays. There are many questions about what we should eat, like organic or vegetarian. Our choices show what we believe is right. Philosophers ask why we make these choices. Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a duty to their guests because of love and friendship. In restaurants, cooks have duties to their boss and the food. Their kitchens are for trained people, and they work with colleagues, not friends. A recent essay talks about how food can help connect different cultures. We can learn about others by enjoying their food and eating together, which has been important in international meetings. The essay uses fun stories to show this part of food philosophy to everyone."
15,C1,"Rob Daviau is from the US and makes special board games called 'legacy' games. He thought old board games were not fun or challenging anymore. He wanted to make games with a story. He changed a game called Risk to make Risk Legacy. In this game, choices you make stay for the next time you play. You might have to tear cards or change the board. The game has a set number of times you play, and players remember past actions. Daviau also helped make a legacy version of Pandemic, a game where players stop diseases. His next game was SeaFall, where players explore new lands in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century). Making legacy games is hard because designers must think about all player choices. They use testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga tested SeaFall and said it takes a lot of time. Sometimes the game works well at first but then breaks, and they have to fix it. People did not think legacy games would be very popular. Daviau thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved them. He thinks they are exciting and new. Ben Hogg, another fan, likes the adventure in legacy games. He says it's like watching a new movie, not the same one again. Legacy games are like video games and TV shows with episodes. Daviau wanted to write for TV but ended up making games. He likes telling stories in games. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock says making a legacy game is like writing a book. You need to know how it starts and ends. Daviau is happy to see others use his idea but thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the company that made SeaFall, thinks legacy games change how we see board games."
16,C1,"'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online. People like stories about animals escaping, like rats and llamas, because they think animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart, even though they look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and play in a smart way. Some people think it is not scientific to say animals are like humans, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, says it is important to see the human-like traits in animals. He calls it 'anthropodenial' when people do not see these traits. Animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. In the past, people thought animals were smart. In medieval times, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, who created the theory of evolution, said the difference between humans and animals is not big. In the 20th century, people started to see animals as machines that respond to rewards and punishments. This was also a time when humans were destroying animal habitats and not caring for animal welfare. But now, de Waal believes we are starting to understand animal intelligence better. He says the best tests for animal intelligence consider the animal's special skills. For example, squirrels are good at remembering where they hide nuts, even if they are not good at human memory tasks. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, Sy Montgomery says if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we are not smart because we cannot change our skin color. De Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean, but he knows that stories like this help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got upset. A video of this experiment convinced many people that animals can feel envy. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways.'"
17,C1,"Robots were once just in science fiction stories, but now they are becoming very important in our world. Robots have been used in car factories for many years, but soon they will be used in many other jobs too. Many people think robots will do most of the work humans do now in the next 50 years. However, most people also think their own jobs will still be the same. This is not true. All jobs will change because of robots.
For example, an Australian company made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This is much faster than two people can do in a day. In San Francisco, a robot named Tally helps in supermarkets by checking if products are on the shelves and priced correctly.
Some people say robots will create new jobs for people who can fix and program them. But others worry that robots will take away jobs that need people skills. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots will change jobs. He says that soon, many robots will be able to work with humans safely. Big companies will have special managers for robots, and governments will make new rules for them.
In five years, people working with robots will earn more money, but there will not be enough skilled workers for all the jobs. Dr. Zhang says people need to learn new skills because they cannot do the same job forever. New robots will also be made for homes and will be more advanced than ever before.
This change is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. Many jobs are at risk, so education is important to prepare for the future with robots. Countries need more people studying science, technology, engineering, and maths to stay competitive."
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous mountain climber, was once asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He answered, ""Because it's there."" Many people wonder why someone would do something so dangerous. Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams. It shows that climbing can be about adventure and fun. 
In 1967, a writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay about climbing. He said there are seven different types of climbing, like climbing small rocks or big mountains. Each type has its own rules. The way you climb depends on these rules. This idea is now very popular among climbers.
Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. But sometimes, climbing can feel limiting, like when you are stuck in a tent during a storm. This is a bit of a puzzle, but some people think that having fewer choices can make life simpler and more free.
Another climber, Joe Fitschen, thinks we should ask, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is in our nature. We like to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it's risky. This is part of who we are.
Brian Treanor, a US academic, says climbing can help us develop good qualities like courage and respect for nature. He thinks these are important in today's world. Climbing can help us grow and live better lives.
Some climbers believe that climbing without help from others or technology is more challenging and deserves more respect. Ebert and Robinson, two expert climbers, said that climbing alone is harder and riskier. This idea caused some debate because it might encourage dangerous climbing.
Climbing can also be about being in the moment and focusing on the climb. This is similar to Zen philosophy, which teaches people to find peace in their minds. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,B2,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel was very important in classical music. He was a serious and smart person who played and recorded many famous European piano pieces. He wrote and played a lot, but he did not teach much. People who knew him well saw that he could be fun, but he did not show this in his concerts. He was always studying, traveling, and performing. 
Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not think it was a good idea. He had not taught many students before. He said, ‘You don’t need a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something special about Kit, who was about 14 years old then. Brendel listened to him play and was very impressed. Kit played very well and remembered all the music. He even gave Brendel a CD of a concert he did, and Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit’s performance was very special.
As Brendel is stopping his public performances, Kit is starting his career. Brendel is careful because he does not want Kit to get tired too quickly. Kit, now 19, is always busy. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, and plays tennis. His mother is always with him. Kit also writes music. Brendel says this is important because writing music helps you understand it better. Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. He listens carefully to his own playing and to Brendel’s advice. When Brendel explains something, Kit understands and can do it.
Brendel is careful not to make people expect too much from Kit. He does not like it when newspapers say Kit will be the best pianist of the 21st century. This can be harmful because Kit is still learning. He can play some things very well, but he needs more time and experience for others.
Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says, ‘When I was young, I did not want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. When I was 50, I had done most of those things, but I wanted to do more, so I continued. Now, I do not have the strength to play, but I still think about music. It’s a nice new part of my life.’"
20,B2,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were always beautiful places. My Grandad's garden was not in a dirty city. It was next to a river and went down gently to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a place to escape and find peace. Grandad's garden was simple. He didn't have a greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows, with plastic covering broken glass.
At home, my father was often quiet. He wasn't boring, though. He liked funny things and had favorite phrases like ""It's immaterial to me,"" which means ""I don't mind."" He probably wished he had done more with his life. He left school without finishing and became a plumber. He didn't love plumbing; it was just his job. He wasn't very ambitious, but once he and my mom thought about moving to Canada, but it didn't happen. He was good at fixing things at home, like making bookshelves or cupboards.
My parents moved house only once. But my mom liked to change furniture often. One big change was when we got a piano. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mom thought they were too fancy and took them away. I never got to play the piano. My sister had lessons instead. When I asked my mom why I didn't get lessons, she said, ""You'd never have practiced.""
I liked going to the river. I could imagine another world there. I would take a fishing net and wear old sandals. I walked along the river, looking for a place to take off my sandals and look for fish. I tried to keep the fish at home, but it didn't work, so I put them back in the river.
I wanted to leave school as soon as I could. One day, my father said, ""There's a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it."" My dad usually wanted me to be a carpenter, but maybe he thought gardening could be good for me. I think he saw how much I loved plants and flowers, even though he didn't like gardening himself."
21,B2,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. The strong wind from the Atlantic Ocean is very powerful. It feels like it could blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. Lawrence's sheepdog, Tie, comes to us, and Lawrence pets him gently. Even with the strong wind, Lawrence feels comfortable on his island. He is showing me around. He points to the north and shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets more rain than we do.’ I see rain clouds over Rum's big mountains. ‘Beyond Rum is the island of Soay,’ he says. Suddenly, Lawrence says he needs to move his sheep because rain is coming. We walk down the hill, and he tells me about the island. Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide. The geese eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. We stop talking to move the sheep. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to gather the sheep but is not doing well. Lawrence tells Tie to go to the right, but Tie goes straight into the sheep, causing confusion. Lawrence is disappointed and says, ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks sorry. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son, Colin, takes care of the island cottages. Their daughter, Mary, and her husband, Toby, run the island hotel, Port Mor. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail boats in the summer. ‘They leave the house and come back when they are hungry,’ Mary says. But living on the island has challenges. Electricity is only available sometimes. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, Mary makes breakfast with a flashlight. I get used to it, even without mobile phone service. Mary tells me, ‘There is mobile reception on the hill. Most people stop using their phones after a few days.’ So I do the same. Life on Muck is different. Today, a boat brings groceries and three musicians. They play music in the island’s tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, by the fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a small farm on the Isle of Soay without seeing it. Jenny went to manage it, even though she only had typing skills. I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But the food is good. Almost all of it comes from the island. Mary sends me to get fresh fish from Sandy Mathers, a fisherman. I bring it back to Mary, and by 7 pm, we have a delicious fish dinner. The next morning, I am supposed to take a ferry to another island. But many ferries have been canceled because of high waves. If my ferry doesn’t come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. Secretly, I hope it doesn’t come."
22,B2,"The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people. But now, the video games industry is taken seriously. It is not easy to get into, but it is growing. Making video games, especially those based on movies, needs many people and a lot of hard work. Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is hard to get a big job in big companies. But the industry needs more game designers. Not just the big bosses, but also people who design parts of the game.
How can you get into this industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim thinks differently. He says the best way is to make games. You need to create something to get a job. Game design is more than a job; it is a way of life. John Field, another expert, agrees but says it is more complicated. Many people want to work in games, but not many have the skills needed. You need to be creative, know technology, have vision, and be able to work on your own.
Can you do it alone? Maybe, but it is hard. A good course in game design can help. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They like all kinds of entertainment and arts. They might have worked a few years after finishing school and then decided to work in games. They are not just fans; they are interested in the future of games. Connections with people in the industry can also help you get ahead.
The idea of video games being just for young boys is old. Now, video games are for everyone. Families play together on consoles. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. Games are popular with many people and are a great way to learn. There are many opportunities in this big and growing area."
23,B2,"Since I was a child, I always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy. He always told my friend what he couldn't do. My friend stopped wanting to play football because of this. I am happy my dad was different. 
When I score a great goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but it's not. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. The best players practice a lot, even if they have natural talent. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned technique. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning skills.
At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know education is important, but I only thought about football then. The teachers were good, but I didn't notice at the time. I want my son to have a good education. We try to read him books, but he is too young to sit still. He likes to kick the books around, like me.
At the start of my football career, the manager helped young players like me join the first team. He didn't make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game, but we lost. A TV presenter said, ""You can't win anything with kids."" This made us work harder. We believed in ourselves as a team.
I rely on my close friends and family. Having a lot of money can be a problem. People say, ""I can't believe you let your mother work."" I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car. My family is strong and would not like to be on my payroll. My mum loves her job as a hairdresser, even if she doesn't earn much. I like to use my money to help people around me.
I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off. I want to do things I couldn't do before, like skiing. I can't ski now because if I break a leg, I can't play football, and I wouldn't be insured."
24,B2,"Sam Carter helped us find a place to live at Reef Point. Sam was my dad's agent in Los Angeles. My dad couldn't write anything good in Los Angeles, so Sam found us a cheap place to live. Reef Point was quiet in the summer because sea fogs made it cold. People didn't visit much because the road was bad, and a nicer place called La Carmella was nearby. Only people with no money or who loved surfing came to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, many people came, and it got busy. My dad was busy writing a script and didn't notice me much. I spent my days on the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We didn't have a dog when we moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I gave him water, and my dad didn't mind him much. Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found, like shoes or towels, which I had to return to their owners. He also liked to swim with me, even though I was faster. One day, after swimming, we watched surfers. One surfer was really good. She came over and talked to me. She asked why I didn't surf, and I said I didn't have a surfboard or money. She guessed I was British and asked about my dad. I told her he was Rufus Marsh, who wrote ""Tall as the Morning."" She was surprised and interested because she had read the book. This always happened; people were more interested when they knew about my dad's book."
25,B2,"Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on the ship called Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this advice was wrong. There was a problem with the computer system, and everyone had to wait. People were getting upset because they paid a lot for the trip and wanted it to be nice.
Violet wanted to leave, but she realized she lost her phone. This was more annoying than the long wait. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left her phone in the taxi because all her phone numbers were saved on her phone. Her son Harry always told her to be careful about this. She asked a friendly couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to look for her phone at home.
Finally, the line started moving, and Violet gave her travel papers to get on the ship. She felt disappointed when she saw the ship's entrance. It looked like a hotel that tried to be fancy but wasn't. There were shiny fake wood panels, lots of chandeliers, and carpets like those in airports. She took the elevator, which was crowded with tired people, to her room on the twelfth floor. She was happy to see her room had a balcony, just like she wanted. She had paid extra to make sure she could see the sea."
26,B2,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was finding the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 pictures by Maier, a street photographer who took interesting photos. Now, Maloof has a big collection of Maier’s work. In his home, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, plus many movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked at all of it and felt lucky. ‘When I bought this, I didn’t know what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I could have sold it all to someone else.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent her childhood in France. In 1951, she went back to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was private and always had a camera. She wore big coats, hats, and strong shoes. ‘On her day off, she had her camera and we didn’t see her until night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. She was not very social but liked to walk with her camera and talk to people, sometimes recording them. She loved taking pictures of the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anything stop her.’ Maier’s work was pure art; she didn’t do it for money. Her photos often showed women, children, old people, and the poor. ‘Vivian’s pictures are very interesting,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees other photographers’ influence in her work and wonders if she made her own style. ‘Was Vivian very skilled or did she copy others?’ Maloof wonders if he will ever see all the negatives, which he keeps in three big, safe cabinets. He wasn’t interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I learned more about photography, I saw that Maier cared about people and street scenes,’ he said. ‘There was more to her work than I thought. Now, we want people to know her name and put Vivian Maier in history books.’"
27,B2,"Eleanor Catton wrote a book called The Luminaries. It is a very successful book, and she became famous when she was still in her twenties. I talked to her in the UK when she was very busy with interviews. She was calm, even though she had just traveled from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a funny story about being stopped at passport control. They asked her to prove she was a writer, so she showed them her book. The officer asked, ""What’s it about?"" This is a hard question for a writer. 
The Luminaries is set in New Zealand in the 1860s. There are many crimes, and 12 men try to solve them. The story is very complex. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a history book, but she found the past made the story more interesting. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good part in the story.
When I asked her about being successful at a young age, she said it was nice because people in her small country, New Zealand, feel proud of her success. She said, ""I got a lot of back pats from other people’s grandmas."" She also said it is annoying when people think her book is not serious. 
Catton had an idea to write the book like a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. The book gets faster as you read. She said it doesn’t matter if readers notice this, but if they do, they can see the patterns. Even with this special structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery. She didn’t plan the whole story before writing. She liked to write herself into difficult situations and then find creative ways out. She wanted the book to be fun for readers.
We also talked about her love for TV drama series. The Luminaries has cliff-hangers and different viewpoints, like a TV show. I asked if she would like to write for TV. She said, ""That could be pretty cool."" She was very excited when talking about writing and New Zealand. She said being in different places changes her imagination. Some writers leave New Zealand to be around more people, but for now, she will stay there. I hope New Zealand gives her ideas for more books."
28,B2,"When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. These hobbies became his job for the last 40 years: he makes steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny says, ‘I love the guitar. It’s amazing how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound. Using different wood makes different sounds. It still surprises me.’
Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you want something, you make it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and wood types change the sound.’
The bass was the first instrument Jonny made, but he and his brothers had already made other things like model boats and planes. ‘We drew them and then built them. My father taught us how to use tools. I also fixed instruments for my friends.’
Jonny’s bass guitar was good, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a job. He liked painting and sculpture too. After school, he studied architecture at university because he liked design. But he left halfway through. ‘I was too different for it,’ he says. ‘But I learned that guitar-making is like sculpture. You make something people use, and it’s more practical than art.’
Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of materials. But as he became known as a great guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just getting by.’ He can only make ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings.
In the early years, Jonny worked hard to become known. He went to music festivals and asked musicians to try his guitars and talk about him. He also learned how to price his guitars, which was hard for him.
Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought only American guitars were good,’ he says. ‘But now UK-made guitars are respected.’ Jonny says learning in a classroom is good, and new makers should take courses. But he also believes in learning by trying things. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you learn from someone else, you learn one way. If you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’"
29,B2,"When English people talk, they often start with the weather. This is a tradition. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This was true 200 years ago and is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they find it interesting. But this is not true. The weather in England is not very exciting. There are no big storms or tornadoes. Some people, like the writer Bill Bryson, say the English weather is boring. Others, like broadcaster Jeremy Paxman, say it is interesting because it is always changing. But both are missing the point. English people talk about the weather to start conversations. It is a way to say hello or to fill a silence. When someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" they are not really asking about the weather. They are just starting a conversation. This is like how monkeys groom each other to be friendly. English people use weather talk in three ways: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or to fill a silence. This is why it seems like they talk about the weather a lot. But really, it is just a way to be polite and talk to each other."
30,B2,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to tell her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built, but Alice felt her answers were not good enough. She couldn't find a good historical novel about life at the Wall, so she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started writing books in 2001. She said teaching was like acting and very tiring, but writing was exciting and less exhausting. Her old teaching friends were jealous because she still connected with children through her books. Alice wants her books to be different from other children's books, which are often about dark or fantasy stories. She likes to teach English and History together and loves when children go from being bored to interested. Writing is like teaching for her. She started writing her first novel when her sons were leaving home and her head teacher suggested a creative writing course. At first, she didn't want to do it, but she had to send a story to join the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. The course students liked her story and told her to publish it. Alice asked for a year off from teaching to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helped her edit the book. He is a critic and editor, and his help was important. Alice says they work well together because he helps improve her writing."
31,B2,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. The race was between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 
‘I’m excited,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done this before. The roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I’ll stay warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. He wore winter cycling clothes, while Jonny wore jeans and a sweatshirt. Alistair joked, ‘I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he’ll make it. I might stop for tea halfway.’
The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Fleet Moss, the highest road in Yorkshire, 350 meters up. The car might have an easy time, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill at the start. After a quick handshake, they began. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside, while Jonny drove on the road. They would see each other again at the finish line. Who would get there first?
Jonny’s confidence dropped quickly. Just 15 seconds into the drive, a big tractor blocked the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he said to the cameraman in his car. ‘If Alistair wins, it’s because of this farmer!’ After the tractor moved, Jonny continued driving. Alistair struggled with the hill and had to carry his bike over fences. Sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top and started going faster.
Jonny faced more problems. The roads were narrow and not made for speed. He had to drive slowly through a village and a stream on the road. Once past the village, he raced to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. Jonny sped to Fleet Moss, while Alistair rode across a field and onto the road from the other side. Alistair reached the finish line first. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the crowd. ‘No? Really?’ He celebrated with his arms up. Minutes later, Jonny arrived. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said sadly. ‘I’m disappointed.’"
32,B2,"'When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the first thing you notice is the silence. You bounce the ball on the soft grass; you serve it and hear the sound of your own shot. The grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the quiet crowd make you feel like you are in a different world. The silence helps me focus on my game. I try to think only about the match and the point I am playing. When a point is over, the silence breaks with applause and cheers. I hear them, but they feel far away. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me or the millions around the world. I am focused on playing Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me it was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I would play there and win. Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer twice. In 2006, I was just happy to be there, but in 2007, losing was very hard. I knew I could have played better. I cried a lot after that loss. My uncle Toni, who is usually very tough, told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I told him he didn’t understand, that it might have been my last chance. I know a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I missed a big one in 2007. But Toni was right. I had another chance in 2008. I was sure I learned from my loss the year before. I believed I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we didn’t talk about the match. They knew I was already thinking about it in my mind. Until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone.'"
33,B2,"'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in April 1957. She wrote to her family, saying, ""I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa. She became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made Jane famous with articles and TV shows about her work with chimpanzees. She also wrote books for children and adults, including the popular book ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. Some people think her fame hides her real achievements. Many stories about her life focus on her adventures and dreams but do not show her true work. Jane Goodall helped us understand chimpanzees better. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. We also did not know that they have emotions and social systems like humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is very important for chimpanzee research. Jane studied wild apes in Gombe, Nigeria, and her work is considered a great scientific achievement. She changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves. Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. When she was five years old, she disappeared one day. The police and her family searched for her. She came back with straw in her hair and clothes. She had been hiding in a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity was the start of her career as a biologist.'"
34,B2,"Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist. She can speak like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are known from children's TV shows, cartoons, and health and safety videos. Shirley says that doing voiceovers is more than just funny voices. You have to make the script come alive for people who can't see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they often don't get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.
Shirley studied drama and wanted to be a regular actor. She sang jingles for TV ads and once tried out for a rabbit in a cartoon. She got the part and realized she could do voices. In her second film, she played the main character and her brother and mother. Female actors often do voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter. Shirley learns new voices by watching children's TV.
Shirley does many types of voiceover work, from cartoons to vacuum cleaner ads. She says it's important to sound happy, even if you don't care about the product. Smiling while talking helps make your voice sound cheerful. Animation work is fun because she interacts with other actors.
The competition for voiceover work is tough. A good showreel, which is a recording of what you can do, is important. Shirley says you need to be determined and not give up. She suggests going to workshops to learn about voiceovers. Shirley loves voices and sometimes keeps speaking in a character's voice even after work. Her children are used to her talking in different voices."
35,B2,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because being a cartoonist is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people stop dreaming about these jobs and think about more realistic ones, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make money by drawing doodles like the ones in school notebooks. But some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. 
For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school papers, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college. After college, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that needed political cartoons. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to live on.
To be a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree, much money, or even to be great at drawing. You need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But it’s not easy. It’s a hard job, and you should only do it if you can’t imagine doing anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family and hobbies.
The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t say no to work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about everything.
What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But now, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to make and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than those who are very artistic but not good at business.
Some people worry that others will steal their ideas, even if they have never sold a cartoon. They don’t let others see their work. To protect your work, you just need to draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,B2,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a nice, black guitar made in Japan. I usually don't like to throw things away, so why did I want to get rid of it? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, ""Are you really going to throw that away?"" I said yes, but I already felt a little sad. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways. After that, I often felt sad about what I did.
A few months ago, I got an email that surprised me. It was from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes and sells guitars. He said, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address sticker on the back of the guitar. He used my name to find me online and contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He offered to sell the guitar back to me. I was so happy I almost cried. Keith's price was fair, and I was glad to pay it. I had forgotten that my dad liked to put name-and-address stickers on everything, even my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this story!
My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s because it was popular then. I liked the sound of the classical guitar because it was calming and gentle. But I didn't get very good at it, so I switched to the electric guitar. At that time, punk music was popular, and you didn't have to play very well to be a rock star. When I got my old guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. The guitar felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I picked it up and felt like I needed to stand up to play it. My fingers remembered how to play the chords, even though I couldn't draw them. My fingers hurt a little from pressing the strings, but it felt good.
The electric guitar is not usually played alone, so I think I need to start a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call our band ""The Regainers""!"
37,B2,"There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote a book about people who can't sleep well, I felt like I was the only one talking about how bad it is not to get enough sleep. Not sleeping enough affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is getting more attention now. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them. We often lose dreams when we wake up early. The last part of sleep, called REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement', is when we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen in REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years dreaming. When people don't get enough REM sleep, they have more intense dreams the next night. This shows that dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep, and many agreed with Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. But it wasn't that simple. Later studies showed that dreams come from physical, not just psychological, origins. Now, there is not much agreement among dream researchers. Dreams are important. At a meeting, a study showed that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams more than other people. This is because they are interested in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with dreams because films are like dreams. But I wonder, do only artistic people need dreams? Everyone, like teachers and software designers, needs to think creatively. Dreams help us connect ideas in new ways. For example, when people wake up from REM sleep and are asked to think of a word, their answers are more original. This is what creativity is. I write better after intense dreams. Even a dream I can barely remember helps me think better. Creativity is not just for artists. We all need to think creatively in our complex world. We need to dream to help us with our relationships and work."
38,B2,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, you can see the sea and photos of her two daughters, but no paintings. Susie is a famous copyist artist. She can paint like famous artists from the past, such as Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her paintings look so real that even art experts can be fooled. The original paintings are worth millions, but Susie's copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. 
Susie has many clients, including galleries and private collectors. Some collectors pretend her copies are the real thing. One famous person likes to show off his 'Van Gogh' painting, which is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. Some people use her copies to save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank. Susie always signs her name on the back of her paintings. She knows it is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and she does not want to get into trouble. 
Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She did not earn much money, but it helped her learn to draw accurately. Now, she advises young artists to learn to draw well and study hard. Susie can copy many styles, but she likes French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas the most. 
Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie says it is not. The impressionists painted quickly but carefully, and it is hard to do both. Susie does not paint her own original art because she enjoys copying and makes a good living from it. She once tried painting fishing nets, but they looked like photos. Susie is a perfectionist and likes to do things perfectly."
39,B2,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and wanted to be the fastest sailor. From a young age, she was very interested in sailing. When she was on her boat, she felt like it was part of her. On land, she felt life was not as exciting, and she wanted to go back to the sea. After she finished second in a big solo race around the world, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. She lived there for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, like how much kitchen paper she needed. She showed me her food, stove, and medical supplies. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.
Later, Ellen went to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. She helped with a bird survey and saw old whaling stations. This made her think about how we use the Earth's resources. She realized we need to change how we use things like coal, oil, and gas because they are running out. She started talking about re-using things and visited factories and power stations to learn more. She wants to help save the planet.
Ellen started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to teach young people about a sustainable future. She misses the adventure of sailing but feels her new work is more important. She wants to use her voice to make a difference. She says this work is more meaningful than being the fastest sailor."
40,B2,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he could become very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan wants to inspire them to go outside and try new things. Jordan's team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty years old. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.
Some experienced climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say a young climber might be strong enough, but they worry if a teenager is emotionally ready. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing. The Romeros know about these opinions. Paul says, ‘I know people criticize us, but I can’t focus on that – we have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.’
I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father wants him to? Paul says, ‘This is not about me wanting to be famous because of my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later, but we decided: ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.’ When I ask Jordan why he likes the challenge, he says, ‘I just focus on reaching my goal.’
In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record challenge. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This is a problem for Jordan. People might say that trying to set records is more important than enjoying the climb, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to share his story. This means writing online, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, ‘If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.’"
41,B2,"'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I am studying music at university, but my classmates don't know much about classical music either. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't have their music. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and classical CDs sell only about 300 copies each. This is surprising for someone who loves classical music. Why is classical music less popular now? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. Classical music doesn't interest most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. Some teenagers do like classical music, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I am not a big fan of classical music. I like many types of music, but I listen to classical music only a little. Why don't teenagers like classical music? Classical music changes mood a lot, and teenagers like things fast. Experts say we can't focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, and its topics are more interesting to teenagers. In the past, families played music together at home, and concerts were the only other way to hear music. Now, we can find any music online, but we don't often choose classical. You don't hear classical music in shops. One of my teachers says more people go to classical concerts now, but not many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play in many places, but the audience is mostly older people. Teenagers often avoid things their parents like. Some say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids enjoy playing it in school orchestras. They practice a lot, but when they relax, they choose pop music.'"
42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said quietly. Her mother was getting out of the other side of the car and didn’t hear her. Bonnie didn’t mind if her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden among trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre. ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be in trouble soon anyway,"" she thought, ""so why not start now?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She was careful and respectful as she went to the horses. Bonnie liked horses. The horses were well cared for, she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony as she touched its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""You’re the best one here!"" she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, and Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" said Bonnie, petting his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you in a big competition."" His name was Maverick. She wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,"" she thought. The room with the riding equipment was unlocked. Bonnie was happy. She put a saddle on Maverick and forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed when she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said. ""I know about horses, even if I don’t know about other things."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The movement was exciting, and the wind made her cheeks glow. She felt Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,B2,"I met Cody Simpson before, and I liked how he was quietly confident. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia who has made many popular songs. How did a relaxed surfer become a famous singer? Cody says, ""I started playing guitar when I was six and writing songs at seven."" He remembers that he was swimming and surfing every day. These activities were very important to him. When he was 13, he was in high school and posted some videos online. These videos changed his life. He first posted a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. People liked it and wanted more videos. Cody made more videos at home and shared them. Many people loved them.
Cody was also a very good swimmer. He trained with top coaches and worked hard at swimming. But then music companies noticed him. He had to choose: stay in Australia and swim or move to the US for music. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was hard for me to choose a career at such a young age,"" he says. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise for many people. I'm a quiet person,"" he says. Cody and his family moved to the US, leaving one dream to follow another. His family stays out of the spotlight but supports him. Cody thinks it's important to have good people around you to stay grounded.
Sometimes Cody worries about his family, especially his little brother and sister. His brother is eight and travels a lot, doing school on the road. Cody wonders how this affects him. But his family always supports and encourages him. Success comes from saying ""yes"" to big opportunities, even if they are scary. ""Everything happened so fast,"" Cody says. ""Now, I visit countries I never thought I would and play for many fans. It's a dream for many people, but I know it won't last forever."""
44,B2,"I jumped out of bed and looked out the window at the river. There was a new crack in the ice shining in the sunlight. I looked at the sandbags we put up last week to stop the river from flooding. My back still hurt from lifting them. I worked with many people from the town to do this. My grandfather didn’t notice much. I looked at the river where the water was dark and open because of the factory. I saw a boy I didn’t know trying to walk on the ice. I put on my kayaking wetsuit and jacket. I checked my pocket for a silver chain my grandfather gave me. It’s special to me. I also have his diary from a trip to South America. I read it before I sleep. I went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex,’ Mom said. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I almost bumped into Grandpa in the hallway. ‘Watch where you’re going,’ he said. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ He knows I kayak every morning. Grandpa gets angry sometimes, but I try to ignore it. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. That hurt, but I took a deep breath. He went into the bathroom. Mom said, ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself,’ I said. I used to think he was a hero when I was a child. He has photos in National Geographic and medals in his room. I don’t go there anymore. I have my own trophies now. But I still care about him. Mom said, ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination!’ I smiled and said, ‘It’ll be warmer in South America if I get sponsors for my trip.’ She laughed. I ate my banana and went to the boathouse."
45,B2,"Mum took Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, against the wall, was a painting. It was Grandpa's work, but different from his other paintings and not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a big river, but she didn't know it. Maybe it wasn't a real river, just a fantasy one. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was small, just a little green, and the eye was drawn to the pale waters and a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this picture. But Jess was interested, thinking of autumn after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, like she was hiding her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others understand them if they could. Mum turned the picture over and showed the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would say. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without explaining it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting, since you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" ""Someone who gives an artist ideas."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint. He would say the muse wasn't kind to him today or he needed to be nice to the muse for a difficult part. He never said the muse was her. She thought it was a goddess, not a person. It was hard to think anyone, even a goddess, could influence Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,B2,"'When I woke up this morning, I did not plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I am not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet by itself. I am not saying that happened, just that it could have. I did not mean to damage the carpet. I did not wake up thinking, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. I am unlucky that way. I was not thinking about cutting holes. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is very cute! It is small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran kept china ornaments in it. I keep my shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her cabinet. I was so happy when she gave it to me! But it is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I have only two corners in my bedroom. My room is the smallest in the house, under the roof, and shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But Angela is only fifteen, so I will be in my small room for a long time. I do not mind; I like my little bedroom. It is cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a little too tall. If I could cut a few centimetres off the bottom... Then I had an idea. If I could not cut the cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box’. And that is what I was doing!'"
47,B2,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of very small people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not the humans', which made filming more difficult. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was making the shadows look right when the tiny Borrowers were shown with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special way to do this. After the show was on TV, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very strange and fun. When I asked them to carry big things like a giant pair of scissors, they really enjoyed it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh a lot. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me was getting the costumes right. I made them from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit down during breaks, and she couldn’t take the dress off because it was sewn on every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for the detailed costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t very accurate, but they worked well enough. We didn’t have money for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work fast – I once filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series showed the magic of the books well."
48,B2,"Mom stops the car at my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously for journalists, but there are none. I know the attention will come soon. People will want to be my friend or ask for free tickets to my dad's concerts. I tell Mom, ""Everything’s going to be fine."" She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. She drives away, leaving me to face this new school and new situation. I wanted this change to get away from my old life on the road. While the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I chose this school to meet real kids. Maybe kids with parents who work regular jobs. That would be so normal and cool.
I walk into the school office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not very friendly. ""Desert McGraw,"" I reply. She seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types my last name. Not many people know my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" she asks. ""Eleventh,"" I answer. ""One second, it’s printing,"" she says and gives me my schedule. English Literature is my first class. I like English, so that's good. I will be late, though. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night to find my classes easily.
When I reach the classroom, the teacher is already calling names. I quietly sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with flowers. I knew they might give me away. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher calls my name, ""Desert McGraw?"" ""Here,"" I reply. The teacher, Ms. Smigla, smiles and gives us our course outlines. After talking about the books we need to read, she lets us socialize. 
""Why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have choices. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras? Or the real reason my dad gave? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said. ""This is the perfect place to record the new album."" I think he just wants to relax on the beach. ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Everyone will find out soon, but I want to be normal for now. ""He’s an artist,"" I say. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way,"" she says, not really interested. Perfect."
49,B2,"'Today, American teenage girls are expected to do many things. They should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in everything. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Teenage boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average. Being average is not enough. People think that if you do not try very hard, you are lazy. Teenagers have a lot of pressure. They have homework, tests, activities after school, jobs, chores at home, and they also try to have a social life. Kristen Loose, a teenager, says this is normal for teenagers today. But people still think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, and only care about themselves. Kristen says this is not true. Many people think teenagers spend all their time watching TV or on their phones. Kristen says she uses her phone to help her with her life, not just for fun. Teenagers need to be connected all the time. They use smartphones and tablets to do their homework anywhere. Schoolwork and activities do not stop when school ends. Teenagers often start their day at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation says only 20% of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep. Many teenagers fall asleep in school because they are tired. Lindamarie Olsen, another teenager, says she has about 18 hours of free time a week. She does not waste this time on social media or TV. She likes to volunteer and help others. She wants to make a positive impact in her school and community. In the future, teenagers will continue to change the world and prove stereotypes wrong.'"
50,B2,"The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers from Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. They have launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a science project that is also an adventure, which is why many teenagers like it. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to try and record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and makes a light trail. 
As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside the lunch box, there was a camera, a tool to measure how high the balloon goes, and a thermometer to check temperature changes. Two GPS trackers were on the outside to help find the lunch box later. They used a gas tank to fill the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy had traveled seven hours to get the gas tank. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For these kids, this is normal. 
Finally, it was time to launch the balloon. They counted down, ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ and the balloon started to rise. Some teenagers ran and followed it with flashlights until it was out of sight. There was a quiet feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky. It was hard to believe they were just four hours from Los Angeles, a big city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor crossed the sky.
As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. The lunch box usually lands in a remote area because there is not much inhabited land around Bishop. ‘Recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader. They have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘We have learned a lot about this landscape,’ he added.
This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, especially if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. ‘These students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What seems wild to some is normal for them.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was on a flat rock in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars, which was a bit disappointing. But it was a chance to talk about atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. It was also another adventure story to share."
51,B2,"Chloe Morgan says she didn't like science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. Her younger brother loved dinosaurs, which is common for kids, but Chloe didn't care much. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new dinosaur discoveries. It amazed her, and she decided she wanted to study Palaeontology.
Chloe met her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous. She was nervous because she thought he might find her annoying with her questions. But he was patient and listened to her, which made her feel comfortable.
Chloe talks about how movies and TV shows show palaeontologists. She says films like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs but not always in Palaeontology. She thinks movies often show palaeontologists as strange geniuses or awkward people, which is not true. Her job is very different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, and writes for science magazines. She also likes to explain science to the public, especially young people, to help them understand more about science.
Chloe helped with a TV documentary called Walking with Dinosaurs. She says the people making the show knew a lot, and she only gave advice if needed. The dinosaurs in the show were very realistic and different from those in movies like Jurassic Park.
Chloe thinks dinosaurs fascinate us because they make us feel like explorers. They remind us there is still more to discover in the world. Palaeontology is like traveling back in time."
52,B2,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not ""there"" yet, even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" Once you arrive, it becomes ""here,"" not ""there."" So, you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" Parents probably want to be ""there"" more than kids do because they hear this question a lot during long trips.
Kids often complain, but think about it: you can relax in the back seat, watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the scenery passes by outside. In the front seat, your mum or dad gives you juice boxes, cookies, and changes the radio or temperature to keep you happy.
But sometimes, things go wrong. Like when my younger brother, Tim, puts his foot on my side of the seat. I do the same, and soon we are fighting. Mum or dad has to stop us and tell Tim to stay in his seat. Then, everything is calm again, and we enjoy the view.
Later, I feel a breeze on my arm. It's Tim, blowing air on me from his seat. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is not doing anything wrong. I get angry, and Tim gets in trouble again. Then, things calm down once more.
Dad has ways to handle us in the car. When we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he sometimes says, ""Yes, get out of the car."" But we are still on the highway, so we know we are not there yet. This makes us quiet for a while.
You know you are finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids. So remember, if mum and dad can still answer your question, then no, you are not there yet."

Zuzi says they started the café because people spend too much time on phones and gadgets. They want people to talk and have fun together without screens.
The games in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have simple themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources. Everyone stays involved, and no one feels left out. Later, 'co-operative' games were made, where players work together as a team. One example is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players solve global problems together.
Matt Leacock loved board games since he was a child. He was often disappointed with games, so he started making better ones with his uncle. Pandemic became very popular. It tells a story, like a video game, where players develop characters and face new challenges.
Video games have helped board games become popular. Many people now play games on their phones. Ben Hogg, who works for a games company, says more people are open to playing games now. Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many video games are played online, and players are not together physically. So, some people want to play games with others in person again.
John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun. In our online world, people like to share games in real life, and this trend will continue."
54,B2,"Jamie Scott is a famous music writer and producer from the UK. His story shows why it is important to keep trying in the music business, even if things don't go well at first. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. At home, he only listened to a radio station for older people, which influenced his music taste. He first heard a modern song when he was 12 years old. Around that time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he was very good at, and music. He spent his school lunchtimes playing the piano. Jamie decided he didn't want to play tennis forever because it was too hard. At 17, he left school to become a musician. He was in a music duo with a friend, but his friend didn't want to make music a career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to be a musician and had been writing songs during school. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he got a music deal at 19 because of one song. But the labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he left his friend. Jamie became successful behind the scenes, writing songs for others. He changed record labels to release a new album, but it didn't make him famous. Jamie says he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time as an artist, but as a writer, he was in the right place. He is now a top writer in the UK, helping new artists start their careers. Jamie believes writing songs that can be popular is important. He wants to write big hits that many people will listen to. Jamie is honest about wanting to write number one songs and knows he is good at it. He focuses on writing the best music and creating classic modern pop songs."
55,B2,"Tony Connor is a new kind of famous person. He is very popular online, but many people who do not watch online videos might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist.' This means he does tricks on a bike, like jumping from a roof to a wall. These tricks are filmed and shared online.
I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many local boys knew him, and even older people came to say he is a 'legend.' After watching his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each trick, Tony explained what he wanted to do, and I was not always sure he could do it. But he did, and when I praised him, he seemed not very interested. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans and prefers doing tricks instead of talking about them.
Tony's fame comes from social media and new camera technology. This technology helps him make a living from his videos. He says, 'This technology gives people like me a chance to earn money.' But he also feels that people spend too much time with cameras and screens. Still, he is happy because he can make money from what used to be just a hobby.
I have learned that to become a top athlete, you need energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent. In risky sports, you need mental strength. Even Tony sometimes falls when trying new tricks, but he gets up and tries again until he succeeds.
Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some people say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people do not understand his sport. They do not know he gets advice from experts to stay safe. Tony is careful about risks. He says, 'Some people never get scared, but they should be careful. I feel fear but find a way to overcome it. I am not addicted to risk. I plan and prepare a lot. Sometimes I ride around to get ready before a new trick. I know I must be confident before I jump. If I am fully committed, I am okay.'"
56,B1,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous things for charity. She ran a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she knew some circus skills, she found high-wire walking very different. ‘The training was a surprise,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know I needed to be so strong. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then, I did an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also learned how to fall on the wire so I could continue if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she walked step by step on the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said after. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ But Helen is still planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,B1,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing. A penny farthing is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Before this, Jeff wrote a book about traveling in Canada in a very old car. He loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even went to Amsterdam on it for a holiday. ‘That trip made me want to see the world by bike,’ he says. Jeff didn’t want a normal bike, and he wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bike I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to learn how to make one.’ He tried to start his trip in 2001 and 2003, but he had to stop because of a knee injury. Finally, in 2006, he started his journey. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was seeing Mount Everest in Tibet. ‘I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which I couldn’t do, but I never regretted my penny farthing. The further I traveled, the more people were amazed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in a hostel bed for ten days without medicine. He had no money for hospital bills or to go home. But Jeff says, ‘if I had the money, I would travel again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,B1,"I work at a university in the US. My team and I study water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see the ducks at night. We are worried about black ducks because there are fewer of them now. We don't know if they have enough food on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night. Before, we didn't have the right tools to see them at night. But now, with the new scope, we can see them clearly, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and take better care of the places where they live. 
The work is hard. There are four people on our team, and each of us works six hours every day. We study ducks in different places. I have to take a boat to some places and write down notes about every duck I see. The weather is not always good. Some nights are nice, but many nights are rainy. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. 
I like the challenge of this work. In the summer, we will spend many hours in a laboratory looking at our results. It will be hard to stay inside, but it is important to do this. I wouldn't change my job for anything!"
59,B1,"'When I tell people about my job, they can't believe it. But it's true! I work by eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is important to make sure customers get the best chocolate from my company. Every week, I get small pieces of chocolate from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the nuts, fruit, and other things we use in the chocolate. I spend time choosing the best ones. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I test and taste the chocolate I make. I give samples to my coworkers, and they like it! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients. It's nice to have a private space to work. Every day is different in this job. Sometimes I am in our food lab, and other times I travel to buy ingredients. I have a young family, so traveling can be hard. But I like the variety and not having a routine. I love the chocolate most of all! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, and I still love eating it. I even eat more chocolate at home in the evening!'"
60,B1,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which is flying through the air above an audience. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can watch some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia says that for a circus career, performers need to do different things to keep shows exciting. To be successful in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have imagination, and always try to get better. People often think you might get hurt or only work a little each year. But the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel with the circus when you're young, and then you need to think about other jobs. The course also teaches business planning. Many past students have started businesses around the world and like to share their stories. Sophia warns that it's not a job for making a lot of money! ""The work usually means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive - but a lot of fun!"""
61,B1,"'You might not know her name or her face, but you have probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She helps the main singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers. That is not true – they have to be very good. People like Mariam are important in the music world! ‘What I love about my job is that when I go to the recording studio, I never know what I will sing,’ she says. ‘It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little song for a radio station or an advertisement. I am often surprised by what producers ask. One time, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue, I just do the job!’ ‘Excellent musical skills are important for my work, and I need to learn quickly. There is often no written music to look at. I will never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very hard because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared: I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.’ ‘One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers do not always know which musical range is best for the female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can find out how to make it better.’"
62,B1,"Julie Deane started with only a little fashion knowledge. She made a successful business with her 'satchels', which are traditional school bags. These bags are now sold in famous shops and many celebrities use them. Before choosing satchels, Julie thought about different businesses like cake decorating and party planning. She did not choose her first idea. When she decided on satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She worked with her family from the start, especially her mother, who is good at business. The design of the bags came from children's storybooks. Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her a lot. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To get more interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and more people became interested. Now, her company makes satchels faster. Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity is using a satchel. Other companies spend money on online ads, but Julie uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles. This keeps her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design. Now, she makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. People say her office has a positive feeling, and everyone loves working there. There is a new factory now, and while buildings are important, it is the team that makes it special."
63,B1,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork.
When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special bike for racing and started joining competitions. Vicky thought it looked fun and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily go to training after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. But when she was 28, she stopped competing. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning, but I got tired of it. When it’s not exciting anymore, there’s no point. Luckily, I found a new job.’
Vicky started working for a charity called CycleZone. ‘We help young people who don’t like sports,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves. CycleZone does a great job and brings young people together.’
The charity uses famous people to talk about their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people think celebrities only help to make themselves look good, and this can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,B1,"Ana Ronson is a singer and songwriter from Ireland. Her parents were not musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert. 
A year later, Ana's brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She liked it so much that she joined a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Ana was the youngest student, but she knew a lot about music. However, the teacher did not listen to her ideas, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about how this made her feel. She put the song online, and it became very popular. People left comments saying they loved it and found new meanings in the words each time they listened.
Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, came from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know the company and did not want anyone to tell her what to sing. But Joss convinced her this would not happen. Soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. All the tickets sold quickly, and it was a great evening.
Ana says she likes to write songs about difficult times because there is more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him unhappy. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,B1,"Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat with a group along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t. I wanted to visit the area because I saw it on TV when I was a child. Our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. I asked Harry if I could go too, and he finally said yes! A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather was going to be calm when we were there. I was busy at work, so I didn’t have much time to plan. But Harry said he took care of everything, so I stopped worrying. When we got to Canada, we joined the group, put our things in small boats, and started the trip. The guide said not many people lived along the coast. On the first morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands far away, but it was foggy, so we couldn’t see them well. I watched the nice patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped to explore rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish that I didn’t know. It was nice not to worry about time. We always made lunch and dinner together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it was a stress-free life! When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I also wanted to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,B1,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think I would love basketball because of this, but I didn't. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often took a book to read instead of watching the games. 
When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I played my first game against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it went well in the end!
For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't like being far from my parents at first. At home, I didn't have much time with friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. I got used to my new life, and my English got better quickly!
I became a professional basketball player at eighteen, three years after moving to the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,B1,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and found out that I really liked it. I saw my city in a new way, like the tourists did. After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed to know a lot more. In Chicago, guides must answer many questions about the city, like its buildings, history, and transport. After some hard but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping the group together. You need to be fun and tell good stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy the tour, not hear about problems. I make sure my visitors are happy, so they don’t write bad reviews online. Good reviews bring more customers. I work hard to make my tours fun and easy, and my reviews are usually very good. Many people recommend my tours to other visitors in Chicago."
68,B1,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. But in the end, we did not need to worry.
One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants!
The part of the day I liked most was the evening. We walked with the elephants into the forest where they stayed at night. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so it was small. We chose this because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we knew it would be like that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff talked and played games.
Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I am not sure she is being honest. I think she is a bit upset because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy her time there fully. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"
69,B1,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many people, not just for friends or homes. Hotels and offices like to have flowers in their Reception areas. Sometimes, we help with photo sessions for businesses by giving them flowers for their pictures. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very happy with what we did.
My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping then, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark, but I don’t mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. There are so many colors and smells, it is hard to choose. If I chose for myself, I would pick only pink flowers because it is my favorite color. But I have to remember that other people might like different flowers. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I cannot find what customers want.
I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower-sellers, but it is part of the job. Flowers are not cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and put flowers in vases. Then we make flower bunches and decide how much they will cost. Customers are often surprised by the price, and I sometimes ask them to choose again. Some people think this is too much work, but I enjoy making the best flower bunches for the money people want to spend. I love my job and wouldn’t want to do anything else!"
70,B1,"'My city has a modern cinema that shows all the new films I want to see. It also shows many films for kids on the weekends. The cinema is close to my home. But a year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about films with people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema to show films. Instead, we choose a new place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the film feel real and exciting! Some places are free because the owners sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own equipment. We also sell tickets online, so we know how many people are coming. There is always a lot to do, but when people say they had a great time, it feels wonderful. Our website helps us connect with other film clubs in the country. We visit them to see how they do things, but we love coming back to our club. We also started a blog because people look online for film information now. We tried putting posters in cafés, but people telling their friends about us works best. The audience loves the special activities we do with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz, and everyone enjoyed it.'"
71,B1,"When I was a child, I loved taking photos. When I was 15, I wanted to make my hobby more serious. So, I started a special project: I would take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to other people. I was happy to see that some people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone told me that my project would be better if all my photos had a common topic. I agreed and started taking more photos of nature, like birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different because most young photographers took color photos. Sometimes, I felt unsure about my project and almost stopped. But I trusted myself and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos for fun. I was so happy when the judges said I won first prize. It was the first time I thought my photography was really good, and maybe I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I am happy with my career choice."
72,B1,"Last year, I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because they do camping, sailing, and teach skills like public speaking. I had never done these things before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called 'leaders' help you. When you finish each level, you get a certificate.
When I first joined, my leader said I should help organize activities at a local children's club for two hours a week. I wasn't sure it was a good idea because I went to that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate.
Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children's club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I made good relationships with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to it.
Because of what I learned at the children's club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a youth worker, someone who works with children. I never thought about this before starting at the club. I had never thought about my future job, and the idea of youth work was new to me. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,B1,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and had not thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. In the end, I did well. After that, I started to love snowboarding and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people get bored of snowboarding, but I still love it and like winning. This helps me try harder. I like not having a fixed plan. Once, I got a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I was not sure I would try the jumps, but I did, and it made me trust myself more. In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I do not have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend time with my friends. It helps me when I cannot snowboard. I think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I want to have another option in case I do not become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I can find time for college. I cannot imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I cannot do it forever."
74,B1,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't think about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. This taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't like it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it was hard, but it was easier than I expected. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they liked them, but I thought they were just being nice. I wanted to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists come to my town, and they bought my jewellery as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at the market stall! That's when I knew it could work, and I decided to make a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun."
75,B1,"When Janine Stuart was only 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is a little bit about Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, ""Because of my dad’s job, my family moved a lot, so I got good at making new friends. I know how it feels to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, starting at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s life at home, especially with her older brother. I don’t have brothers or sisters, so I used my imagination for that."" Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mom always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers always told her to write, so it was a good way for Janine to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story competition on a website for young writers. Because of this, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were excited to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the story is about people facing hard problems, which makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than some other popular authors. Janine is still getting used to being famous: ""At first, I hid when people saw me on the street, but now it’s OK. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just spend time with my friends, and then I have something interesting to write about!"""
76,B1,"Hi, I'm Tom. I'm fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father got a job as the castle's manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and lets people visit them. He was happy because he thought he might not get another chance like this. At first, we were not sure if Dad should take the job. We were thinking about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as nice as our home across the water, and there was no school on the island. But after we moved, we got used to living there. The castle is not very pretty, but our apartment is nice. In summer, the island is busy with visitors, and there are parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families on the island, and there are not many teenagers. The adults help each other with fixing things, which is hard work. The biggest change for me was taking a boat to my old school every day. I was excited to go on stormy days with big waves, but the boats don't go then! If I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I miss the last boat home, which is a problem. So when friends come to stay with me, I tell them to hurry up! But we see amazing views, like the sunset over the sea. Some days, it's so foggy you can't see anything, then it's sunny again in a few hours. It's still surprising when that happens. We do have bad storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle is strong enough. But then I remember it's been here for hundreds of years, and it's still standing!"
77,B1,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I love nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural home. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They taught me how to tell different birds apart and where to find them. It was amazing! After we came home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species. I am close to reaching this goal because on family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird species there. I didn’t see it, but I learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about my challenge. Many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fun hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I wasn’t nervous until just before I started speaking. I knew what to say and had notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I relaxed when it was over. The teachers said I did well and they enjoyed it. I might do another one next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,B1,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and soon I became a good player. My family thought I would stop playing football like I did with other hobbies, but I didn’t. I dreamed of playing football professionally when I grew up. 
One day, I played in a local tournament, and a referee saw that I was a good player. He told the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. The manager liked how I played and asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. I started training with the club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at playing football. 
Some people didn’t think I would become a star player, and that made me a little sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in a big match earlier than I thought I would. I ran very hard because I didn’t want the team to lose because of me. Luckily, I scored the winning goal. I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals.
Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. We want to get teenagers interested in football and let them talk to other players in my club. They will see what it’s like to play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them is the same as my coach’s advice to me: you will have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I have been lucky to have very few bad times!"
79,C2,"In the UK and other countries, schools and universities are now encouraging students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research skills are useful in school and at work because they help us think about the world and do our jobs better. As a student, you help create new knowledge by asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? These questions are part of what we call research.
Research can be very complex and done by experts, but it can also be simple and part of everyday life. For example, when you plan a holiday, grow plants, fix things at home, or shop online, you are doing research. In college, you are expected to ask questions, explore information, and create your own ideas. Some students find this hard because, in some places, knowledge is seen as something you get from teachers and books without questioning it. But in the UK, US, and many other places, it is important to question what we know and who tells us what to know.
Critical thinking is very important in research. We should not just repeat what we read or hear. We need to think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense and is supported by evidence. We should not just believe everything we are told without thinking about it carefully."
80,C2,"Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art in cafés. But living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso moved to the countryside later. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.
Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains. They found that cities can make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients get better faster when they can see trees. Even a small view of nature helps our brains because it gives us a break from city life.
More people now live in cities than ever before. We live in crowded places with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a busy city street, our brain has to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and the city layout. This takes a lot of energy because the brain has to decide what to focus on.
Nature, on the other hand, is easier for our brains. This idea is called attention restoration theory. It says that being in nature helps our brains relax and recharge. Natural places catch our attention without making us feel stressed, unlike loud city noises.
People have known for a long time that cities can be hard on our minds. That's why we have parks like Central Park in New York. Parks give people a break from city life and help our brains work better. Many things, like energy drinks or new office designs, try to help us think better, but a walk in nature is often more effective.
Even though city life can be hard, cities keep growing. They are still places where people come up with new ideas. Research shows that the busy and crowded parts of cities help people be creative. Just like in old London, today's busy cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of new ideas and technology.
The challenge is to find ways to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. Because sometimes, people still want to say, ""I'm tired of nature, take me to the city!"""
81,C2,"'Where is the mind? This might seem like a strange question. We usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have special machines that can show this. But I believe the study of the mind should not stop at the head. There is a lot of evidence, from long ago to now, that things outside our heads also help us think. For example, stone tools, jewelry, and writing have helped humans grow and think better. So, I think that what is outside the head can also be part of the mind. 
We often think the mind and the brain are the same because scientists study people without the things around them. This is because brain machines need it that way. But much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I do not say the brain is not important, but the mind is more than just the brain. Human intelligence also includes culture and the things we use. 
I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET looks at how things become part of our thinking. For example, when we use clay to make numbers or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how this has changed over time and what it means for our thinking. This gives us a new way to understand the mind.
Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self start? The stick and the person work together. The stick helps the person feel the world, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. This shows that human intelligence can change a lot by using new tools. 
My idea sees the human mind as always changing and growing. The 'stick' can be anything from old stone tools to the internet. It helps us understand and explore the world. Humans use 'sticks' to learn and know more. This is why humans make things, and these things help shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds change as we use different things. 
MET helps us understand how things like stone tools or smartphones change how we think. Technology changes our minds, and humans have used it since the beginning.'"
82,C1,"Photography has changed how we see the world. In the United States, it became a big part of culture. Photography is important in many areas like science, industry, art, and entertainment. Some people say it is the US's biggest gift to the visual arts. To understand its impact, we need to look at its start in the mid-19th century.
Why did people like photography so much? First, it was a new technology, and people in the US liked new things. Just like trains and electricity made the world feel smaller, photography brought images of the world into people's homes. Second, people used cameras to show who they were. In the US, people often changed their personal and national identities. Third, cameras helped families keep memories, even if they were a bit idealized. Lastly, photographs looked real and matched the US artists' style of showing everyday life.
A photograph shows what the photographer wants us to see. It is a record of what was in front of the camera. But it also shows the photographer's point of view. People think photography is a 'universal language,' but its meaning can be complex. A photograph's meaning can change depending on where and how we see it, like in a newspaper or a gallery.
To understand a photograph, we need to know why it was taken and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things at different times and places. Today, artists use photographs in their work. Since Andy Warhol, artists have mixed photos with paintings. Photography is now an important part of art, not separate from it."
83,C1,"In 1890, William James, an American thinker and doctor, called psychology the ""science of mental life."" This idea is still useful today. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we have some idea of what this means. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is mostly about humans. James thought human psychology had basic parts: thoughts and feelings, the world around us, and how we know about these things. Our understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences. Sometimes, we think we know why people act a certain way, like feeling sad or quitting a job. But people can see things differently. Psychology tries to find out which explanations are correct. It helps us know the difference between our own ideas and scientific facts. 
Psychologists study the mind and brain, but they don't know everything about how the brain works. They learn more by watching how people behave and making guesses about what happens inside us. Studying psychology is hard because we can't see the mind like we can see an engine. We have to guess what is happening by looking at behavior. Psychology is like solving a puzzle. It uses clues from careful watching and measuring. Psychologists want to describe, understand, predict, and change things they study. This helps us understand our experiences and improve our lives. Psychology has helped in many areas, like teaching children to read better, making machines safer, and helping people talk about their feelings.
People have talked about psychology for a long time, but it has been studied scientifically for only about 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means thinking about their own thoughts, to find answers. But this method has limits. William James said trying to understand the mind this way is like trying to see in the dark by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to study what they can see, like how people behave, instead of just thinking about their own experiences."
84,C1,"In a simple building in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy, like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, thinks each product has a sad story about the people who made and sold it. 
The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who used to work in marketing, wanted to collect a library of new products. He began buying one of every new product he found starting in the 1960s. He did not plan to collect failed products, but most new products do not succeed. So, his collection became mostly products that failed.
Many people today are very optimistic, which might be why these products were made. People in meetings might not have realized the products would fail. Even if they did, they might have spent more money trying to sell them to save face. People often do not talk about why a product failed.
In the self-help world, people often use ""positive visualization,"" which means imagining things going well. Some scientists, like Tali Sharot, say our brains are made to think things will go better than they might. This can help us survive, but it might not always help us succeed.
Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that thinking too much about success can make people less motivated to reach their goals. For example, people who imagined having a great week at work often did less.
Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, says how we think about ability affects how we handle failure. Some people think ability is fixed and cannot change. They find failure very upsetting. Others believe ability can grow with effort and see failure as a chance to learn. Dweck says this second way of thinking is better for happiness, even if it does not always lead to success."
85,C1,"Sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know, but sports are changing a lot. Two things are making us question the old ideas about home advantage: science and money. 
Sports scientists want to know what helps players do their best. They have many ideas about home advantage. People who pay the players want to know if home advantage still matters. They think if players get enough money, they should play well anywhere.
Fans are important too. For example, if Manchester United played some home games in Asia, British fans might not like it. They think their team needs their support. Fans often believe that when they cheer, their team scores. But they forget the times when cheering did not help.
One thing that seems true is that home fans can affect the referee. In an experiment, referees watched a game with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees might avoid making the home crowd angry.
Studies show that home advantage is less now than before, but it still exists. In the 1890s, home teams in England won 70% of the time, now it's 60%. Travel is easier now, and stadiums are more similar, but home advantage is still a mystery.
Home advantage is different in each sport. It is strongest in basketball and football, but weakest in baseball. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball needs teamwork. Playing at home might make teams feel more confident.
Another reason for home advantage could be players' feelings. Before home games, players have higher testosterone levels, which might make them more aggressive. This was seen in the Rugby World Cup, where home teams won against stronger teams. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,C1,"""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports. It means that practice makes you better, not really luckier. This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate: is talent something you are born with, or can you learn it? Many people believe practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said you can become an expert in anything with 10,000 hours of practice. This idea is in books like Outliers and Talent Is Overrated. They say practice is the most important thing. But David Epstein, in his book, says it is not always true. He shows that sometimes natural talent is also important. Epstein looks at why some people are very good at what they do. He travels to places like Kenya and Alaska to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that sled dogs' success might be because of their natural drive, not just training. This suggests that determination might also be genetic. Epstein talks about nature (what you are born with) and nurture (what you learn). He says both are important for top athletes. He also thinks about race and gender in sports. He asks why men and women compete separately if only practice matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the best."""
87,C1,"A recent report says many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her book, Kith, she says it's because children spend too much time indoors, watching TV or using computers, and not enough time outside in nature. She thinks this is the main problem. 
A study talked to children and found they would be happier if they could play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their childhoods fondly, saying they had more freedom to play outside. They think this was healthier than how children live now. But these adults are the ones who keep their own children inside because they worry about safety.
Griffiths talks about how parents' fear of danger helps toy and gadget companies sell more products to keep kids busy indoors. She also mentions how some people give medicine to children who are restless or make them wear goggles for playground games. She thinks these rules are silly.
Griffiths believes children should have freedom to explore and take risks. She says children need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. But she doesn't explain how to make sure these accidents are small. She also wonders if all children want to be adventurous. Some children might prefer to stay at home and be quiet. Maybe the real problem is forcing all children to be the same, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,C1,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of school. Most problems in life cannot be solved with formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My research focuses on how play helps children grow. All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that need to learn more, play more. For example, animals that hunt play more than those that eat plants. Primates, like monkeys, play more than other animals because they need to learn more. Children play the most because they have the most to learn. Play is how children learn important skills for life. These skills cannot be taught in school. They are learned through play. Skills like thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling emotions are important. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can solve new problems and ask new questions. Creative people think playfully. Geniuses keep their playful minds as they grow up. Albert Einstein said school almost made him lose interest in math and physics, but he found it again after school. He called his work 'combinatorial play'. He imagined chasing a sunbeam to develop his ideas. We cannot teach creativity, but we can stop it by focusing only on school questions. More important than creativity is getting along with others and working together. Children are born wanting to play with others. Through play, they learn social skills and fairness. Play is voluntary, meaning players can stop anytime. To keep playing, everyone must be happy. This makes play very fair. School has become harder: less break time, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced free play. 'Play dates' with adults watching have replaced unsupervised play. Adults now feel they must solve children's problems. These changes have happened slowly but are big. They are caused by parents' fears, experts' warnings, less close neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children need more play, not more school. If we care about our children and the future, we must change this trend. We must let children play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for the future."
89,C1,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them talk directly to employers. In the past, people had to do things like stand outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign to get noticed. But using social media can also lead to mistakes. 
For example, a young person in the US tried to connect with a marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts. The young person thought these contacts could help him get a job. But the executive was not happy. She did not want to share her contacts with someone she did not know. She sent a very rude message back, which many people saw online. People were shocked by her message. 
This story shows that using social media for jobs can be tricky. Many young people do not know how to use it correctly. Social media has been a big part of their lives for fun, but using it for work is different. When we were teenagers, social media was a place to have fun and be someone else. But for work, we need to be serious and professional. 
Employers often say young people seem too friendly or confident on professional sites. This can make older people think young people feel they deserve everything. But many young people are just trying hard to find jobs. They have skills and want to work. 
So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, say who you are and why you are contacting them. Offer to help them with something, like research. This can make them more likely to reply. Do not send the same message to many people, and be polite. Social media can help you find good contacts, but you need to use it carefully."
90,C1,"'It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Some people think newspapers will disappear. Since 2000, many UK newspapers have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think newspapers will be gone in 15 years. But old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here. Theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and TV. Radio is still popular even with TV, and cinema is still here despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again. Newspapers were once new too. They became popular in the 19th century because of new technology like the steam press and telegraph. People started to want news regularly. In medieval times, people did not expect change. They only noticed the seasons and big events like floods or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. Before that, people did not need news every day. Newspapers have a set format, but online news is different. Online, people can choose what news they want to read. They can get updates quickly and see full documents. Online news can be confusing because everyone wants to be first with the news. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand the world better.'"
91,C1,"'If humans were comfortable in the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy walking in the dark. The night would be as clear to us as it is to many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This is a basic part of who we are, even if we don't often think about it. This is why we have changed the night by adding light to it. We have filled the night with light, like how we control a river with a dam. This has good and bad effects, called light pollution. Scientists are just starting to study these effects. Light pollution happens because of bad lighting design. It lets light go up into the sky instead of down where it is needed. This makes the night less dark and changes the natural light patterns that many living things, including us, are used to. When artificial light enters the natural world, it affects things like migration, reproduction, and feeding. In the past, the idea of 'light pollution' would not make sense. Imagine walking to London on a moonlit night around 1800. It was the biggest city in the world then, with nearly a million people. They used candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no streetlights yet. From a few miles away, you would smell London before you saw its dim light. We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but it is not. Many animals are active at night. Light is a strong force and attracts many animals. Birds, for example, can be drawn to bright lights and fly around them until they are exhausted. Birds migrating at night can crash into tall, brightly lit buildings. Some birds sing at night when there is artificial light. People once thought light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Most of us don't need a clear night sky for work, but we do need darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can cause health problems. The regular cycle of day and night is important for our bodies. Changing this cycle is like changing our balance. In the end, we are affected by light pollution just like animals near bright lights. We have lost touch with the natural night sky and the rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our place in the universe and the beauty of a starry night.'"
92,C1,"The owner of a big international company said his company will not count how many days off employees take. This idea came from another internet company that did the same thing. The owner got the idea from an email from his daughter. Some people think this email was just a way to make the decision look friendly. 
But is this idea good? The internet company has 2,000 workers and does one type of work. The big company has 50,000 workers and does many different things like finance, transport, and healthcare. In a small company, workers know each other's work better, so they can decide if taking time off will hurt the business. 
The owner of the big company said workers can take as much time off as they want if they are sure their work is done and it won't hurt the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? When you take a holiday, work piles up. This can make people feel guilty and stressed, which can make them work less well over time. 
There might also be pressure from other workers about who takes time off and when. In many companies, people work late, and this could lead to a culture where no one takes holidays, even if they can. If people feel they can't take time off because they might look lazy, they might not take the leave they need. 
Modern technology means we can get work messages anytime, anywhere. The internet company started the unlimited leave policy because workers asked how this new way of working fits with old time-off rules. But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Workers might feel like they are always being watched, which can be stressful. 
Employment laws give workers a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for health. The good things like more happiness, creativity, and productivity that come from unlimited leave can happen without this policy. So, I am not sure if letting workers take as much holiday as they want is really what the company wants or if it will work."
93,C1,"'Journal-based peer review is a process where experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This is to make sure the research is good and not wrong. It can take up to a year to review a paper. Some people think this is important to make sure the research is trustworthy. Others think it takes too long. 
Now, there is a new way called preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed. This helps share new research quickly so others can read and discuss it. Publishing in journals is often about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can lead to problems. Sometimes, scientists leave out important data to get published in top journals. Reviewers also focus more on whether a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good science.
Preprints can help solve these problems. They allow everyone to see and discuss the research openly. Some people worry that without peer review, bad science will be published, but this has not happened yet. Preprints let authors get feedback from many people around the world. 
Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience. She posted a preprint to critique another paper. This was better than using journals because everyone could see the discussion. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments are still available online.
Preprints also help share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals. More people read and cite papers on preprint archives, showing they are a good way to share research. Preprints focus on the research itself, not just where it is published.'"
94,C1,"'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is like a ""painting in words."" Their answers do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked them to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist and another from the object's point of view, called ""Poem."" One student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class see how poetry is different from anything else. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. When I was in school, poetry was confusing to me. I thought poems were puzzles that stopped me from understanding and feeling. After school, many people lose interest in poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like normal writing. It dares you to read it, but often it is disappointing or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we want from poems? Are they for deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever thoughts? Maybe. But for tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings are nice to look at, and music is a mix of words and sounds. But poems can be unclear, like life. This does not explain what a poem is. If you search online for ""poem,"" it says ""poetry"" is a type of art using language's beauty and rhythm. This is complex, but the word ""poem"" comes from Greek, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things."" So, what kind of thing is a poem? Poets say poems are like wild animals or machines, but these ideas do not fully explain poems. The best part of comparing poems is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or an animal, it can change how you think about them. It helps us see things differently. Poems can stick in our minds, like song lyrics. Words and music are powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. But aren't words sometimes like sticks and stones? A poem in a newspaper or magazine can have a strong impact, even though it is just ink on paper. Poems have empty space around them, which could be used for more writing or ads. A poem is made by writing and rewriting, like stories or articles, but it is not made to be sold. Publishers send out poetry books, but they do not expect to make money. A poem is not for the market; it is for itself. Because of this, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment.'"
95,B2,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I have found many brooches and coins, and each one makes me happy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 
One rainy February afternoon, I had some free time and decided to go to a place I knew. It mostly had old farming tools. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I almost ignored it but decided to check. I dug half a meter down and saw a round, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, like curtain rails I found before, so I didn't get too excited. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, patterned loop. I stopped and stared. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. 
I took it to my car and drove home, looking at it the whole way. At home, I washed it in the sink. I called Marion and showed her. She was surprised. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At night, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it, so I later hid it under a floorboard in my office.
The law says I had to report the find within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before giving it up, so I even showed it to a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The registrar was surprised when he saw it. The torc was checked and sold to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the field owner and me. But the torc is more than just money. I saved it for the nation. People ask if I will stop detecting now, but I still enjoy finding brooches and coins. It's like fishing; you never stop hoping for a bigger catch."
96,B2,"'Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a little guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy trips with lots of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I smile and listen. What would they think if they knew that I like to have free time for naps in the afternoon or lazy mornings in bed? Sleeping better is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept – more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Far from home, I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes easier. I think sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see and hear new things. We take in new cultures, music, and places. We process all this when we sleep, which is why travel sleep feels different. Sleep also changes with different places. People talk about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local habits is harder. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. When I finally do, I feel like I belong there. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all felt sleepy and lay down on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows. I joined them and experienced the siesta, a traditional nap. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds when I sleep in a new place. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should stop feeling bad and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too.'"
97,B2,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said kindly to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little hat will make me stand out."" She touched the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this is the one I want."" Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, Tattie. Mia's husband, Jeff, had asked, ""What kind of name is Tattie?"" Mia said, ""It's short for Tatiana. I think it’s nice."" Jeff didn’t like fancy things and always spoke his mind. He would have told the woman in the shop that she chose the wrong hat. He often told Mia, ""You’re too polite."" An hour later, Mia closed her shop and went home. Her shop was next to their house, so it only took forty seconds to get home. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia had the idea to turn the barn next to their house into a shop. Jeff was unsure. ""Do you think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew they did because her friends often said it was hard to find the perfect hat. She was right. After Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats became popular. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. They could try on many hats in a friendly place. Mia also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."
98,B2,"Lawrence Okoye is from London, and he has moved to Atlanta in the USA. He is on an exciting sports journey. Lawrence used to throw the discus in the Olympics, but now he wants to try American football. He has never played American football before, but he might join a big team in the USA. In Atlanta, he is learning what he needs to do in his new position. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London might play for a top American football team. Lawrence is good at surprising people. He was going to study law at Oxford University, but he decided to focus on discus instead. In less than two years, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence went to Atlanta to train for discus in warm weather. He wanted to get ready for the world championships. When asked if he really wants to try for an NFL contract, Lawrence says, ""Yes."" He thought about American football when he was in school in London, but it seemed like a crazy idea. After arriving in America, he read about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. He applied online and was not nervous about competing with experienced players. Lawrence is confident in his abilities. His test results were very good, and he was chosen as the best player. He was happy to hear that. Lawrence knows he has a lot to learn, but coaches say he has what it takes. He is not worried about being selected for a team. He is relaxed because there is no pressure on him. People think he will be chosen, but he is not too concerned. Lawrence had a tough time at the Olympics when he came last in the discus final. But he is happy he made it to the final with a great last throw. He says it was an amazing day, even if the final did not go well. After the Olympics, some people thought he was upset, but Lawrence does not talk about it. NFL players earn a lot of money, over $400,000 a year, so it is a good opportunity. Lawrence has tried rugby, athletics, and now American football. Some people think he should focus on one sport, but Lawrence says he is following his dreams. If American football does not work out, he can go back to discus, which he loves. He says all his decisions are well thought out."
99,B2,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daytime. I looked out of the window and saw the empty land below. The dark colors of brown and green made me feel better. It was mid-September, but it had not started snowing in Siberia yet. I saw no people, just mountains, streams, and forests going on forever. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to a far place to sell safety clothes to the local mining industries. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. But with a dictionary, I told him I was flying to the city of Magadan in far-eastern Siberia. I had only a one-way ticket because I wanted to go back to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it now. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and said one word, ""Holodna"" (cold), pointing outside. I tried to show him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes. I did not tell him that I was on a tight budget because I paid for the trip myself. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I was not sure they would work well. This was true for my big postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students sitting in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer kept talking. I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I wrote a note, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" Al, my old school friend, was sitting in front of me. I tapped him on the shoulder and gave him the note. He read it, scratched his head, wrote something, and gave it back. I opened it and read, ""OK."" Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. I was still learning how to manage my classes, but the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling. Plus, there were long holidays to go on adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. After our bike ride through Pakistan, Al wanted more adventures. He decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since our first ride, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest challenge so far. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would be too hard. Even though it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, finding out he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the people who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,B2,"'In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns to fly through tall pylons, which are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to see what it feels like to be in the race. An hour before the flight, I signed two forms. The first said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small things can be dangerous during the flight. I learned I had to stay focused. 'The horizon is your best friend,' they told me. The pilot would tell me where to look. I also promised to relax when flying upside down and try to enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. They told me not to touch anything. When we were on the runway, my legs were up, and I tried not to touch the pedals or switches. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. In high-speed flying, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense and relax at the right times. Panicking is bad. This was not comforting as we started down the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we quickly turned right. It was a strong move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach high up and my lungs tight. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, flying between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn't done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I flew the plane. My hand shook, and the plane shook too. Then Dario said something. I asked him to repeat, but he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. 'Are you okay?' 'Yes.' 'Have you had enough?' 'No,' I lied. Then he did a loop, flying in a full circle. Some people find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a voice saying, 'Relax, look up.' I looked up and saw fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was 'soft' compared to what pilots do in races. To show this, Dario ate sandwiches happily after we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night I dreamed of doing loops again and again.'"
101,B2,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature documentary, he probably filmed them. He likes it when the temperature is -18C. Allan studied to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew and realized he loved being a wildlife cameraman because it had travel, adventure, and underwater filming. Now, he is a top cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife series. 
When he started, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. Allan became the ""cold man"" because he filmed in cold places. The camera technology was very simple 35 years ago. It is easier to film today because of digital technology. Before, film was expensive, and you had to remember what you filmed. Now, you can film a lot and see it right away. 
Allan is good at filming in cold places because he has a lot of experience. He feels comfortable on sea ice, like crossing the street. He does get cold toes, but there are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes in the poles. Wildlife filming has successes and failures. Once, he went to the Orkneys to film birds called kittiwakes but could not tell which birds they were. 
Recently, Allan got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. It is a place with polar bears and is very hard to visit. It is usually -32C in April, and the wind is strong. Carrying cameras in the deep snow is very difficult. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens for 23 days, Allan saw only one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, he felt like he was living in the bears' world. 
He found a new hole and waited. After five hours, he saw a brief glimpse of a bear. The camera was ready, and he saw a black nose, then a head, and soon the bear was out of the hole. She looked at him but was not worried. Then she slid down the slope, and two cubs appeared. It was their first view of the world. Allan says it was like a show, and they had front-row seats.
Now, Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and see the effects of climate change. He believes he can make an amazing documentary."
102,B2,"In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies. He had to swim in very cold water and face frostbite and polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic for a new and even bigger challenge. Pen and two friends will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole in three months. They will measure the ice to see how thick and dense it is. No one has done this before, and the information will be very important for scientists. This will show what global warming is doing to the ice.
Pen was trained for this job. When he was a child, a woman who worked for a famous explorer took care of him. She made him go outside in the cold with little clothing to make him tough. His father loved cold adventures, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps with his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he is driving at home than when he is in the Arctic. Mary once raced against him in a mountain event, and she finished an hour before him.
Pen and Mary have two children. Pen says it is harder to leave them this time. When he left before, he told his son to take care of the family, which was too much for him. So, this time, Pen will not talk to them much while he is away. He is getting ready for the trip and making sure everything is perfect because fixing things on the ice is very hard.
Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer, will join him. A team of six will fly in supplies. Pen says being in a team is more stressful for him. He is also worried because he is turning 47 and has not trained as much as he wanted. He thinks his mission is important because it will help scientists understand the Arctic. He believes their skills are now very useful for society."
103,B2,"I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being an Olympian is amazing. I had time to write, work on TV, and talk to businesses and schools. These activities were fun, but I missed competition. I wanted to stay fit in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. But I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's question: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to my rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. If I joined, I would want to win. Would Ben help me win? Probably not. But being the underdog sounded fun. I contacted Ben. He was already planning to race and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. The race was possible, but it was expensive. The boat and equipment cost £70,000. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money after sports. People are interested, but I wanted a new goal. Doing the race meant I could talk about something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. Being a full-time athlete was hard, but simple. I trained every day, and there were doctors and dieticians to help. I worried people would think I just wanted to be on TV with Ben. But during our preparations, I realized the race was more about the mind than rowing. Ben had done tough challenges before, but he couldn't row well. I was surprised by this, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,B2,"'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in the north of Finland. I was 26 and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, quiet places, different from noisy London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They let me work as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow. The rides can last from one hour to five days. They started with six dogs, but now have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm’. It is a simple place with no running water and sometimes no electricity. They said I could join them for three months if I understood the work was hard and the hours were long. I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I looked at pictures of more than 100 huskies. I needed to learn their names, but I felt nervous. I stopped looking at the pictures and looked out the window. People say spring moves north at about 26 km per day, with flowers and leaves opening. But I saw winter moving south, with rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north was what I hoped for. We drove through dark forests with snow-covered trees, stopping sometimes for reindeer. I arrived at the farm after dark and was given boots to go outside. 'Do you want to start right away?’ Anna asked. It was not really a question. I followed the barking to the dogsheds. Three people were getting the huskies ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited and wanted to run. I could not hear well to introduce myself, and the others were too busy to talk. I stood on the side and petted a quiet dog. Someone told me to get in a sled, and soon we were off into the dark with only a headlight. November 15, Hetta It did not take long to become a husky guide, but first, Anna asked if I was useful. I did not know. I had never driven a snowmobile, done woodwork since school, or chopped with an axe. 'Do you have a driving licence?’ someone asked. I nodded, feeling better. The basics of dog-sledding are easy to learn: lean into corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But other things are hard. Feeding and watering the dogs is difficult in the cold. Water freezes quickly, so we make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I was tired from pulling sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I was happy. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I emailed friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,B2,"On that day, when Radcliffe ran past the finish line, many reporters came to talk about her amazing run. Her time was so good that she could have competed in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Reporters asked her about a special natural treatment called emu oil. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had told her about it to help heal her injuries from an accident when she hit a bike while training. Radcliffe says she didn't really understand how big her achievement was at the time. She felt it was just what she was supposed to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits.
During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep running so fast. Hartmann was upset by this because he knew how fit she was. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast and still finished the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the end, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would beat that time soon. Radcliffe thought she would try again next year, but it didn't happen.
After the race, people wanted to know how she, with her unusual running style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her for weeks, helping her with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said she could handle a lot of pain. He would work so hard on her muscles that he had to ice his thumbs afterward. Hartmann traveled 13 hours from Ireland to her training place in France. When he arrived, her husband said, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for a break; she wanted a two-hour session right away. She worked very hard, and that made her great. Hartmann spent so much time with her that other athletes were unhappy.
Radcliffe doesn't know why no one has beaten her record. She trained very hard, but she thinks others might be more talented. She thought Mary Keitany might do it. Radcliffe believes people are racing each other instead of pushing themselves. She always pushed herself, even when she was winning. That marathon was the best race of her career. She never ran that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,B2,"When my first cooking show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" started, I didn't know how people would like it. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food ""revolution"" in Britain. I thought our show was new and different, but I was worried. Would people like a cooking show that talked about techniques, history, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to many other interesting projects, like a book about my restaurant experiences. Each project felt like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote several books called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. These journeys were often real trips with passports and suitcases. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest book, where you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best pasta. These people have spent years trying to make perfect food. Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But after a long meeting, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on emotions, memories, and surroundings. I knew the recipes in the book were not the only way to make these dishes. But I thought I could use my skills and knowledge to find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says ""perfection"" means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV series let me explore new foods, people, and places. I was excited to learn about memory and nostalgia in food because that's how I started in this business. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. Some adventures included visiting a tomato factory that used the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that wasn't good enough to film. I tried different techniques for each recipe, like hand-milking a cow to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down to make a pizza."
107,B2,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field. It stopped suddenly. John got out and looked at the engine. He stood there for a long time, looking like he knew what he was doing. But then he said, ""Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,"" and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried and said, ""We can’t stay here forever."" The field was big, with grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was safe to be on her side. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. John went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass and asked me to tell a story. Bea lay next to her, and I told them about hearing two birds talking in London. They talked about breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. They even argued about a worm. Bea said, ""That’s silly, no one understands bird language."" I felt upset and said, ""I do,"" but I didn’t sound sure. ""Liar,"" Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? I asked Mum, but she was asleep. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped push the van to a hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out, but the boys smiled and waved at her. We went into a café near the road. John whispered, ""It’s a hotel. It might be expensive."" Mum said, ""We’ll just have some tea,"" and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum said, ""It’s like syrup."" We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. ""It’s a miracle it got us this far,"" he said when it got dark. Mum made a bed for us outside in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. John said, ""I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech."" Later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John driving. Bea didn’t want to move, so John carried her to the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we’d get home since our van needed to be towed. I thought maybe we could take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,B2,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel. She was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe. Lucy didn't hear the girl's name well because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke good English. They talked about the music they were playing and their travels.
Lucy told them she might go to the Tanglewood festival in the summer. It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She often did things like concerts and competitions that took her around the world. She missed so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. Lucy didn't even want to come to the Prague Festival. Her mom had applied for her without telling her. Lucy's dad bought her a necklace to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus dreamed of going to the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for dinner to plan her music pieces.
The guy from Tokyo asked Lucy how old she was. She said she was fifteen. He looked surprised. Lucy didn't mean to show off. She just wanted to fit in. The girl, Liesel or Louisa, left to talk to someone else. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked if Lucy had been to Japan. She said she went once when she was eight. Then, Lucy's grandfather came and took her to meet other people at the party. He told her not to get too friendly with the competition. Lucy said they weren't the competition, but her grandfather said everyone is the competition.
After the party, in the elevator, her grandfather told her she did well and that people knew who she was. Lucy liked being somebody important, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care about her music skills. But at the festival, Lucy felt like she mattered."
109,B2,"""‘You spend too much time online. You need to go out more,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I wanted to see what experts say. It’s interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, feel they belong, and learn important tech skills. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers live in it, not just use it like adults do. It’s not good or bad – it depends on how you use it. Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says it’s like hanging out at a youth club, like parents did when they were young. It helps teenagers find out who they are and deal with teenage problems. Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says social media helps teenagers ask, ‘Who am I?’ You can share your favorite music or sports and learn about different views. Research shows social media users are not as self-centered as those who don’t use it. It can help shy people because it’s easier to talk online than face-to-face. Professor Andrew Phillips studies young people using social media. He says it helps quiet people with special interests find others like them. If you like a rare type of music, you can find a group online and feel less alone. Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online and create content are using social media well. They make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers learn and share. This helps with jobs because businesses use social media to sell and promote. If you have 1000 friends on social media, they can be your customers. Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they work. Matthews agrees that working with others online is a key skill for jobs today."""
110,B2,"'When most people think of a family vacation, they don't usually think of a long trip through nine western states in the US and a part of Canada. But my parents wanted something different for our summer vacation this year. My dad planned a big family trip. He said, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" and my twin brother and I were not sure it was a good idea. In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With the car full, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" We left our big home for smaller places to stay for the next five thousand miles. We drove west through Oklahoma. Even close to home, we had adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma under very dark, starry skies, but only after a dust storm almost blew us off the road. We learned that cows have the right-of-way on the road! The next day, we got up early and started driving again. The desert turned into mountains. Each day was different. We walked in the Great Sand Dunes and went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The town smelled like sulfur, which was a hint of what we would see later. We learned that some roads are only for Jeeps. Everywhere we went, we saw a mix of old and new things. We got used to traffic because of road work. We laughed when we saw ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We saw many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park. There, we watched the sun set near bear habitats. Traffic would stop to let bears cross the road, and we had a close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger. As we traveled, we forgot about home. Even the old hotel we stayed in, with no internet or phone service, didn't bother us. The views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we drove back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to a faraway place to see something special. It was nice to be home again, and I didn't fight with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our trip to look at. I knew I would remember the unplanned and fun moments the most.'"
111,B2,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school and live at the college. She had a nice room with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would still check on Amy.
Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a little about her grandmother from holidays. She never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose’s parents were not very happy, but Daisy wanted to know her granddaughter again. Rose didn’t know why her parents didn’t like her grandma, but they had a problem in the past. Rose was ten years old when she last saw her grandma, but she had happy memories.
Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy liked to meet people and was very social. Rose would soon have dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady. Daisy went to many social events.
Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, or go out without asking every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to make good decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were problems, they would talk about it.
Rose was not a wild child. Her school friends were like her, so her school reports and exam results were good. In five weeks, Rose would start a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth school in five years, so she was used to it. This was the last time because she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new start in her life."
112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to think she might write a book. Charlotte thought writing a book was a big challenge, but she wanted to try it. When she was 13, she decided to start writing. Now, her book is about to be published. She told her old teacher, who was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't want to wait because she thought she could be good at it.
I met Charlotte in her publisher's office. Even though I knew she was 15, I was surprised to see a teenager. Her book is very good, with a strong story and lots of action. It doesn't seem like it was written by someone so young. A public relations person was with us, but Charlotte didn't need any help. She is confident and smart but not too confident.
Charlotte knows she is young and doesn't have all the answers. She says she wanted to ask big questions in her book, not answer them. She is interested in the idea of taking responsibility. Charlotte thinks many books for teenagers show them in three ways: as outsiders, as naïve, or as awkward. She didn't like this because she thinks not all teenagers are like that. She believes these stories can make teenagers doubt themselves.
Charlotte loves reading fantasy books, but they almost stopped her from writing. She thought she had to write about deep things to be good. She liked a book called How Not to Write a Novel because it taught her about keeping readers interested.
Some people might think Charlotte's parents, who are journalists, helped her get her book published. Her dad knew someone in publishing, which helped her book get read. Charlotte knows she was lucky, but she also believes that writers succeed because of their talent. She says every writer needs support and a bit of luck, but after that, it's up to them."
113,B2,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew into the air, but something was wrong. We watched closely. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t ready for freestyle skiing. On other skiing holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it. My parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing centre in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes. After practising inside, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers just hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part before the slope goes down again. Land in the right place, and you keep moving. Land on the flat, and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to stop, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but I felt shorter by midday. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises were like ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth talked to us. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work. Every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then I was in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more problems before I finally landed right. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But it didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I didn’t slow down before the jump, landed in the right place, but then saw my skis sliding down the slope without me."""
114,B2,"'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath as it starts to go up slowly. There is a pause. Then, the rollercoaster drops quickly, and you feel your stomach lift. You move fast, turn left, and go upside down. Everything is a blur, and you scream from fear. But you chose to be there, like many people who visit theme parks every year. Amusement parks are a big business. They have exciting rides to attract people. Behind these rides, there are many people working. There are engineers and designers who make sure the rides are fun and safe. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' sounds like a dream job for a child. But it is a hard job. Designers must make rides that are fun and a little scary, but not dangerous. They also need to make new things to keep people coming back. Many think rollercoasters are getting more intense, but most ideas used today were made by John Miller, a designer from the early 20th century. Back then, rides were more extreme, but now designers must follow rules. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts said it is about making people feel like they are being thrown around but still safe. The best rides tell a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and have new features like the tallest or fastest ride. Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trying new things are important. Jeff Hornick, a theme park director, said designers need to love thrills to understand what people want and to test rides before they open. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said not to expect big changes soon. Virtual reality can add to the ride, but the real rollercoaster experience will still be the most important for many years.'"
115,B2,"Miranda Ellington is 25 years old and has done a lot as a choreographer. She makes dances for many theatres and dance companies. Sometimes, she still dances herself. She says dancing helps her remember what it feels like to follow orders from choreographers, which can be hard and stressful. As a choreographer, she teaches and likes working with young students. New dancers are open to trying new things and want to succeed, even if they don't know their strengths and weaknesses yet. They listen to feedback, even if it's tough, and sometimes they give her honest feedback too.
When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on dance steps and lets the music guide her. Even if she doesn't like a piece of music, she tries to create the best dance for it. If dancers don't like the music, it can be frustrating, but she has to find solutions without changing the music. She wishes she could try different music to make rehearsals more fun, but she often works on big shows where the music is already chosen.
Miranda doesn't want to work with just one theatre or school. She likes meeting new people and learning different styles. This means she has to change how she works each time she goes somewhere new, which helps her stay flexible.
Recently, there was a documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda thinks it shows the real life of a dance company. She remembers a scene where a young dancer keeps getting corrections but can't get it right. It shows how hard ballet is and how much work it takes.
I asked Miranda what makes a great dance show. She says it's when everything – music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Even if everything isn't perfect, aiming high is important. Sometimes, good dance steps can be ruined by bad costumes or props.
Miranda has done many different types of work. People often want to label her as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist, but she doesn't like that. She wants to try many things and not just focus on one area. For now, she wants to explore and learn more."
116,B1,"'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on TV. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to see and do? This conversation gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and used old seatbelts to hold it. I put my bags on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I have walked on many trips before, but this was different. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I like to say how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can see the film on my website.'"
117,B1,"When I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I usually travel with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. At the Greek port, the man was surprised when I asked for one ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I told him I would join ten other people to swim around the islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and let me on the ferry. Our group had sent emails before the trip, but we didn't have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us a support boat would be with us, and they showed us how to talk to it. We did a short swim to divide into speed groups, then we started our first 1.5 km swim. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swam in a river, but never in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group, not where I wanted to be. I watched the faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first swim, and I was happy when I did it by myself. The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to look at the scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and enjoyed them more. We didn't need the support boat much. I can't wait to come again next year."
118,B1,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but I love it. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and life is always exciting. This job is perfect for a young person like me!
When I was a child, I went to a school in another country, away from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers. Some of them let me help. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and try something new.
At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people. Many of them, like me, were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and past work experience, not just that I loved to travel. I got the job!
I recommend this job to anyone. There are many good things about it, but free flights are not the best part. Airline staff work very hard, and we have a saying: ""No one is finished until everyone is finished."" We are like a big family. Even if we don't see each other all the time, we are still close.
When I am not working, I don't have to think about work. If I have difficult passengers, which does not happen often, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!"
119,B1,"'At the summer camp where I work, I like seeing the children do things they never thought they could do. Most children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after we encourage them, they try and reach the top. This makes them feel very happy. Some children miss home at the start of the week. It's not the very young ones who miss home the most – it's usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's too late now, do it tomorrow. Most children feel okay after a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time. Sometimes, it's not just the children who feel lonely. Some parents call a lot, asking how their child is doing, which is not needed. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing something else, so we tell the parents to call back later. We often see a certain type of child come, usually wearing expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why.'"
120,B1,"'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors also play music. It started in London last year after being in the USA for five years. In the USA, it was voted ‘Best Musical’ four times! In the UK, it was hard to do the show with only British actors. In the UK, young actors can do fewer shows each week than in the USA. So, they needed more actors in the UK. The director found many talented actors in the UK, and they won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it is full every night. People want to hear the songs that were popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me the young actors are busy. ‘We have school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ His class came to see the show. The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and it made Jamie feel confident. His parents come when they can, but it is expensive for them. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found another guitar and asked me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was happy when I got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! The young actors were already musicians, and some played many instruments, but they had never played in a band before. They found it easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first played together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is worth seeing.'"
