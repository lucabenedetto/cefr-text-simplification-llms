1,C2,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—when you announce your location online. The website's message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing too much online can have negative effects. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost. 
This might sound discouraging, but don't lose hope. There is guidance from early internet users who explored these challenges before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, faced job losses, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of online fame. They have already experienced what many of us are going through now. It's worth learning from their experiences because, as the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, attracting readers with his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was open: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While his work was very personal, it also had a certain artistic quality.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He explained that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is appealing, but if you expect it to make people like you, you might be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned to manage what she shares online. Armstrong's experience teaches us that while the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we don't understand. Most scientists agree with this idea because no one claims to know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it anything from ""atrocious"" to ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.
At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film talked about how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film mentioned discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher supposedly showed that the shape of a water molecule could be changed by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing because it is simple and clear. However, scientists usually respond with skepticism, saying, ""Give me a break."" They believe that while the idea is amazing, there needs to be solid proof that it is real. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough.
The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. Recent discoveries show that the universe is indeed stranger than we thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy.""
Other discoveries are equally amazing. Neuroscientists found that our conscious perception of events is about half a second behind reality, but our brains edit this delay out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.
Science is far from complete. In fact, we seem further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some of the world's top theoretical physicists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people believe the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"Writing novels is a challenge for me, while writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. Writing each type might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch between them. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers liked seeing this other side of me. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revising can take longer). It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You can finish a short story quickly and move on. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I'll make it through. So, writing short stories is a nice change of pace. Another good thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, a word, or an image. It's often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don't have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn't work, you can just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. This is comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in your next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories' successes and failures. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like soft shadows I've left in the world, faint footprints. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,C2,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is clear to experts, but its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and they often ignore or exaggerate its mistakes.
Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced by new ones, similar to how new music styles are first mocked but later accepted. Scientists often disagree, and emotions like jealousy and anger are common. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. We will admire these ideas but also question them, recognizing both human creativity and limitations.
Science is always changing. Scientists constantly challenge each other's ideas. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned this view, showing that observing the universe can change it and that we don't fully understand basic concepts. Some people see this as a weakness of science, but scientific changes often improve our understanding and ability to predict nature. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing.
At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, relativity, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe. Maybe.
Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have gone from observing nature to controlling it, sometimes upsetting its balance without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the world their children will live in and even the children themselves. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. Deciding how to use science is not just for philosophers; it affects national budgets, health, and the future of life on Earth."
5,C2,"Around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed book. Despite evidence that digital and print books can coexist, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea continues to spark our imagination and debate. Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about new technologies and change.
Historically, whenever new technologies appear, people predict the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear. However, radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and workplaces. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. In 1894, some thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, television, and smartphones, all supposedly threatening print books. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks.
The idea of the book's death often appears during technological changes. This reflects our hopes and fears about new technology. We form emotional connections with media like books, TVs, and computers, making them a core part of our lives. Studies show we even name our cars or get frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it changes our relationship with familiar things. This can make us nostalgic for what we used to have, leading to industries focused on retro products. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people sought original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have made people appreciate the physical quality of old books, even their smell.
This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power and our resistance to change. We often use familiar story patterns, like tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the book's death reflects our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves."
6,C2,"For a year and a half, almost every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest minds from the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, showing them as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you nap afterward."" In this way, my book is about the conditions for creativity, not the creative work itself. It’s about the process, not the meaning. 
The book is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even writing a business letter reveals something about your inner self. My book explores questions I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to dedicate a small part of each day to it? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time, as my dad always says, ""work smarter, not harder""? I don’t claim to answer these questions, as some may not have clear answers and might be resolved only through personal compromises. However, I have tried to show how various successful people have dealt with similar challenges. I wanted to illustrate how big creative ideas are built through small daily efforts and how working habits affect the work itself.
The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine might seem ordinary and thoughtless, like being on autopilot. But with the right approach, a routine can help you make the most of limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can guide your mental energy and help you avoid being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and couldn’t stick to a regular schedule. 
Interestingly, it was procrastination that led to this book. One Sunday, I was alone at the architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a morning person, focused in the early hours but not very productive after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for other writers’ work schedules. I found them easily and they were entertaining. I thought someone should collect these stories, so I started the Daily Routines blog that afternoon, which eventually led to this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine profiles, and obituaries. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the original’s brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
79,C2,"One of the most interesting changes in higher education in the UK and around the world is encouraging students to start doing research early in their studies. This idea is based on the belief that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists making big discoveries. Instead, research is a natural and important way to learn and develop skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your job because they help you think about the world and how you work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You don't just learn and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? Why does it matter? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.
Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is the complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts that leads to big changes and new knowledge. On the other end, research can be everyday inquiries with a solid plan, involving careful work and asking thoughtful questions about issues, practices, and events. Most students have been doing some form of research since school or work, asking questions that lead to investigations. You have been developing research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, choosing a music system, or shopping online.
In college and higher education, having a curious mind, identifying problems, critically exploring information, and creating your own responses and knowledge are expected. Some students might find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and learning means listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and authorities. However, in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process might seem daunting, but critical thinking is crucial in research. The research of others is valuable, but we need to do more than just repeat it. We should engage with it, think about it, test it, and see if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should not blindly accept information from others without questioning it."
80,C2,"Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.
Scientists are now studying how living in a city affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. We have known for a long time that city life is tiring, but new research shows that it can also make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for our brains. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a quick look at nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from the busy city life.
This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into crowded areas with many strangers. These unnatural surroundings can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. When you walk down a busy street, your brain has to keep track of many things: distracted people, dangerous crossings, and the confusing city layout. This constant need to focus drains our mental energy because the brain has to decide what to pay attention to and what to ignore.
Natural environments, on the other hand, don't require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can refresh our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.
Even before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York offer people a break from urban life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people try many things to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or changing office layouts, simply walking in nature seems to be one of the best solutions.
Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Why do they remain centers of intellectual life, even in the digital age? Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that make us lose focus, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The ""concentration of social interactions"" is a big reason for urban creativity. Just as crowded 18th-century London led to new ideas, crowded 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a hub for technology and creativity. Less crowded cities might produce less innovation over time.
The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. After all, there are times when people say, ""I'm tired of nature, take me to the city!"""
81,C2,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious to say that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain-scanning technology to support this idea. However, I believe we shouldn't limit the study of the mind to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in how we think. Archaeology shows that things like stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and shaping our minds. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might still be part of the mind.
It's easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their usual surroundings. This approach makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limitations of brain-scanning machines. But it often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny that the brain is crucial for thinking, but I believe the mind is more than just the brain. We should explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world.
This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking process, like when we use clay to make numbers or a stone to make a tool. It also studies how these interactions have changed over time and what they mean for our thinking. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of what objects do for the mind.
Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does this person's sense of self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be continuous. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: the stick helps the blind person turn touch into sight, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence is adaptable and can change by incorporating new technologies.
I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, from early stone tools to the internet, tools have served as pathways for humans to explore and understand the world, not as barriers. Unlike a monkey using a stick to get food, humans use tools to satisfy our curiosity. This unique human trait explains why we create things and how these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world.
I want to include material objects in our understanding of the mind. MET offers a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern smartphones, have helped define and transform who we are and how we think. While ""mind-changing technology"" might sound futuristic, humans have been using it since we first evolved."
