1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—when you announce your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet, that you're not at home. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing too much online can have negative effects. The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can get lost. 

This might sound discouraging, but don't lose hope. There is guidance from early internet users who explored these challenges before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, experienced the ups and downs of online life. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the challenges of being in the public eye. We can learn from their experiences. 

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. At that time, the web was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In 1996, he started a daily blog, attracting readers with his bold approach. Hall shared everything, and anyone who crossed his path could end up on his site. This was the work of an exhibitionist, but it also had artistic value. 

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called Dark Night. He explained that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including those she had criticized, and she lost her job. This situation is known as the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned to manage what she shares online. Armstrong's experience teaches us that while the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we don't understand. Most scientists agree with this idea because no one claims to know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it anything from ""atrocious"" to ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem intriguing. 

At first, the film seemed harmless, with scientists saying that new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher supposedly showed that the shape of a water molecule could be changed by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Many people find this evidence convincing because it is simple and clear. However, scientists usually respond with skepticism, saying, ""Give me a break."" 

The idea that thoughts can affect water is amazing and could mean new forces are at work in the universe. But we need solid proof that this effect is real, and pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. 

Recent discoveries show that the universe is indeed stranger than we thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" On a more practical level, neuroscientists have found that our conscious perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this delay out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.

Science is far from complete. In fact, we seem further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some of the world's top theoretical physicists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people believe the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,"In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is enjoyable. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. Writing these two forms might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. After starting my career with two short novels in 1975, I began writing short stories from 1984 to 1985. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers liked seeing this different side of me. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my beginning as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to get a short story into decent shape, though revisions can be endless. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That's it. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I'll make it through. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace for me. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small things – an idea, a word, an image, anything. It's often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don't have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn't work out, you just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't create masterpieces every time. This is comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like soft shadows I've set out in the world, faint footprints I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,"Science can be both very theoretical, like philosophy, and very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats to our existence. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles to fully grasp these concepts. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is often only seen by experts, its dangers are misunderstood, and its importance is both overestimated and underestimated. People often ignore its mistakes or exaggerate them. 

The journey to explain the universe has been full of conflict. Old theories are often changed or completely overturned, much like how new music styles are initially mocked but later become popular. The fight between old and new ideas is rarely graceful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. The history of science is marked by conflict. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book will focus on the ideas themselves. We will admire their beauty and creativity but also question them, recognizing both human ingenuity and limitations.

Science is always changing. Scientists are constantly disproving each other's ideas. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they lead to major shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics challenged this view, suggesting that observing the universe changes it and that we don't fully understand our basic concepts. Some people see the changing nature of science as a weakness, but it usually leads to better understanding and prediction of nature. Isaac Newton could explain more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein more than Newton. Science often makes mistakes but continues to progress.

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing significant left to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, the electron, the nucleus, hundreds of new particles, quantum mechanics, relativity, antimatter, dark matter, black holes, chaos theory, the Big Bang, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe. Maybe. 

Science is not just an intellectual hobby. In the last two centuries, we have gone from observing nature to controlling it, sometimes upsetting the natural balance without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists can no longer ignore scientific advances, as they will shape the world their children will live in and the kind of children they will have. Science is now part of how humanity plans and shapes its future. Deciding how to shape the future is not just for philosophers; these decisions can impact national budgets, the health of future generations, and even the survival of life on Earth."
5,"Starting around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. An anonymous publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investment decisions, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed book. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books keeps coming up. Whether people are predicting or dismissing this idea, the thought of books disappearing continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium replacing another often follows the introduction of new technologies. Even before digital technologies, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and on factory floors. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some believed the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the death of the book often appears during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our hopes and fears about technological change. To understand why these reactions are common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we develop close bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it doesn't just mean economic and social change; it also affects our bond with something integral to our daily lives. As technology advances, we long for what we used to know but no longer have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be an appealing story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we make sense of change is by using familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings. These stories are easy to remember and share, and the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, almost every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I focused on how some of the greatest minds from the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers. I wanted to show that these famous figures were creatures of habit, just like us. 

The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the conditions that support creative work, not the work itself. It’s about the process, not the meaning. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about the writer’s inner self. I agree.

In this book, I explore questions I struggle with myself: How can you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to focus entirely on a project or to dedicate a small part of each day to it? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to be more efficient? I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I provide examples of how successful people have faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas are built from small daily actions and how our habits affect our work.

The book is called ""Daily Rituals,"" but it’s really about routines. Routines might seem ordinary or thoughtless, like being on autopilot. However, a good routine can help you use your limited resources—like time, willpower, and optimism—effectively. A solid routine can guide your mental energy and help you avoid being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and couldn’t stick to a schedule.

This book was born from my own procrastination. One Sunday, instead of writing a story due the next day, I was tidying my office and making coffee. I’m a morning person, focused in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for other writers’ schedules. I found them fascinating and thought someone should collect these stories. That’s how I started the Daily Routines blog, which eventually led to this book.

The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of people’s routines as I found them in biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more thoroughly, keeping the variety and brevity that made the blog popular. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of an unexpected change in his family's plans when he was six years old. His father, who was very careful with money, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain due to rising interest rates. Instead, they rented a small house on the English coast. One rainy August day, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. This discovery sparked his interest in becoming a palaeontologist. By the end of his university studies, he knew he wanted to focus on the earliest periods of life, not on dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He was fascinated by the beginnings of life, studying ancient, delicate creatures in rocks.

After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard worried about finding a job, especially in a place he wanted to work. He was confident in his abilities but knew that getting a job wasn't always fair. When a teaching position at Tavistock College in London opened, he applied, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't attend due to an accident. The replacement professor disliked the absent professor and made sure Howard got the job instead. Howard was surprised and grateful, even after learning the real reason he was chosen. He was slightly disappointed but happy to have the job he wanted.

Howard often thought about how his professional life was orderly, with clear plans and goals, unlike the unpredictable nature of personal life. He realized how strangers could unexpectedly change his life, like when his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Frustrated, he returned to the college, postponed his lecture, and reported the theft. While having coffee with a colleague and a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, he learned about a new collection of fossils that needed study. This opportunity became his biggest challenge and secured his career. If not for the theft, he wouldn't have known about it. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding the funds to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. In his office at Oxford University, he mentions having ice cream made from bee larvae at home. Although they look like maggots, they taste 'slightly nutty and floral.' Making insects a normal part of our diet is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we experience. His research is quietly but significantly changing what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurant menus. 

Spence and his colleagues are part of a field called gastrophysics, which examines in detail how we experience food and drink. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates, and background noise all influence taste. In his book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-authored with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, Spence shares many interesting insights. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant tends to enjoy their meal the most. Also, we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab at Oxford is simple and not high-tech. It includes soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can collaborate creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a large food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less serious in universities. However, now that universities need to show their work has real-world impact, this type of research is more valued. 

Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often due to government regulations. Companies do this gradually so customers don't notice the change. Research shows that if people are told about the changes, they focus on the taste and may not like it as much.

Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a major food producer. At the time, people thought science and food didn't mix well, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal and Spence worked together on a dish called 'Sound of the Sea' at Blumenthal's restaurant. Spence notes that the Italian futurists were experimenting with sound and food a century ago, but it didn't become popular.

Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. For example, his research shows that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon pair music with meals served to passengers. Last year, a brand released an app that played music while ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says is a common oversight.

At home, Spence's dinner parties are quite experimental. They've eaten rabbit with fur on the cutlery and used remote-controlled lights. They've also tested different drinks with sound to see if they have different pitches. For Spence, home, shops, food events, and international conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, fake facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We juggle many roles while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows, with the help of our smartphones. These devices encourage us to fill every spare moment with activity. However, there's a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is a misleading and risky belief. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried that something will go wrong. Even though we think we are achieving a lot, multitasking actually makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can overstimulate the brain and cause confusion. Multitasking creates a craving for distraction, rewarding the brain for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain, is easily distracted by new things, like shiny objects that attract infants. This is ironic because we need this part of the brain to stay focused. Just having the chance to multitask can harm our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former psychology professor, calls this info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an unread email sits in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. Wilson found that the mental losses from multitasking are worse than those from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, discovered that learning new information while multitasking sends it to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, instead of the hippocampus, which organizes facts and ideas. Without TV, the information is stored in the hippocampus, making it easier to remember. Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to answer a text or ignore it. Decision-making is hard on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can end up making poor choices about important things. When discussing information overload with business leaders, scientists, and writers, email is often mentioned as a problem. It's not about email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and accomplish other tasks."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not considered important. Scientists focused on animal behaviors and their outcomes, not on whether animals had feelings or morals. But recently, this has started to change. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This shift has led to popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". These books have sparked a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? 

In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Those that opened the gate themselves showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? The observations are clear, but their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the brink of a major ethical change, like the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, suggests we should rethink how we view animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler version of our mind. Professor Euan MacPhail argues we should stop attributing human traits to animals. The disagreement is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is difficult, can we ever truly understand what it’s like to be a bat?

Balcombe describes an experiment with starlings, a type of bird, that he believes shows they can feel depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups were initially fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another. They learned to eat only from the tasty box. Later, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the birds in the comfortable cages ate them. Balcombe concluded that the birds in the poor cages became pessimistic. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, ""We look back with horror at times of racism. One day, we will feel the same about how we treat animals. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger."" If Balcombe were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his views. Manning, who wrote a textbook on animal behavior, says, ""We are seeing a change. In the early 20th century, people thought animals thought like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now, we are swinging back. But it’s a controversial topic, and we should avoid letting personal opinions influence the discussion."""
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way of engaging with what we read or hear to understand it more deeply. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K. and a former computer science lecturer, notes that people often believe argument helps find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there is concern that it changes how we solve complex problems and makes deep thinking harder. West points out that we are bombarded with poor but appealing ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Interestingly, having more data doesn't necessarily lead to better knowledge or decisions. Despite this, West finds it surprising that our thinking quality hasn't been greatly affected.

The National Endowment for the Arts reports a 10% decline in literary reading, with the decline speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media has a cost. She suggests that less reading might lead to weaker critical thinking because people now focus more on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing. However, there is no clear answer yet on how technology affects critical thinking. Technology's growing presence has made it difficult for academics to rely on their previous beliefs. Computers, video games, and the internet can have both positive and negative effects, depending on how they are used. For instance, a computer game might either help or hinder critical thinking. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links might prevent deeper thought.

Greenfield, who reviewed over 50 studies on learning and technology, says that technology changes how people think. She notes that reading enhances imagination and critical thinking in ways that visual media like video games and TV do not. Reading helps develop imagination, reflection, and vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are real-time and don't allow time for reflection or analysis. As a result, many people, especially younger ones, may not reach their full potential.

How society views technology influences its perception of critical thinking. This is especially true with video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video and computer games are not just entertainment but also valuable learning tools. Evidence shows that games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in realistic virtual environments. These games allow players to explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise. In the digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford, when not writing about how we should live, works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after feeling unhappy with office work and his role in social policy institutions. His first book praised the benefits of manual work, while his latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book while shopping, noticing ads on a credit card machine during a short delay. Crawford realized that these constant demands on our attention are hard to escape. We should be able to decide what we focus on, but often we can't because of things we're not fully aware of. It's becoming harder to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people tend to isolate themselves and avoid simple interactions like talking to strangers. Crawford points out that we often experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us and take over our desires. Many people share his concerns. For example, office workers often complain about emails but then spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just having a phone visible can distract us, a common experience for those who feel drawn to their phones during dinner. There's no scientific proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. While it might seem like technology is the problem, Crawford believes it has just made it easier for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, our self-control is tested, affecting our social interactions. We prefer texting friends to avoid real conversations. By only interacting with digital versions of people, we risk losing something important in society. Screens are only part of the issue. Crawford uses his gym as an example. It used to have one music player for everyone, which could cause disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds, making the gym less social. Real connections often happen through resolving conflicts, like different music tastes. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he recommends engaging in skilled activities to connect with the world meaningfully. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real-world challenges. These roles require good judgment and managing others in the same space. Engaging with the world this way makes artificial experiences seem less appealing. This doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but it's important to use your judgment. There are many benefits, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions is tiring and makes it hard to focus on important things. Focusing on one thing helps you pay attention to others."
13,"Text: The question ""What do you do for a living?"" is common in small talk, and people often define themselves by their jobs. For most, it's easy to answer, but for a philosopher like me, it's a bit more complicated. Calling oneself a philosopher can sound pretentious because it might suggest having access to some higher truth, which is not the case. Philosophers are just like everyone else, but this stereotype persists. 

One reason for this stereotype is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others' actions and value intellectual life. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, believed that a life of contemplation was the most virtuous. While few modern philosophers agree, philosophy is still associated with deep thinking. Socrates, another Greek philosopher, said, ""The unexamined life is not worth living,"" meaning that blindly following cultural norms is unsatisfying. Reflecting on life helps us make our own decisions. However, living an examined life doesn't mean reading philosophical classics or dedicating life to intellectual reflection. It means looking closely at everyday experiences to see if they deserve their importance. It doesn't require living like a sage, isolated from society. Instead, it's practical and involves sharing knowledge, which is essential for a good life.

Another reason for the misconception about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from everyday life, especially for those without formal training. This isn't entirely philosophers' fault; university funding and evaluations focus on expensive, hard-to-access journals. This limits philosophers' ability to share ideas beyond a small group of experts. To outsiders, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. While philosophers once challenged this view, many now accept it. The university system created this isolation, and academics have supported it. As philosophy becomes more focused on specific debates, explaining these ideas to non-experts is difficult. In some areas, philosophy has withdrawn from society, and this needs to change.

I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I work in ethics, which evaluates human actions. But this title feels insufficient because ethics is often linked to formal codes and laws. Recently, ethics has come to mean applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if an action is ""ethical"" or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often engage with them. However, philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start with whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, attitudes towards art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people examine the practices and behaviors that shape their lives. This might confirm what we already know or show that our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, by examining these ideas, we contribute to everyone's benefit."
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and those who appreciate food might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. Historically, though, philosophers have often used food as a way to discuss other topics. When philosophers talked about eating, it was usually a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related ideas. 

Take the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, for example. He believed in seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in all areas of life. However, his name has become closely linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites, likely because these businesses hope to gain credibility by associating with a famous philosopher. 

Food is inherently social and cultural. It doesn't just appear; it comes from historical backgrounds and is shared with others in our communities. These communities provide dining companions and the systems for growing and distributing food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than any other product, making it a natural topic for philosophical study.

Once food is prepared, critics start discussing and writing about it. But why do they have such a special status? One philosopher pointed out that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, food critics are just better at describing tastes. Philosophically, the way we perceive taste hasn't been studied much, as most research has focused on vision. This needs to change.

Another aspect of food is its aesthetics. We often call paintings or music beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern cooking, food deserves a place in discussions about beauty, like sculpture or poetry. However, food is eaten and destroyed in the process, unlike art or music, which lasts over time. So, it's incorrect to think of food as an object of aesthetic value.

There are many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices, which is a valid area of study.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of personal relationships. In home kitchens, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional cooks, however, have duties to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are for qualified staff, and their relationships are professional, not personal.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by appreciating others' food and by forming personal connections through shared meals, a practice with a long history in diplomacy. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, an American game designer, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were no longer fun or challenging. This led him to think about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect future games? He took a classic game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this version, decisions made during the game have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at certain times. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and personal rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said, ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau was later asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to stop diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was praised, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was not based on an existing game. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players explore and conquer new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story intact. They hire testers to see how the game plays out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said, ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.’

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a niche interest. He said, ‘I thought it was different and good, but strange and unexpected. I thought only a few people would like it.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He sees it as a major advancement in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, and excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and legacy games offer that constantly.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the unfolding adventure was more important than concerns about the game's longevity. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and damaging the board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice. You’re buying an experience. It adds a story element like video games.’ The legacy format is influenced by video games and the trend for episodic entertainment from TV series. Daviau once wanted to be a TV writer but ended up in advertising and then game design. The desire to tell stories stayed with him. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how it ends and begins,’ he said. ‘But you also need more than just an outline.’

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is curious to see how others will develop the idea. But he also thinks people might soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who manages the studio that published SeaFall, believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games. ‘It’s the kind of idea that changes what a board game can be,’ he said."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like something from a children's movie, became very popular online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to imagine animals behaving like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very intelligent despite looking so different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

Many people think that attributing human traits to animals is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that the real problem is ""anthropodenial""—the refusal to see human-like traits in animals. He has studied animal behavior for decades and found that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often think.

De Waal believes that ignoring animal intelligence is a modern idea. In medieval and early modern Europe, people thought animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, scientists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said that the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, behaviorism became popular. This approach focused on training animals with rewards and punishments, which led people to see animals as simple machines. Anyone who thought animals had complex inner lives was considered unscientific. This view coincided with a time when humans were destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.

Fortunately, de Waal thinks we are starting to change our views. We are beginning to see animal intelligence as part of a spectrum that includes humans. He notes that there has been a lot of new information about animal intelligence shared online in recent years. The best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique abilities of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they’ve hidden nuts, something humans often struggle with.

In her book ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us on how many color patterns we can make on our skin. Seeing us fail, it might think we are not very smart.

De Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape story. He thinks it’s unlikely that Inky knew how to find a drain leading to the ocean. However, he acknowledges that viral stories like this can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers became upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but what really convinced people was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our human minds are influenced by stories and visuals."
17,"Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialization. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for years, but experts say we are about to see a big increase in their use across many industries. However, many countries are not ready for this change. Most people agree that robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, but they still believe their own jobs will remain the same. This is not true, as robotic automation will affect every industry soon. 

For instance, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a job that would take two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a startup called Simbe Robotics has introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check if products are stocked and priced correctly. 

Supporters of robotic automation point out that robots still need humans to service and program them, which could create new, high-skilled jobs. Critics, however, worry that we are not ready for the loss of human interaction in the workplace. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will start making laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but there will still be a lack of skilled workers.

Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be most affected by automation. He suggests that they should not rely on the government to protect their jobs but should instead seek retraining. The idea of having the same job for life is outdated. New developments in robotics will lead to robots that can live with us and interact in more advanced ways, similar to those in science fiction. This presents a great opportunity for businesses but also requires new safety and privacy regulations.

With many jobs at risk, education is key to preparing for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive in a changing job market."
18,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered the question of why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response highlights a common curiosity: why do people risk their lives for something that seems pointless? Mallory's answer might inspire some to follow their dreams, as it challenges people to face the unknown. The real value of his answer is its simplicity, suggesting that climbing might just be about adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules, from bouldering to climbing Himalayan peaks. He argued that the style of climbing, like using more or less equipment, should match the rules of the specific climbing activity. Over the years, this idea has become central to discussions about climbing in the West, influencing everything from magazines to debates around campfires.

For many climbers, the love of climbing comes from the sense of freedom it provides. However, climbing can also be very limiting, like being stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. Yet, some argue that the simplicity of having limited choices is a form of freedom itself.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective in his recent essay. He suggests asking ""Why do people climb?"" instead of just ""Why climb?"" Fitschen believes climbing is part of our nature, an evolutionary trait that drives us to take on challenges and push our limits, even with risks. The joy of climbing, then, is more about our biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor adds another view in his essay. He believes climbing helps develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor thinks they are crucial in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing, therefore, has practical value by helping people develop qualities that are useful in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who rely only on themselves, without help from others or technology, must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred controversy by suggesting that independent climbs deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or with aids like bottled oxygen. Their essay may have encouraged some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Finally, looking beyond Western ideas, climbing often involves being in the moment and going with the flow. The physical effort, meditative focus, and intuitive problem-solving are key parts of climbing. Some argue that climbing is similar to Zen practices, which aim to train the mind for peace. This offers another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known as an intellectual and sometimes serious person who focused on European piano music. He wrote and performed a lot but rarely taught. Those close to him saw a playful side, but this was not often shown in his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel didn't take the request seriously. He had taught very few students and didn't see a reason to start now. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, ""You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk."" However, something about Kit, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played very well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital where he played beautifully. Brendel thought, ""I have to make time for him."" Kit's performance was rare because he had a clear understanding of the music and played with great subtlety.

As Brendel steps back from public life, Kit is slowly entering it, with Brendel cautious about him burning out too soon. Kit, now 19, is always busy outside of lessons, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under the watchful eye of his mother. He also composes music. Brendel says this is important because writing music helps you understand it better. He noticed Kit has an amazing memory and is a great sight reader. More importantly, Kit listens to his own playing and understands Brendel's instructions, applying them throughout a piece.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, saying it's harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit plays some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

Now at 80, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He explains that when he was young, he didn't want to be famous quickly but aimed to achieve certain things by 50. By that age, he had done most of them but continued to do more. Although he no longer has the physical strength to play, he still thinks about music and enjoys his new life."
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden wasn’t in a dirty city; it was by a river and gently sloped down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this—places of peace and solitude. Grandad’s garden wasn’t fancy. He didn’t have a greenhouse like some neighbors, who made theirs from old window frames. They used plastic to cover broken glass.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved, but he wasn’t without humor. He liked to say things like, “It’s immaterial to me,” instead of just saying, “I don’t mind.” He probably wished he had achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn’t passionate about. He wasn’t very ambitious, though he and my mom once considered moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. However, he was very skilled at home repairs. He could build amazing things like bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I did like the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn’t get the chance, she simply said, “You’d never have practiced.”

Given the choice between moors, woods, or river, I always chose the river. I loved to explore it with my imagination. I’d go with a fishing net and old sandals, looking for a spot to take off my shoes and try to catch fish. After failing to keep them alive at home, I’d release them back into the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father told me about an apprentice gardener job in the Parks Department. He thought I might be interested. Although he might have preferred me to become a carpenter, I like to think he believed things might work out if I pursued gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw my passion for it and hoped it would lead to something good."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on the Isle of Muck, a small Scottish island. I do the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen's sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and MacEwen gently pets him. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. He points out the nearby islands to me. ""That one is Eigg,"" he shouts over the wind. ""To the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do."" I see heavy clouds pouring rain on Rum's mountains. ""Beyond Rum is the island of Soay,"" he adds. Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep as rain approaches. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Muck is volcanic, three kilometers long and half as wide. The geese eat a lot of grass, and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. As we herd the sheep, Tie, the sheepdog, struggles to control the flock. ""Away to me, Tie,"" MacEwen instructs, meaning the dog should circle right. But Tie goes straight through the flock, causing chaos. ""Tie,"" MacEwen says, disappointed. The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mainly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny. Their son, Colin, takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter, Mary, runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. ""They leave the house and only come back when they're hungry,"" Mary says. However, island life has its challenges. Electricity is only available part-time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, Mary prepares breakfast by torchlight. I adjust to this, along with having no mobile phone service. ""There's reception on the hill,"" Mary tells me. ""Most people give up after a couple of days and put their phones away."" I do the same. Life on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. The boat today brings groceries and three musicians, who perform a concert in the island's tearoom. The islanders enjoy the music, tapping their boots in rhythm. That night, by a warm fire, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ""Her father bought a small farm on the Isle of Soay from a newspaper ad, without seeing it. He'd never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it."" Did Jenny know about farming? ""She was good at typing,"" he laughs. I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary, who cooks it for dinner. By 7 pm, the fish is on the table, and it tastes amazing. The next morning, I am supposed to take a ferry to another island. However, many ferries have been canceled recently due to rough seas. If my ferry doesn't come, I'll be stuck on Muck for two more days. Secretly, I hope it doesn't come, phone or no phone."
22,"The game design industry used to be mainly for computer scientists and self-taught individuals, with few ways to enter it. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now it's being taken seriously. Industry experts aren't surprised by this change. However, it's not easy to get into. Creating video game spin-offs for new movies requires many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it's challenging to break into, but it is growing.

Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says it's tough to make progress in big companies or influence major games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever, not just leaders but also those who design systems and specific parts of games. So, how can you enter this competitive field? While many companies prefer a degree in computer science, Jim believes the key is to make games. The tools are available, and you need to create something to get a job or succeed independently. Game design is more a lifestyle than just a job. Like any creative work, it must be practiced to be real.

Another expert, John Field, agrees that just starting is important, but it's more complex than that. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry's current demands. Even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and business sense to contribute to this evolving field. Can you succeed on your own? ""Maybe, but it's quite difficult,"" says John. A good postgraduate course in games can help, offering support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and have a strong interest in arts and contemporary culture. They might have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in the field. Networking is also important to get ahead in games, as in many other areas.

The old stereotype of a teenage boy playing video games has changed. Now, games are seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. Games have become popular with large audiences and are a great way to learn. He sees this already big area as full of possibilities and opportunities."
23,"Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me, but he didn't force me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have.

When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It's only through practice that you can score spectacular goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I focus on helping them enjoy learning skills.

I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope his habit of kicking them around doesn't mean he's like me in that way.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so younger players like me could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He didn't gather us and say, ""This is your big chance,"" but we knew it was. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, ""You can't win anything with kids."" That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.

I rely a lot on close friends and family. Having a lot of money can cause problems. People sometimes say, ""I can't believe you let your mother keep working."" Of course, I've helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong and would be offended if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I enjoy using my money to make life easier for those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn't solve everything.

After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off, maybe longer, to do things I haven't been able to do. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father couldn't write anything sellable while we were in Los Angeles because he didn't like the city. Sam was worried about losing money and clients, so he found us a cheap place to live. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn't popular with day-trippers. The road to get there was not appealing, and the nearby resort of La Carmella was more attractive for those with some money. Only people who were broke or loved surfing would go the extra mile to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, the place filled with people. After months of being almost alone, we were suddenly surrounded by activity. My father was busy trying to meet a writing deadline and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty, without him noticing. We didn't have a dog when we first moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to adopt us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father half-heartedly threw a boot at him, but Rusty wasn't scared. I asked my father who Rusty might belong to, and he said, ""You're wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes, he brought things he hadn't dug up, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. Rusty also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed tireless. One surfer stood out with her graceful style. She decided to finish for the day and rode a final wave to the shore. She greeted me and asked why I hadn't joined them. I told her I didn't have a surfboard and no money to buy one. She noticed I was British and asked if I was visiting. I explained that I lived there because my father was writing a film script. She asked if she might know him, and I said his name was Rufus Marsh. She recognized the name from his novel, ""Tall as the Morning,"" and looked at me with new interest. I realized people were friendly but only truly interested when I mentioned my father's book."
25,"Violet Hetherington was standing in a long queue at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline cruise ship. Her friend Annie, who often traveled, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. However, this advice turned out to be wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers said there was a problem with the computer system, which made the waiting passengers frustrated. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service.

Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. This was more troubling than the long wait because all her important contacts were stored in it. Her son Harry had always warned her to avoid such mistakes. She asked a friendly couple behind her in the queue if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message, asking him to contact her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at her flat. If it wasn’t there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York.

Finally, the queue started moving, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship’s foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were fake walnut panels, shiny chandeliers, and carpets like those in airports. She took the elevator, which was crowded with tired passengers, to her room on the twelfth floor. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested. She had paid extra to ensure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing striking images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent morning, Maloof stood among all these items, realizing he had stumbled upon something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’

For some time, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together the details of Maier’s life. They contacted local families who employed her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit eccentric, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’

Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although she wasn’t very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed to be passionate about her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was done for commercial reasons. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this, or did she borrow ideas from those who came before her?’

Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I progressed as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. However, this isn't true for Eleanor Catton's book, *The Luminaries*. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who then asked, ""What's it about?"" This is a tough question for any author. 

*The Luminaries* is set in New Zealand during the 1860s. It involves a series of crimes and a group of 12 men trying to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she replied modestly. She said it's nice coming from a small country because everyone shares in the success. She received a lot of support from people back home. She also mentioned that it bothers her when people don't see her book as a philosophical work. 

Catton had the idea to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part being half the length of the previous one. This makes the story feel like it speeds up. I asked if it matters whether readers notice this. She said she wanted to create a book with hidden patterns that readers could explore if they wanted to. Despite its experimental structure, *The Luminaries* is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she didn't plan the story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then find creative ways to resolve them. 

One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers. We also talked about her love for TV drama series. Considering how *The Luminaries* uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue, I asked if she might be interested in screenwriting. She said that could be interesting. Her conversation was lively and full of enthusiasm, especially when talking about her writing and New Zealand. She mentioned how her imagination changes when she visits different places, like Britain. She understands why some writers leave New Zealand for busier places to be around more people. But for now, she plans to stay in New Zealand, and many hope it continues to inspire her future novels."
28,"When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he loved using tools in his dad’s garage and playing the guitar. These hobbies became his career for the last forty years: making steel-string acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny says, ""I’m still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? And using different types of wood changes the sound. It still amazes me.""

Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ""Some people would get a job and save money to buy one,"" he says. ""But I thought if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars to understand how different shapes and woods affected the sound and how to build them."" The bass was the first instrument Jonny made from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ""We designed and built model boats and planes, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use tools. I also fixed and customized instruments for my friends.""

Jonny’s bass guitar was a success, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a career. ""I was also interested in painting and sculpture,"" he says. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. ""Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,"" he remembers. But halfway through, he left the course. ""I was too independent for it,"" he says. ""But I realized what I wanted to do. I was still interested in sculpture, but I saw that making guitars is like sculpting sound. It seemed more practical than pure art because you make things people use.""

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a top guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ""still just getting by."" He admits he can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to get noticed. He went to music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his guitars, which was difficult for him.

Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ""When I started, people thought the best acoustic guitars were made in the USA,"" he says. ""UK-made guitars weren’t seen as good, even though we’ve always had good courses and skills here. But now, our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve."" Jonny says valuable skills can be learned in classes, and he encourages new instrument-makers to take courses. However, he also believes there’s no substitute for trial and error. ""Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,"" Jonny says. ""If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If someone else teaches you, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything."""
29,"Any talk about English conversation usually starts with the weather. This is a common tradition, and many writers mention the famous quote by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This statement is still true today. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why English people seem so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They fail because they think that when English people talk about the weather, they are actually interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson notes that English weather is not very exciting, lacking extreme events like tornadoes or blizzards, and finds the English interest in it puzzling. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you can never be sure what the weather will be like.

My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the real point. English people don't talk about the weather because they care about it; instead, it's a way to start conversations and connect with others. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not really about the weather. They are like greetings or ways to fill gaps in conversation. This is similar to how monkeys and apes groom each other to bond socially. There are specific times when English people use weather-talk: as a greeting, to break the ice and start a conversation, or as a topic when there is nothing else to say. This happens often enough that it seems like English people talk about the weather all the time. An English conversation might start with a weather-related greeting, use more weather-talk to keep the conversation going, and return to it if there is a pause. This is why people from other countries, and even some English writers, think that English people are obsessed with the weather."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how impressive it was for the Romans to build a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were already interested because they chose this trip over more glamorous ones to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not satisfying. When she couldn't find a historical novel to give more context and interest to life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching in 2001, Alice started a new career as an author. She felt it was a big change from her successful teaching career. ‘Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very demanding. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not as tiring. My old teaching colleagues are jealous because I still connect with children through my stories.’ Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. ‘Many books for teenagers now focus on negative experiences. They are well written,’ she adds, ‘but many are dark or completely fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different.’ Alice always taught English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy, and she loves seeing children go from bored to interested. ‘I love when bored children become interested. It’s up to me to make that happen.’ She sees writing as an extension of teaching. She was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher also suggested she try a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday on a course I didn’t think I needed.’ Before the course, she had to send her best piece of fiction, which she found out just days before leaving. ‘I sat at the computer and created a story about a Roman couple and their baby.’ Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted. During the course, other students reviewed her work and suggested she publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her school’s head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, a critic and editor, helped her edit the novel. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve written – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, he suggests different words. My instinct is to keep adding scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to compete in a special race. The race would be between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

""I'm excited about it,"" Jonny said at the start line. ""I've never done anything like this before. The roads have beautiful views, and it's very cold right now, so I'll be warm in the car."" Alistair was also eager, but unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, he was dressed in full winter cycling gear. The cold didn't bother him. ""Honestly,"" he said, ""I've seen Jonny drive before, so I'm not sure he'll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race began at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to end at Yorkshire's highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 meters up. This might not be a problem for the car, but Alistair's first few miles included a steep 25 percent incline, making it tough from the start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sped away on his bike, heading up a hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss, while Jonny got into the car and hit the road. The next time they would see each other would be at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?

Jonny's early confidence was quickly challenged. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he encountered his first obstacle: a giant tractor moving onto the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he joked to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it's because of this farmer!"" After dealing with the tractor, Jonny was back on track, driving into the morning mist.

Meanwhile, Alistair was struggling with the steep slope. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched curiously as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out, he had a chance to show his skills. He picked up speed, head down, feet on the pedals.

In the car, Jonny faced another local challenge. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have been around since before cars were invented, and the roads are not built for speed. Jonny carefully navigated a very narrow corner and drove through a stream on the road. Once past the last village, he raced straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping, he reached the line and stopped. 

Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, ""Is he here?"" When they said no, he raised his arms in victory. Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. ""Well done,"" Jonny said, clearly disappointed. ""I'm gutted."""
32,"Playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a unique experience because of the silence. When you bounce the ball on the soft grass, you hear only the sound of your own shots. The well-kept grass, the historic stadium, the players in white, and the respectful audience create a special atmosphere that feels separate from the outside world. This quiet helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to block out everything except the game and the point I'm playing. The silence is only broken by applause and cheers when a point is won. Even though there are 15,000 people watching in the stadium and millions more on TV, I am so focused that I hardly notice them. 

In 2008, I played Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach forever, taught me that Wimbledon is the most important tournament. By age 14, I was already telling my friends that I would play and win there one day. Before 2008, I had played and lost twice to Federer in the finals. The 2006 loss wasn't too hard because I was just happy to have reached the final at age 20. But the 2007 loss was devastating because I knew I could have done better. It wasn't my skills that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing is always painful, but it's worse when you know you had a chance to win. 

Toni, who is usually very tough on me, tried to comfort me after that loss, saying there would be more chances. I told him he didn't understand, that it might have been my last chance to win. I know a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I felt I had missed a big one in 2007. But Toni was right; I got another chance in 2008. I was confident I had learned from my previous defeat and that my mindset would be strong this time. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends, but we didn't talk about the match. They knew I was already mentally preparing for it, and I needed that space to be mine alone until the match started."
33,"In April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society helped make Jane famous by creating articles and TV documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements. Many stories about her life focus on her adventurous spirit or her role as a feminist, but these can undervalue her true contributions.

Jane Goodall's work is highly respected in the scientific community. Her research has been widely referenced, and many of her students have become influential scientists. Her forty-year study of chimpanzees has provided a vast amount of data. She is considered a pioneer in her field and the world's leading zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew they ate meat or used tools, and we didn't realize they had emotions similar to ours or complex social systems. We also didn't know that chimpanzee communities have different cultural traditions.

Jane's book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her long-term study in Gombe, Nigeria, is seen as one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and, because chimpanzees are our closest relatives, she also changed how we think about ourselves.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. When she was five, she disappeared one afternoon, causing a search by police and neighbors. She reappeared with straw in her hair, explaining that she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity and patience hinted at her future as a biologist."
34,"Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist who can speak in many different voices. During our first conversation, she used the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV, cartoons, and even some workplace training videos. Recently, she did a voiceover about back injuries, which required her to quickly learn medical terms.

Shirley explains that doing voiceovers is more than just making funny voices. Many well-known actors want to do voiceover work, but they often don't get the roles because they are used to acting with their whole bodies, not just their voices. After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning to become a traditional actor. She occasionally sang jingles for TV ads, and one day, she was asked to try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. Although it seemed silly, she got a major role, which led her to realize her talent for voiceovers.

In her second film, Shirley voiced the main character, her brother, and her mother. Female actors often voice young boys and girls because their voices are lighter, and hiring child actors involves complicated procedures that production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create different child voices by watching children’s TV and practicing.

Her work includes a variety of projects, from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. She finds it challenging to sound enthusiastic about things she doesn't care about, but smiling while talking helps make her voice sound cheerful. Animation work is her favorite because interacting with other actors feels like a holiday.

The competition in voiceover work is tough, and having a good showreel is crucial. Shirley advises investing in a strong showreel and suggests attending specialist workshops for those interested in voiceover careers. She believes that a passion for voices is essential and describes herself as obsessed with them. Sometimes, after working in a particular voice, she continues speaking that way for hours or even days. Her children are used to hearing her speak in different voices."
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many dream about as kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more practical careers, like becoming a tax lawyer or working in auto parts manufacturing. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do just that. 

People don't all become cartoonists in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. In my case, I had a typical cartoonist's childhood: I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons on local issues. I created some ideas, they bought them, and within a few months, I was earning enough to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are basic, but it's still a challenging job. You shouldn't try to become a cartoonist unless you feel you can't do anything else. It's easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don't refuse any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don't really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are mostly over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create the work and sell it. The better you are at this, the more successful you'll be. I've seen cartoonists with average talent but great business skills do better than artistic geniuses who lack those skills.

It's surprising how many people are afraid someone will steal their ideas, even if they've never sold a cartoon. Some are so worried they won't let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small 'c' for 'copyright,' put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of those things was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to get rid of it? I took it to the dump and was about to throw it away when a young man approached me, looking confused. He asked, ""Are you really going to throw that away?"" I said yes, already feeling a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I agreed. We went our separate ways, but I felt sad about it for years.

Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later inside a fish. The email was from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back and used it to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so emotional; I would have paid anything, but his price was fair. I had forgotten my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have found this whole situation funny!

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s when it was very popular. I loved its calming sound, but I didn't make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn't need to be a great musician to be a rock star. When I got my guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I felt the urge to stand up and play it with a strap over my shoulder. My fingers remembered the chords, even though I couldn't draw them. My fingertips felt the familiar pain of pressing the strings.

The electric guitar isn't really for playing alone, so now that I'm learning it again, I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are others my age with similar stories. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" which is about people who can't sleep well, I felt like I was the only one talking about how dangerous it is to not get enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who struggle with sleep know how important it is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them in these discussions. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, missing the last hour or two of sleep. This is usually REM sleep, which is when we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM sleep, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years dreaming. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests that dreams are important. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who thought that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not fully support this idea. The study of dreams shifted to focus more on their physical origins rather than psychological ones. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He concluded that people who are interested in creativity use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Doesn't everyone—like teachers, software designers, and politicians—need to think creatively? According to Stickgold, dreams help us combine things in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create ideas that break our usual way of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ignore the obvious and connect things in unexpected ways. This is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, or one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come so quickly that my fingers can hardly keep up. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and we all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, which has a beautiful view of the sea, there are empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading figure in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate famous paintings from artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that even art experts can mistake them for the originals. While the original paintings are worth millions, Susie's copies sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them.

Susie has many clients, including galleries and private collectors, but she keeps their names private. Some collectors buy her copies to show off, while others use them to save on insurance by keeping the original in a safe. Susie is honest about her work and always signs her name on the back of the canvas. She believes that making a poor copy would disrespect the original artist. Although some people sell copies as originals, which is illegal, Susie avoids this because it could damage her reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. This job taught her to be precise and accurate, skills that are important in her current work. She advises young artists to learn to draw well and to study hard. Susie specializes in French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. She explains that while impressionist art looks simple, it requires great attention to detail.

Despite her talent, Susie doesn't create her own original art. She has tried, but her attempts, like oil paintings of fishing nets, ended up looking like photographs. She is a perfectionist and finds satisfaction in her work as a copyist, which provides her with a good living."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest sailor. From a young age, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a strong connection with the boats she sailed around the world, working in perfect harmony with them. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly longed to be back at sea, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop race around the world, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was a small, cramped space where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how she meticulously planned everything, down to the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly displayed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies and rations. Her attention to detail in maintaining the boat was as impressive as her sailing skills. The boat was her entire world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. This experience made her think differently and realize things she hadn't considered before. Seeing abandoned whaling stations felt like a warning about how humans take what they want and move on.

When I met Ellen at her office, she had just finished an intense conference call. She explained why urgent action is needed to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. These are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways not to use them up,"" she said. Initially, her message was about using less, but she later realized the importance of reusing. She passionately talks about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, Ellen has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says, ""but I love learning. The current situation became something I couldn't ignore. Sailing seemed selfish in comparison. This is about finding how my voice can be most useful. It really matters.""

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It defines who I am. At sea, you are connected to everything around you, focused on records, practicalities, and survival. My new message isn't as simple as saying, 'I’m going to be the fastest person around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I've ever done."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous among teenagers. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to encourage them to go outside and try new challenges. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

I talked to some experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agreed that a young climber might be physically strong enough, but they were unsure if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also doubted that a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these concerns before. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that – there's still a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow stronger gives me confidence.'

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it just his father's ambition? Paul insists, 'This isn't about me wanting fame through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, why not now? We regularly check with him to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting challenge. The more exciting the record, the more interest it gets. This creates a challenge for Jordan. People might say that focusing on records takes away from the enjoyment, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something impressive, like climbing Everest. Paul adds, 'If Jordan decides tomorrow that he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we'll end this project and head to the gym.'"
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they aren't listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but even my classmates don't know much about classical music. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't own their music. The statistics for classical music are discouraging. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find this surprising. Why has interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries, declined? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. Some teenagers do attend classical concerts, but they are few. Although I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big fan of classical music. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably around that 3% mark. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm, with many mood changes, are challenging for us. We like things fast. Experts say we struggle to focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop songs also have lyrics that appeal more to teenagers than long classical pieces without words. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, we can find any music online, but we rarely choose classical. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says classical concert audiences have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many teenagers are in those audiences. In my orchestra, we play classical music in various places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why more people go to classical concerts as they get older, but I do know that if teenagers' parents love something, they often avoid it. Some blame schools for teenagers' lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are eager to play in school orchestras. They practice early and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy performing classical music, but it's not their first choice for listening. When we relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you regret that I’m here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie wouldn’t have minded if she had. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a wooded hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw the signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t seem to expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be kicked out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and headed for the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building where the horses were kept and a large area for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. Bonnie treated horses well. The horses were well cared for, she could see that right away. Almost every stall was full, and she walked along, looking at each horse and judging it. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony as she touched its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""But aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. Probably lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""You know, I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""It was in my dreams, and I was riding you to win a big competition…"" His name was above the stall: Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They can’t be far."" The room with all the riding equipment was – to Bonnie’s delight – unlocked. Absorbed in the fun task of putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she could see. Her nickname at her previous school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said admiringly, ""and I’m not joking, because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,"" she confided. She went around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, a little breeze brushing her cheek and making it glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he’d jump well."
43,"I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. Cody is a 15-year-old Australian who has already released several successful songs. How did a relaxed surfer end up performing on stage for thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" He remembers how it all started. ""But I was swimming every day and surfing. Those were more important to me back then; I had my life planned and lots to do. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online."" These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos on their social media. So Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The responses were overwhelming. Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with top coaches, focusing on his sport. But then record labels showed interest, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine, at 12 or 13, trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked reactions. ""I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody says it’s important to have a close group of great people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, we all have days of doubt. ""Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight, and he’s traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about that sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they’re here to support and encourage me in everything I do."" Success, in any career, comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to your big opportunity, even when it’s a bit scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be visiting countries I never thought I’d see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbag wall, which was there to stop the buildings from flooding when the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags into place. Last week, I worked with most of the town's adults for long hours, showing I could handle it. But my grandfather didn't seem to notice. With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the wood factory in Milltown. There were fragile ice shelves on both sides, and solid ice downstream. As I took off my pajamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. I didn't recognize him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there—a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It's better than having a famous grandfather because only he, my mom, and I know about it. Plus, I have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I patted the chain and went to the kitchen. ""Morning, Rex,"" Mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. ""You're up early for a Saturday. I'll make brunch after your training. Be careful."" ""Thanks, Mom."" I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ""Watch where you're going,"" he shouted. ""Where are you going?"" ""Sorry, Grandpa. I'm going kayaking."" As if my wetsuit didn't make that clear. As if he didn't see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it's getting harder. ""Why train? You didn't win the competition,"" he said. His words stung, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom gave me a sympathetic smile. ""Don't mind him. He's..."" ""...not himself right now,"" I finished for her. I didn't say he's always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a kid, he was my hero—from the time he showed me his photos in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don't go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. Yet, a part of me still wants to be loyal to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ""At least he's coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!"" I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ""It'll be warmer in South America,"" I said. ""If I find sponsors for my expedition."" She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I hurried to the boathouse in the backyard."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly Grandpa's work, but it looked different from anything he had done before and was obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. It showed a river that took up most of the scene. It wasn't a river she recognized and might not even be real, maybe just imaginary. The picture was strange and shapeless, yet beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green that the eye almost missed, as it was drawn into the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice—too casual, too detached—that showed her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out, if they could. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had scribbled there. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed to have a special meaning, as if they were important to her, but she didn't know why. And there was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it—for him to be so specific. Still, he hasn't finished it yet, so maybe he's going to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially having a name. I guess you can imagine his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not the artist's job to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to waste time telling every idiot..."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""...every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone who came along, they'd never get any work done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted her, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually, it was just to say the muse wasn't being kind to him that day, or that he'd have to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on, or something like that. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, having any influence over someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that's what happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I'll cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm quite unlucky that way.

What I was actually trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute! It's small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and has tiny glass-panelled doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet, so I was very excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, which means it has to stand in a corner. It's shaped like a triangle for that reason.

I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems I'll be in my small room for a while. I don't really mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only take a couple of centimetres off the bottom...

That's when I had the idea. If I couldn't cut anything off Gran's cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house. They secretly take things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be difficult to meet fans' expectations. People who love the book have strong opinions about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' point of view, not the humans', which made filming more complicated. The most important thing was getting the size difference right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when filming them, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. To show the Borrowers' view of the human world, the crew had to film from no higher than 15 centimeters off the ground, which wore out a lot of jeans! We only raised the cameras for aerial shots. A big challenge was making the shadows look right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry giant items like scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh. In the story, there's a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary they didn't have to act. Getting the costumes right was important to me, and other directors have struggled with this in other versions. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn't sit during breaks and had to be sewn into the dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, it was really hot during filming, and I don't think they appreciated my attention to detail! Most scenes away from the Borrowers' home were filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren't accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn't allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once filmed a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren't there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people pretending to be friends, and the ones asking for free tickets to my dad's concerts. ""Everything's going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we're staying permanently. I chose this school because I want to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal. 

I walk into the school's main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the school secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not looking very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused but types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That's one good thing—few people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it's printing,"" she says, then hands me the schedule. English Literature is my first class. Great, I like English. I'll be late, though. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn't look lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already calling roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. Perfect, no one will suspect anything! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew they were too flashy. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she asks. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After discussing the books we'll read this year, she lets us socialize. All teachers should do this. ""So why'd you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many options. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. ""He's an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I'm Becca, by the way."" And she doesn't seem to care. Perfect."
49,"The average American teenage girl today is expected to do a lot. She should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Teenagers can't just go to school and be average; they need to stand out. Being average is not enough, and not having big ambitions is seen as being lazy. 

Teenager Kristen Loose explains that people, especially adults, often forget how much pressure teenagers face today. They have lots of homework, tests, extra activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life. Despite these pressures, negative stereotypes about teenagers still exist, often spread by the media. These stereotypes include being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might fit these descriptions, it's not fair to label the whole generation this way.

Loose points out that many people think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or on their phones. She disagrees, saying that while she keeps her phone close, it's not just for fun. It's a tool that helps teenagers manage their busy lives. Today, students are expected to have instant access to information and be reachable at all times, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can work anywhere, even doing homework on the go. Schoolwork and activities now demand attention around the clock, adding to the stress of already busy teens.

Many teenagers start their day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight, filled with school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. A survey by the US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20% of teens get enough sleep, and 28% admitted to falling asleep in school at least once a week due to lack of sleep.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time a week, which isn't much out of 168 hours. She doesn't waste this time on social media or TV but focuses on volunteering. Olsen believes the stereotype of teenagers is that they only care about themselves, but she enjoys helping others and making a positive impact in her community.

In the future, the stereotype of teenagers might change, but they will continue to challenge it and push the world forward. A new generation of students will keep making a difference, even before they finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live near Bishop, a small town in the US surrounded by wilderness, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the past few years, this group has launched more than fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project with a twist: it's part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These stars appear when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As night falls, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside, there's a camera, an altitude-measuring instrument, and a thermometer to track temperature changes. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, inflates the balloon until it's as big as a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For these kids, that's normal. Finally, it's time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chant, and the balloon rises. Some run and track it with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There's a quiet, shared sense of wonder. Then the balloon vanishes into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside, looking at a sky so clear, it's hard to believe you're just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I see a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor streaks across the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon expands until it's almost as big as a house. Then it bursts in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn't easy, but that's part of the fun. There's little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ says the group’s leader, noting they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn't.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To reach it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘It's important to remember that these students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild and dangerous to some is just normal life to others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera didn't record any shooting stars. It's a bit disappointing, but it's also a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. And it's another adventure story to share with others."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she wasn't interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. Her interest started by accident. Her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a common phase for kids, which she had ignored. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. It amazed her, and she realized she wanted to pursue it.

I asked her about the support she received since Palaeontology wasn't a typical career choice for young people then. She recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. She was nervous, fearing he might find her annoying with her questions. However, he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

I mentioned how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe admits that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She finds the portrayal of palaeontologists in films misleading, often showing them as either eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks. These films don't accurately show their daily work.

Chloe explains that her job is varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific journals. Although not a daily task, she also communicates scientific findings to the public. She believes it's important to address misunderstandings about science and enjoys reaching out to young people to inspire them about the natural world and science.

The TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a chance for Chloe to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She praises the program makers for their knowledge and says she only needed to offer advice occasionally, like ensuring dinosaurs shown lived in the same time period. The program attracted audiences of all ages because it depicted dinosaurs more accurately than movies like Jurassic Park.

I asked why dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain a research focus. Chloe thinks they appeal to our inner explorer. They spark our imagination and remind us that there is still much to discover, making Palaeontology a form of time travel."
52,"I'm going to say this just once: when you're on a car trip with your family, even if you're six years old, you probably know you're not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" And really, once you arrive, it's not ""there"" anymore; it's ""here."" So, if you think you might be ""there,"" you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" And no one wants to be ""there"" more than the parents who have to answer that question repeatedly during long car trips. Seriously, what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing expected of you? You can watch DVDs you haven't seen, listen to music, or do puzzles you've had for a while, while the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, there's mom or dad, who hands out juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio station, and adjusts the temperature—basically, they make sure everything goes smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying—like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. What? He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it's his other foot, then a hand, and soon he's in my space, and we're fighting. The driver and co-pilot have to separate us as the car speeds up and swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a while. The beautiful scenery continues to pass by. Soon after, I'm trying to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. But the car isn't going fast, and the window isn't open. Where's it coming from? My brother is in the next seat, quietly blowing air on me. He's on his side, not touching me, so he's technically not doing anything wrong. Just breathing? What's the problem with that? The anger builds. Tim gets yelled at, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again—for now. Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us kids in the back seat. For example, when we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he often says, ""Yes. We're here. Get out of the car."" ""But Dad, we're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour."" ""Oh, well, then maybe we're not there yet."" That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you're finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move as far away as they can from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you're not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope customers will love the experience and return. Zuzi explains their motivation: ""With so much technology, everyone is busy on their phones. We wanted to bring people together without screens. It's natural for us to connect and communicate.""

The games in their café are called 'Eurogames.' These games have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone involved until the end. This idea was improved in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction.

One popular Eurogame is Pandemic, created by North American designer Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He recalls playing it with friends and feeling scared but excited, wanting to create a similar experience.

Leacock's love for board games started in childhood. He often felt disappointed with games, so with his uncle's help, he began designing better ones. Pandemic became very successful, and its sequel added more storytelling, similar to video games where characters develop and rules change.

Interestingly, the growth of video games has helped board games become popular. Video games have made playing games normal for many people. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, says, ""Everyone with a smartphone plays at least one game. More people are open to playing games now.""

Video games once offered social interaction in arcades or with friends at home. But as online multiplayer games grew, players became physically distant. Some people missed playing games with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, these games offer a way to connect in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many setbacks. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. Growing up, he only listened to a local radio station for middle-aged people, which influenced his musical taste. He didn't hear a modern song until he was 12. Around that time, he had to choose between playing tennis at a national level and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room, playing the piano. Although he was good at tennis, he realized it wasn't what he wanted to do for the rest of his life because it was too much hard work.

At 17, Jamie left school to pursue a career in music. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as passionate about a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to be a musician, explaining that he wrote lyrics during economics lessons and played the piano while others played outside. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Jamie found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he switched to another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune didn't come. He felt that in his artist career, he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, he was in the right place. Writing for others became his strength. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK, helping new artists start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that aiming for chart success is not something to be ashamed of. He asks them, ""Don't you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?"" He believes in writing songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well.

Jamie is straightforward about wanting to write hit songs that reach number one. He doesn't come across as arrogant; he simply knows he has a talent for writing hits. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goal. When he works in the studio, he aims to create music that is globally successful and the best of the next year. It's not just about being trendy; he wants to write classic modern pop songs."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online but might be unknown to people who don't watch videos of bike stunts. He is a 'street trials cyclist,' which means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. 

When I met him for an interview at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, many local boys recognized him immediately. Even older people came to show their admiration, calling him a 'legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed with them. I was impressed by his bravery and creativity, even though I was skeptical at first. Before each stunt, he explained what he planned to do, and I often doubted he could succeed. But he always did, and when I praised him, he seemed uninterested and a bit down. 

Despite his online fame, Tony doesn't enjoy being a celebrity. He finds it hard to interact socially and prefers doing things rather than talking about them. This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and the technology that allows him to share his videos. He acknowledges that this technology helps him make a living, but he feels uncomfortable with how much people focus on screens and cameras. 

Tony earns a good income from his videos, which would have been just a hobby in the past. From my experience interviewing top athletes, I know that two key factors make a child become an elite athlete: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. These are often more important than talent and help athletes keep going despite failures. In risky sports, mental strength is crucial. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on obstacles that were easy for him but new. He simply got up and tried again until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he is reckless and takes unnecessary risks. Tony responds that these critics don't understand the sport and have probably never ridden a trials bike. They don't know the technical details or that he gets expert advice to minimize risks. Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He believes it's important to be aware of dangers. Some people never feel scared, but Tony feels fear and finds a way to overcome it. He is not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning and preparing. Sometimes he needs to ride around to get in the right mindset before trying a new stunt. He knows he must stay calm and fully commit to the jump to succeed."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. Her latest challenge was walking on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, just a belt around her waist connected to another wire above her. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found high-wire walking to be very different. ""The training was a shock,"" Helen said. ""I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she said afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole using skis, a kite, and a bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about traveling around Canada in a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which gave him a serious fever. He was stuck in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for hospital bills or to get back home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that lets us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night, because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat. The work is tough. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but often it is wet. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a lab, where we will analyze our results together. It will be hard to be indoors, but it is necessary. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is crucial to ensure that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from my company. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for our chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I test and taste the products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues, which makes them happy! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to work in during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm in our food lab, and other times I'm traveling abroad to buy raw materials. This can be challenging because I have a young family. However, I love the variety and lack of routine in my job, although the chocolate itself is still my favorite part! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!'"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many different skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things such as balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves swinging through the air in front of an amazed audience. During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. 

Sophia explains that for a circus career, performers need to avoid repeating the same acts – it's important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to succeed in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part of the circus is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is crucial, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or only work a few months each year. But the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel with the circus while you're young, and then you need to think about other career options.

The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that it's not a job for making a lot of money! ""The work usually means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive – but a lot of fun!"""
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you've probably heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the main singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers, but that's not true. They often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the true stars of the music industry! 

""What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes it's a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job!""

""Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There's often no sheet music to look at. I'll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, plus an orchestra. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording sessions are long enough already.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always know which musical range is best for the female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it."""
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion. She created a successful company selling 'satchels,' which are traditional school bags. These bags are now sold in famous stores and are popular with celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She chose satchels even though many people doubted there was a market for them. Julie was confident in her choice.

From the beginning, Julie involved her family in the business. She worked with her mother, who had no previous career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children's storybooks. Although Julie was not familiar with fashion blogs, they played a crucial role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel per week. To generate interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would mention them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her products grew, as did the speed of production.

Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity will be spotted with a satchel next. Instead of spending money on online advertising, she uses feedback from the internet community to create new and exciting styles. There was a difficult period when another company copied her satchel design. This experience taught her to trust her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors to her office often comment on the positive atmosphere, and employees enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, but Julie believes it is the team that makes the workplace special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with her schoolwork. 

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Fortunately, I found a new career.’

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a larger group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people doubt whether celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it to promote themselves, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Ana Ronson, a singer-songwriter, grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but music was always present in her home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. Ana first sang in front of an audience at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to build her confidence. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert and felt happy doing it. 

A year later, Ana's brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" in just three days and enjoyed the process so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest in the class, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher didn't listen to her, so she wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about her frustration. She posted it online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened.

Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled across Ireland to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn't know much about the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. Joss assured her this wouldn't happen, and soon after, she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and the evening was a great success.

Ana prefers writing songs about difficult times rather than when life is good because she feels there's more to express. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision,"" which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes her fans enjoy her music, her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an incredible trip. I joined a guided group tour by boat along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry's idea. Like me, he is a journalist, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. Harry loves boats, but I don't share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew our great-grandparents had lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we planned to visit. Fortunately, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy with work and didn't have much time to prepare, but Harry assured me he had taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide told us that very few people lived along that coast. On the first morning, the only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. There were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see them. I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of amazing, colorful fish, many of which I didn't recognize. It was wonderful not to worry about time. We always made lunch and dinner together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. Even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life!

When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. As a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many games would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. It took some time for me to agree, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. Having my mom and dad watch made me nervous, but it turned out fine in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't enjoy being far from my parents at first. At home, I couldn't spend much time with friends because of all the training, so that part didn't change much. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I considered different options and decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, making it feel new every time. After finishing my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that to get a license, I needed to know a lot more than I already did. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging months, I earned my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent guide. 

Being a tour guide isn't just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group. You also need to be entertaining, tell interesting stories, and handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour without hearing about problems. I need to ensure visitors are happy with my tours because they might leave reviews online. Good reviews are important as they attract more customers. That's why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy usually result in very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I’m 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. However, we didn’t need to worry. 

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so collecting this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard, but seeing the elephants enjoy their food made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants! 

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. We chose this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn’t include meat, which we both prefer to avoid. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we’re back in the UK, Josie doesn’t talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she’s being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she realizes how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she’ll return one day – I definitely will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people for their friends or homes; we have many different customers. Hotels and offices often want flowers for their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often colder and darker than I'd like, but that's normal for that time of the morning, so I don't mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I'd probably only pick pink ones because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what customers want can be different. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can't find what customers want.

I don't enjoy arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it's part of the job. Flowers aren't cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we make flower arrangements and calculate the cost of orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy figuring out how to create the best flower arrangements for the money someone wants to spend. That's what you have to do when you're selling things, and I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest movies I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It's close to where I live. However, a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to talk about a movie in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we pick a different place in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a movie set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We’re happy just to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still a lot to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say they had a great time, it’s wonderful. The website has been very helpful, and we’re now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We’ve visited to see how others do things – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog too, because we know most people now go online for movie information, rather than reading reviews in local newspapers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. However, nothing works as well as word of mouth – people recommending us to their friends. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month, we had a movie quiz, which everyone enjoyed."
71,"As a child, I loved taking photographs. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I started a special project: taking one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my work to others. I was surprised to find that people liked my photos and the way I saw things. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then, someone suggested that my project would be better if all the photos had a common theme. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing, as they mostly took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost quit, but I trusted my instincts and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher, who told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project was important to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough for a career. Now, I have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted choosing this path."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new things like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can do different activities to push yourself and learn new skills. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called 'leaders' run them. When you finish a level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure about it because I had been to that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other kids already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. 

After I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made great connections with the children. Now, I volunteer there for about four hours a week and always look forward to it. Because of my experience at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about this career before joining the club. 

This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I’ve earned several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I did well. After that, I quickly grew to love snowboarding and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but I love competing and winning, which motivates me to try harder. I like not having a fixed plan. This worked well when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn't sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I started. This success made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying because there is no snow. I train every day, but I don't have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. This helps me cope with not being able to snowboard, which I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also want to have another option in case I don't succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I'm considering becoming a doctor if I can find time for college. I can't imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can't do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I didn't think about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I'm grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I saw my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could try it. I was surprised at how easy it was, even though it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it was boring, but I was excited about it. Mum showed me how to make beautiful things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewelry to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. I needed to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewelry to take home as gifts. Soon, we got calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but it was just the two of us at a market stall! That's when I realized it could work, and it was time to create a website. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called ""Being Amelia,"" which became a bestseller. The book is partly inspired by Janine's own life. In an interview, Janine explained that because her father's job required the family to move frequently, she became skilled at making new friends. This experience helped her write about Amelia, the main character, adjusting to a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia's home life, especially her interactions with her older brother. Since Janine is an only child, she had to use her imagination to write those parts.

Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it felt natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she had won first prize in a short story competition on a young writers' website. This success made the publishing company eager to read her novel when she sent it to them. They loved it, and a year later, ""Being Amelia"" was available in bookstores.

A review of ""Being Amelia"" notes that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters in the story face real challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer says that although Janine is young and the novel isn't very long, she has shown she is a better writer than many bestselling authors.

Janine is still getting used to being famous. She said, ""At first, I hid when people recognized me on the street, but now it's OK. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, spending time with my friends gives me new ideas to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen, and three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. This happened because my dad got a job as the castle's manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for people to visit. He was happy about the job because he thought he might not get such a great opportunity again. It took some time for the rest of us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home across the water, and there was no school on the island. But after we moved, we quickly got used to living there. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment inside it is comfortable. In the summer, the island feels lively because many visitors come, and there are often beach parties. In the winter, we only see the other families living on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers as I had hoped. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which can be hard work. The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days with big waves, but the ferries don't run then! I've learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is a problem. So when friends come to stay with me, I always tell them to hurry up! But we often see amazing views, like the sunset over the sea. Some days, it's so foggy you can't see anything, and then a few hours later, it's sunny again – it's still surprising when that happens, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle is strong enough to avoid damage. But then I remind myself it's been here for centuries – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I've always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best spots to see them. It was amazing, and after we returned home, I joined a local young birdwatchers' club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I'm almost there. During family holidays abroad, I've had the chance to see birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities so I can add new birds to my list! I've been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I wasn't too disappointed when it didn't happen because I've learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it interesting and commented that it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I wasn't nervous until just before I was introduced and walked onto the stage. I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I'm lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn't have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a pretty good player. However, my family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13. After that, I got much better. Even so, people still doubted I’d become a star player, which made me a bit upset. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me if we lost. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to believe they could play for a top team if they’re willing to work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few bad times, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"In recent years, both in the UK and internationally, there has been a trend in higher education to involve students in research early in their studies. This shift acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists making big discoveries. Instead, research is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. These skills are valuable not only in academics but also in the workplace, as they help us understand the world and improve our work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge by creating it, not just by learning and repeating it. This involves asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are the foundation of research. Research can range from groundbreaking studies by experts to everyday inquiries that involve careful planning and questioning of issues and practices.

Most students have been researchers in some way, whether in school projects or everyday tasks like planning a holiday or fixing things at home. In college, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, and critically evaluating information are key learning activities. However, some students might find this challenging, especially if they come from cultures where knowledge is seen as fixed and learned from authority figures like teachers and textbooks.

In places like the UK, US, and much of Europe and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authority is encouraged. This can be intimidating, but critical thinking is crucial in research. We need to engage with others' research, think critically about it, and test its validity. It's important not to accept information blindly but to assess whether it is logical and supported by evidence."
80,"Cities have always been places where people come together to share ideas. In the 18th century, London’s coffee houses were popular spots for discussing topics like chemistry and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. However, living in a city can be difficult. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities are great for creativity, they can also be stressful and unnatural places to live.

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. We’ve known for a long time that living in a city can be tiring, but new research shows that it can also make our thinking less sharp. One major issue is the lack of nature in cities. Studies have shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can help our brains because they give us a break from the busy city life.

This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people now live in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into crowded urban areas with millions of strangers. This unnatural environment affects our mental and physical health and changes how we think. Walking down a busy city street, our brains have to deal with many distractions: other pedestrians, traffic, and the complex layout of the city. These tasks use up a lot of our brain’s energy because we have to constantly decide what to pay attention to and what to ignore.

In contrast, natural environments don’t require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can help restore our ability to focus. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Long before scientists studied these effects, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the negative impact of city life and looked for ways to bring nature into cities. Urban parks, like Central Park in New York, offer people a break from city life. A well-designed park can quickly improve brain function. While people have tried many ways to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or changing office layouts, simply walking in nature seems to be one of the most effective methods.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain centers of intellectual activity. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that can make us lose focus, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The high level of social interaction in cities is a big reason for their creativity. Just as 18th-century London’s crowded environment led to new ideas, today’s busy cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are successful creative hubs.

The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. After all, there are times when people crave the excitement of the city, even if they miss the peace of nature."
81,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious to say that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain-scanning technology to support this idea. However, I believe that the study of the mind shouldn't be limited to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in how we think. Archaeology shows us that things like stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and shaping our minds. So, I suggest that what is outside our heads might still be part of our minds.

It's easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their usual surroundings. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limitations of brain-scanning machines. But this approach often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny that the brain is crucial for thinking, but I want to highlight that the mind is more than just the brain. It might be more useful to consider that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into our culture and the material world.

This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become extensions of our minds or are integrated into our bodies. For example, when we make numbers and symbols out of clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also looks at how these interactions have changed over time and what they mean for our thinking. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they are shaped by the things around us.

Consider a blind person using a stick. Where does this person's sense of self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be continuous. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: the stick helps the blind person turn touch into sight, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence is adaptable and can change significantly by incorporating new technologies.

I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, the 'stick'—whether it was a stone tool or the internet—has served as a pathway for humans to explore and understand the world, not as a boundary. This is different from how a monkey uses a stick to get food. For humans, 'sticks' help satisfy our curiosity. This unique human tendency to engage with material culture explains why we create things and how those things shape our minds.

I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world. I want to include materiality in our understanding of cognition. MET provides a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern smartphones, have defined and transformed who we are and how we think. While mind-changing technology might sound futuristic, humans have been using it since we first evolved."
82,"Photography has greatly influenced civilization and how we understand the world, especially in the United States. In the U.S., photography quickly became a part of culture at all levels, from practical and scientific uses to industrial and artistic ones. It also brought new forms of entertainment with the invention of the camera. Historians argue that photography is perhaps the U.S.'s most significant contribution to the visual arts, more so than any other art form. This highlights how photography has become central to U.S. intellectual and artistic discussions, and to fully appreciate its impact, we need to look at its origins in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so attractive? First, because it was a mechanical process, it fit well with the growing interest in technology in the U.S., where change was seen as a normal part of life. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world feel smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with stunning immediacy. Second, the camera was the preferred tool for representing oneself, allowing people to create and share images in a country where personal and national identities were always evolving. Third, the camera played a crucial role in creating and preserving family memories, even if these were somewhat idealized. Lastly, the realistic nature of photographs matched the U.S. artists' tendency towards realism and depicting everyday life. 

A photograph draws attention to what the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""This, you should see!"" Because a photograph is made by a machine, it serves as a record of events, people, or things, providing a sense of objectivity. However, since it is taken by an individual, it also carries a personal perspective, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, leading to the idea of photography as a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph is more complex. No image is shown to us without some context that affects our understanding, like a newspaper caption, a magazine layout, or its placement in a gallery or book. To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and role in its cultural context: Why did the photographer take it? How was it first seen? The same image can appear in different places and times, changing its meaning each time.

For a long time, the camera's importance to artists was not widely acknowledged, but now it is well recognized. Since the time of U.S. artist Andy Warhol, who used photographs in his paintings, silk screens, and other works, artists have been incorporating photographs into their art in various ways. In summary, photographic vision has become an essential part of art history, not opposing painting but complementing it, and is crucial to our understanding of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea of what this means. However, even though we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it is still a complex concept. James, like most psychologists, was mainly interested in human psychology. He believed it included basic elements: thoughts and feelings, a physical world in time and space, and a way to understand these things. Our knowledge of these is personal and private, coming from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It might be influenced by scientific facts, but often it is not. This personal understanding makes us feel like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex psychological topics, like brainwashing or why people behave in certain ways, such as feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems occur when people have different understandings. Formal psychology tries to find methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in a situation. Psychologists help us tell the difference between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and scientific facts. Psychology, as James defined it, is about the mind or brain. Psychologists study the brain, but they do not fully understand how it affects our hopes, fears, and behaviors. It is hard to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming ideas about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not directly observable like an engine's. We can only infer them from behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, using clues from careful observation and analysis. Complex interactions are common in psychology, and understanding them requires advanced techniques and theories. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or change the processes it studies. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply conclusions to real life. Psychological findings have been useful in many areas, like teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people communicate their feelings better. Although people have discussed psychological questions for centuries, scientific investigation began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or reflecting on one's own conscious experience, to answer questions. They aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today. However, introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of brain activity. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a typical business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum is like a graveyard for consumer goods that didn’t succeed in the market. Here, you can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were taken off the shelves because almost no one wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople who created it.

What’s surprising about the museum is that it exists as a profitable business. You might think that companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but many don’t. Executives visit the museum regularly, showing how rare it is for companies to keep track of their failures. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, began collecting new products in the 1960s to create a ‘reference library,’ not specifically a collection of failures. However, since most products fail, his collection naturally became filled with unsuccessful items.

Today’s culture of optimism might explain why these failed products exist. Each product likely went through many meetings where no one realized it was doomed. Even if they did, marketers might have continued investing in the product to force some sales and save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and people involved often avoid discussing it.

This focus on optimism is common in the growing ‘self-help’ industry. A popular method is ‘positive visualization,’ which suggests that imagining success makes it more likely to happen. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot has found evidence that our brains might be wired to be overly optimistic. Her research shows that well-balanced people often have an unrealistic, positive view of their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen has studied whether ‘positive fantasies about the future’ are effective. Her research shows that thinking too much about success can actually reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people who imagined having a successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a ‘fixed theory’ mindset think ability is innate and find failure distressing because it shows they didn’t measure up. In contrast, those with an ‘incremental theory’ believe ability grows with effort and see failure as a chance to improve. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger after being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, regardless of success."
85,"Sports teams often have an advantage when playing at home, but the reasons for this are not entirely clear. Traditionally, people believed that playing at home helped teams perform better, but changes in professional sports have led to questions about this belief. Two main factors challenging this idea are science and money. Sports scientists are exploring what helps players perform at their best, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. On the other hand, financial interests question if home advantage should matter, as well-paid players should perform well anywhere.

Fans play a role in this discussion. For example, if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East, it might upset British fans who believe their support is crucial for the team's success. Fans often think their cheering leads to goals, but they forget the times when their support didn't result in success. However, scientific studies show that home fans can influence referees. In an experiment, referees who watched a match with crowd noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team compared to those who watched in silence. This suggests referees might avoid decisions that would anger the home crowd.

Research shows that home advantage has decreased over time in major sports, but it still exists. In the 1890s, home teams in England's Football League won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar. Despite these changes, home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the highest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because basketball relies more on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home.

Another factor could be players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This might be linked to a natural instinct to defend home territory. In the Rugby World Cup, underdog teams playing at home won against stronger opponents, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"""The more I practise, the luckier I get,"" said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is valued by athletes and coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with claims that other golfers might have said it. The meaning is also not straightforward. Player didn't mean actual luck; he meant that practice makes you better. This idea connects to the nature-nurture debate: is talent something you're born with, or can it be developed? 

In this debate, nurture, or practice, has been seen as more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson suggested that becoming an expert in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice. This idea was popularized by Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Outliers"" and others like ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" These books argue that practice is the key to success, and that 10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert.

However, in his book, Epstein challenges this idea. He shows through many examples that practice alone is not always enough. He points out that studies often focus only on successful people, which can be misleading. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others don't, looking at factors like environment, support, and determination. His research takes him around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to the Arctic.

In Alaska, Epstein learns that in a tough sled dog race, the huskies' drive and desire are crucial, suggesting that both genes and environment play a role. This challenges the idea that commitment and determination are just choices. What if, as with the huskies, an individual's drive also has a genetic component?

Epstein talks about the complexity of talent, distinguishing between ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture). He agrees that both are important for elite athletes. He doesn't dismiss the role of training or environment, suggesting that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. But Epstein also shows cases where genetics are very important.

He also discusses race and gender, asking why men and women compete separately in sports if practice is all that matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most important."
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature. She believes this is the main problem. This idea is supported by other discussions about modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could spend more time outside. People over 40 often remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they spent time exploring outdoors, which they believe was healthier than the way children live today. However, they don't often realize that they are the ones who have created the protective environment for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book includes strong arguments. She discusses how fear of outdoor dangers and consumerism are connected. Parents' fears keep children indoors, which benefits the toy and gadget industry. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. While some of these rules might be exaggerated, Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly. She also talks about childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules. Although her arguments are interesting, Griffiths sometimes takes them too far. She ignores important counter-arguments and even compares modern treatment of children to racism, which seems extreme.

Griffiths is very idealistic about children. She mostly sees them in a positive light, which might not match the reality of dealing with energetic young kids. She believes children are naturally creative thinkers, but this might not be true for all. The main idea of her book is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. She argues that children need small accidents to learn how to handle bigger risks later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children might want the adventurous life she describes. Some children are naturally more cautious and prefer staying indoors. The real issue might be forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I've spent a lot of time in school. I'm good at solving problems in my work and life, but this isn't because of my schooling. Most life problems can't be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play. Those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, moral lives can't be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is crucial for economic success. We don't need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate obstacles, we'll have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We can't teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling focused on imposed questions with one right answer. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring for them, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit. If you can't quit, it's not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue the game. This makes play the most democratic activity. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and pressure for high grades has grown. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults present have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They result from social factors like parents' fears, expert warnings about dangers, declining neighborhood cohesion, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children don't need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They need to follow their natural drives to play and explore to grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to directly contact potential employers, which used to be possible only by standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, this increased access also means more chances to make mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the jobseeker hoped they could help him get a job. But the executive was not pleased. She was upset that a stranger expected her to share her valuable contacts and sent him a harsh rejection note, which went viral online. Many people who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone, even if not the message. However, this incident might help young people think more carefully about using social media professionally. It highlights that social media can be risky for job seekers who don't know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes.

There's an irony here because social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of people in their twenties for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was like an online playground where we could impress others and try new things. It was often based on fantasy. You could chat with someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. By choosing certain pictures or songs for your Facebook page, you could become a different, more interesting person overnight. And if you didn't want to talk, you could just ""poke"" people on Facebook.

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. For some people in their twenties, this difference is not clear. We first became known online by being bold and confident, which might explain why some of us still think this is a good approach. Just because many people ""liked"" your Facebook posts doesn't mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you're worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn't apply anymore. We must meet employers' standards if we want to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too informal and seem arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of our generation as ""entitled."" In reality, many of us are desperate to find jobs, which is why we turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt the job prospects of young people who, despite their communication mistakes, have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending generic emails and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it requires careful handling to avoid negative outcomes."
90,"Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If you look at the numbers, it seems like newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001, according to the Pew Research Centre. Many people predict that printed newspapers will disappear in about 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. For example, in 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were outdated, but both have survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived even with TV, and cinema has stayed popular despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales increasing by 745% since 2008.

Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph, which made it possible to produce and distribute news widely. Another important factor was the idea that everything is constantly changing, and people need regular updates, a concept that was not common in medieval times. Back then, people only noticed the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life was seen as cyclical, with recurring truths, as writer Alain de Botton explains.

Journalism as a full-time job only became common in the 19th century. Even then, there was no clear reason why people needed news regularly. The regular publication of newspapers can be limiting. Online news allows readers to check updates as they see fit. Advanced search engines and algorithms let us customize news to our interests. Online news can provide minute-by-minute updates, correct errors quickly, and offer detailed analysis without space limits. This is very different from traditional newspapers.

However, many online news providers focus on being the first to report news, encouraging reader comments, and creating excitement, which can lead to confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. In some ways, we are returning to that environment. Newspapers have not always been great at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction, or they might find a way to help us understand the world better, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic universe, as de Botton suggests."
91,"If humans were truly comfortable under the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many night-active animals do. However, we are creatures of the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a fundamental part of our genetics, even if we don't often think of ourselves as day creatures, just like we don't constantly think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This explains why we have changed the night by filling it with light. We've engineered the night to suit us, similar to how we control rivers with dams. This control has benefits but also leads to problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just beginning to study. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, where artificial light shines into the sky instead of focusing downward. This bad lighting brightens the night, changing the natural light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would have been meaningless. Imagine approaching London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's largest city. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and public gaslights wouldn't appear for another seven years. From a few miles away, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We've lit up the night as if it were empty, but that's not true. Many mammals are active at night. Light is a strong biological force and attracts many species. This attraction is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds are 'captured' by searchlights or gas flares, flying around them until they fall. Birds migrating at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, with young birds on their first journey being most affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd times when exposed to artificial light. It was once thought that light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need a clear night sky. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need a perfect view of the night sky for work, but like most creatures, we need darkness. Ignoring the need for darkness is pointless. Darkness is as important for our health as light. Changing our natural rhythms can cause health problems. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping reflects the Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so essential that disrupting them is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs near a bright highway. Living in our own bright world, we have disconnected from our evolutionary and cultural roots—the stars and the natural day-night cycle. Light pollution makes us lose our sense of place in the universe and forget our true scale, which is best understood under a deep night sky with the Milky Way above."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his company will stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This idea was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by someone from his media team. While the announcement might seem like an attempt to make the company look more caring, we should ask: is this idea practical?

The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn't harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work better. In a large company, it's harder to be sure that taking time off won't cause problems.

The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team projects are up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? Even if you prepare well before a holiday, there will always be work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works. If employees follow these rules, they might not take any leave at all or feel guilty about it. Feeling guilty can lead to stress, and not taking enough leave can reduce productivity over time.

There could also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who takes time off and for how long. This pressure already affects decisions like when to start and end the workday. In the corporate world, there's a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. Without the security of guaranteed leave, people might feel they can't take the time off they need because they don't want to seem lazy. They wouldn't have their legal right to leave to rely on.

The policy might make employees feel stuck, unable to take their leave, or they might just stick to their legal rights, making the policy pointless. Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, anywhere, blurring the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wondered how this new way of working fit with the old time-off rules. If the company can't track work hours accurately, why should it use an outdated standard for time off?

However, if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being watched, making them monitor themselves, which could be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits like increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can happen without affecting worker well-being. I doubt that letting employees ""take as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts in a field review a scientific paper before it is published. This is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research, acting as a filter to stop flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often reassure the public and media about its importance. However, reviewing can delay publication by up to a year, raising the question of whether this delay is worth it to ensure trustworthy research. The answer is both yes and no, as the world of scientific publishing is changing.

I still believe in some form of peer review before formal publication, but things are shifting. Preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review, are becoming more common. They allow for quick sharing of new results, which can then be read, critiqued, and built upon by others. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which can lead to authors cutting corners to get published in top journals. Reviewers now often focus on whether a paper is suitable for a journal rather than its quality. This can depend on how newsworthy a paper is, not just its scientific value.

These issues are well-known, but few are willing to change the current system. However, preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a big change from the norm. Although preprints have been around for twenty years, they are not widely used. This is partly because scientists are conservative and because there is a misconception that journals won't accept papers that have been posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review could lead to 'junk science,' but this hasn't happened yet. Authors know that preprints are open to critique by a global community.

Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper critiqued another published paper, which is difficult to do in traditional journals. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and all discussions were open for readers to see. This transparency allows readers to judge the quality of the arguments. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments are still available, so the work isn't wasted.

Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also be a place to share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing their effectiveness in spreading information. By using the internet's openness and the collaborative spirit of the scientific community, preprints can help focus attention on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say it's like ""a painting in words."" These answers usually don't satisfy either of us. So, one day, I asked them to pick an object and write two paragraphs: one describing it like a scientist would, and another from the object's perspective, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote:

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I'm a device that helps people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and even then, only for a short time. Most people will never need me.

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and sparked a lot of discussion. When I was in school, poetry often seemed confusing to me. I thought of each poem as a silly puzzle that blocked true understanding and feeling. After school, many people find poetry less and less engaging. Sometimes you come across a poem, and it stands out because it's not like regular prose. It almost challenges you to read it, and often, you feel let down by its simplicity or because it’s hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we expect from poems? Aren’t they supposed to be full of deep emotions, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem to be yes. But if we want to cry, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to different worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. Yet, a poem can offer something unique: ambiguity. Everyday life is full of it, unlike straightforward reading. But these thoughts still don’t explain what a poem really is.

If you search online for ""poem,"" it leads you to ""poetry,"" described as a form of art using the beauty and rhythm of language. This is academic language, but it hides the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek ""poí?ma,"" meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things."" So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – precise and human-made – depending on their view. But these comparisons don't hold up under scrutiny. The value in comparing a poem to something else is not in the comparison itself but in the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps the mind explore new ways of thinking and see ordinary things differently.

Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially when we consider how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, staring at you: A poem can make a strong impact like nothing else, even though, as ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it never really becomes a commodity. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make a profit. A poem presents itself not as something for sale, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been wiser to spend it on something useful for the house. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has made me happy because it connects me to the past. But after finding the gold ring, it took 40 years to make another discovery that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, intricately designed loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. I called Marion and said, ""I've got something for you."" She came in, stopped, and asked, ""What is it?"" I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been burgled, but I was anxious, so I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says you must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask me, ""Now that you've found something amazing, are you going to stop detecting?"" But those brooches and coins are still interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing—he keeps going, hoping for an even bigger catch tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during sudden Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in comfortable Italian beds. Sleeping better is a nice bonus of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. Even though there were noisy birds nearby, it didn't bother me. Away from home, in a new place with different smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and have vivid dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I don't think just relaxing explains why travel sleep feels so different. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. We take in new cultures, music, landscapes, and even ways of moving. During sleep, we process all this new information. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with each place we visit. People often worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep patterns. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all felt sleepy and lay down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I didn't just sleep; I shared a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is also memorable. Being in a different place with new smells, textures, and sounds makes sleep special. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity of all. Maybe I should stop feeling guilty and tell my friends that travel sleep is an important part of the experience too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror and asked, ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said diplomatically to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking a bit like a bulldog. ""But it's so boring,"" she complained. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black mini top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she decided, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change the woman's mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. 

Mia thought about her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, Tattie, whom they knew nothing about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia's husband, Jeff, had questioned the name. ""Tattie,"" he said, ""What sort of name is that?"" Mia explained, ""It's short for Tatiana. I think it’s nice."" Jeff, who disliked anything showy, replied, ""It sounds affected."" He also didn't like Mia's tendency to be overly polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat, maybe even saying a dustbin lid would suit her better. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good.""

An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. Her commute was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew there was, as her friends often complained about finding the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. After Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women traveled from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where they could try on as many hats as they wanted in a relaxed setting. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure everything matched. Recently, she expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"Lawrence Okoye has come a long way from London to Atlanta. In his new American home, he reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident, but even he is surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Despite never playing American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen by a top team in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still learning the details of his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be selected for a top American sports team seems unbelievable. But Lawrence is used to proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but delayed it to focus on discus, after playing rugby. In just 20 months, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, aiming for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in a big NFL contract, he says, ""American football was always in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I had thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then."" Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ""Pretty much,"" he says. ""I went online and applied."" Was he nervous about competing with experienced players? ""No,"" he says. ""I don’t get nervous about many things."" He doesn’t talk much, but he clearly believes in himself. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ""I was very pleased to hear that,"" he admits, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is also cautious. He knows he lacks experience. How can someone so new to the sport make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have all the qualities needed. It’s just about how hard I work,"" he explains. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he’s been selected? ""I am. There’s no pressure on me. Many people think I’ll be chosen, but I’m not too worried."" This calm attitude might come from his disappointing Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved past this and is proud he made it to the final with an impressive last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he recalls. ""The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sport. I can always return to it."" After the Olympics, some thought the experience had affected him negatively. Lawrence doesn’t comment on this. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his great physical abilities, wouldn’t it be better to focus on one sport? ""I understand why someone might say that,"" he replies. ""I’m trying to achieve something I dreamed of as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been well thought out."""
99,"We had been flying east all night, and when I woke up, it was already daylight. Looking out the window, I saw the vast, empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, winter hadn't started in Siberia yet. There was no sign of human life, just an endless view of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head in disbelief. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow traveling to remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I managed to explain that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he reasoned, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it anymore. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend named Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and said one word, ""Holodna"" (cold), pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I didn't mention that my trip was self-funded and I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at discounted prices. In reality, I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman's over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. That morning, the hall was full of students slumped in their seats, some taking notes without much energy. The lecturer droned on, and I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job ticked many important boxes for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: cycling around the world. Ever since that first ride we took together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times, he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could handle each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the skeptics who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through a series of tall pylons, which are between 15 and 25 meters high. They have to make sharp turns, do barrel rolls, and loops, all while flying at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to participate in this race. 

An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first one confirmed that I was in good health, and the second one was to ensure I emptied my pockets because small objects can become dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I needed to stay oriented during the flight. I was told, ""The horizon is your best friend,"" and the pilot would tell me where to look. I was also asked to promise that when flying upside down, I would ""completely relax and try to enjoy the view.""

Half an hour before the flight, I attended a safety briefing where I was told not to touch anything under any circumstances. By the time we were moving down the runway, with my legs up and trying not to touch the important steering pedals, and my hands avoiding the many switches, I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the tricky part of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you have to stay calm and focused. You need to tense up at the right time and relax at the right time. Panicking is not a good idea. None of this was comforting as we started speeding down the runway.

Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes in the world. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we made a sharp right turn. It was a sudden, intense move, and I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I felt like I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We made another sharp left turn and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs feeling compressed. Seconds later, we were flying 10 meters above the ground, heading for the small gap between two pylons. They passed by at 400 km per hour, but my brief excitement was interrupted by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even started the acrobatics yet.

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand was shaking so much that the plane shook too—it’s that sensitive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was a bit too much. At the top of the loop, while flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience during a race. To show this, Dario took out some sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily ate them. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed of doing loops over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you've ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. He says his ideal temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned how to survive in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. 'I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.' He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. 'I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had people who specialized in coral, elephants, chimpanzees. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.' The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. 'It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.' 'My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.' Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. 'We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera's locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye's very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She's looking at me but she's not bothered. I've just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can't get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I'd swear it's partly in sheer pleasure,' he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. 'Clearly it's their first view of the world … It's show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.' Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim through freezing waters and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even more challenging expedition. Explorers are confident and determined people, and they need to be. This time, there is much more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer journey to the North Pole, measuring the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tough by sending him out into blizzards and icy winds with very few clothes. His father shared a love of icy adventures with him, and Pen showed unusual physical strength. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he’s at home because he’s often thinking about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horseback compete against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he admits. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I thought it would be a good idea to say to my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He absolutely took it to heart, asking his mum how she was all the time, but the strain eventually became too much. While it was well intentioned, it was an unfair thing to do.’ For similar reasons he is planning to have very little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending these last days before departure preparing his kit, obsessively. ‘Out on the ice, one is virtually incapable of mending things or doing anything that isn’t absolutely straightforward,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, one of the world’s leading polar explorers, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will be supported by a crew of six, flying in supplies. Being part of a team is actually more stressful to someone with his mentality, says Pen, and something else is on his mind too. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done far less training than I’m comfortable with.’ Why? ‘Organisational things always seem more urgent. So I’m almost fearful of what I’m going to ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. ‘Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition,’ he admits, ‘and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we’re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and nobody can do it but us,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which are otherwise bizarre and socially redundant, have become hyper-relevant. Suddenly, we’re socially useful again.’"
103,"I took a year off and wondered what to do next. Being an Olympian is amazing, and I had opportunities to write, work on TV, and speak at schools and businesses. Although these activities were interesting, I missed having a competitive challenge. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to compete in the Olympics again, so I started running marathons and doing triathlons. But there was still Ben Fogle's invitation in my mind: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed the feeling of the boat gliding through the water, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. I knew if I joined, I would want to win, even though it was more of an adventure. I wasn't sure if Ben was the best partner to win with, but the idea of being an underdog was appealing. 

Ben was already planning to do the race and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the remaining costs, which were high, with the boat and equipment alone costing £70,000. We thought we had a good chance, but it would require effort to secure everything. Besides the race expenses, I also had to consider the loss of income from being away. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete, and it's nice that people are interested. However, I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would give me something current to talk about: rowing across the Atlantic.

Planning this adventure taught me to appreciate the simpler life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but straightforward, with set training programs and support from doctors and dieticians. I was worried about how people would react to me racing with a TV presenter, thinking it might seem like I just wanted to be on TV. But during our preparations, my concerns faded. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about mental strength than just rowing skills. Ben had done tough challenges before, like the Marathon des Sables and spending time at sea and on a deserted island. However, he wasn't a natural rower, and I was surprised by his lack of skill. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have expected his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless and dreamed of the cold, empty Arctic landscapes, maybe as a reaction to the noisy, crowded life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they have many tourists who want sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to over 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm', which they said was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I understood what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away.

November 6, London On my flight, I try to memorize the names of over 100 huskies, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the list down and look out the window instead. People say that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of blooming flowers and leaves. But I feel like I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus ride north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests of thin conifers, heavy with snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrive at the farm after dark and am immediately given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes very loud as I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, harnessing the huskies to sleds. The dogs are almost crazy with excitement, pulling hard against the ropes, eager to go. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much anyway. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I face tough questions about what I can contribute. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m unsure. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, no matter what, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very hard in freezing temperatures. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is full of instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds and being pulled around by eager huskies. But I feel triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the media gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would allow her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended it to help heal injuries from an accident when Radcliffe ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe says the achievement never really felt real to her. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal at the time. However, she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day, so it didn't overwhelm her. She and her team had decided not to set any limits. Their motto was: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Next to him was Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could maintain such a fast pace. He worried it might cause her to drop out of the race. Hartmann was upset by this, although he admitted that anyone who didn't know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to calculate. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers at an incredible speed but still managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" She remembers the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he didn't think anyone would come close to that time for a while. And she thought, ""I'm going to come back and do it next year."" Unfortunately, that didn't happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete with such an awkward running style had beaten the graceful East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks, giving her daily sessions to help with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He says, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle that level of pain. She would push me to go so deep into her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward because I was in so much pain."" Hartmann describes traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no ""Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?"" He had barely arrived, and she was ready for a two-hour session. Paula would push him to give everything he had. That's what made her so good. During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are people who are more talented. I thought it might happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves."" What does she mean? ""That mental approach of never easing up, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me to it because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always: 'keep pushing as hard as you can.'"" Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run as fast again. However, she left a lasting legacy. Many women were inspired to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" was released, I was unsure how viewers and the media would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our show added something new to this movement, but I still worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques, but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other exciting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often very physical, involving travel with passports and suitcases. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet extraordinary people, like a man who dedicates his life to making the best-tasting golden pasta. These people have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was left out. I could imagine people asking, ""Where's steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?"" However, after long discussions, the TV team and I created a list that had something for everyone. This confirmed my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on personal emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book's title, I never claimed the recipes were 'definitive.' But I thought that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying ideas and refining them until they become unique. The TV series allowed me to explore foods, people, and places I had never seen in any restaurant, and I was as excited about that as I was about exploring memory and nostalgia in food because that's how I started in this business. Finding the best ingredients for the recipes took me around the world. Some of my adventures included being taken to a canning factory that processed the wrong type of tomato and visiting a dairy farm with standards so low we had to stop filming. Perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine, and nearly burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a few hours away from Marrakech when the van suddenly made a loud noise and swerved off the road into a field, coming to a stop. John got out and looked under the hood of the van. He stood there for a long time, looking at the engine with his hands in his pockets, pretending to know what he was doing. Finally, he admitted, ""Actually, I have no idea what I'm doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried and said, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was vast, with nothing but grass and lots of flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was always safest to be on her side. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away, getting smaller and smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass and asked me to tell a story. Bea lay down next to her and encouraged me to tell one. So, I told them about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and even an argument over a worm. Bea said, ""That's silly, no one understands bird language."" My eyes stung, and I insisted, ""I do,"" but I didn't sound convincing. ""Liar,"" she said, and I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ""Mum...?"" But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a hotel. Bea refused to get out, but the boys didn't mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back door windows. We followed John into a café near where our van was parked. ""It's a hotel,"" John whispered. ""I think it might be expensive."" ""We'll just have some tea,"" Mum reassured him, and we sat down in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot and said, ""It's like syrup in there."" We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the engine. ""I suppose it's a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum spread blankets on the ground in the hotel garden for us to sleep. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn't moving. ""I'll have to get us towed into Marrakech,"" John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed behind us with John at the wheel. At first, Bea didn't want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home now that our van needed to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike Lucy, they were not competing. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, but Lucy didn't catch her name because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing, their recent travels, and their future plans. 

Lucy mentioned she might be going to the Tanglewood festival that summer, which sounded impressive. However, she didn't really want to go. She often felt this way about the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, causing her to miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. Lucy hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad celebrated by buying her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant, and her little brother Gus dreamed of attending the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. 

The truth was, Lucy hadn't applied to the festival herself. Her mother had filled out the application and sent in a CD. Her mom said she didn't want Lucy to be disappointed if she didn't get in. Lucy thought it was more about not giving her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing she could do, so she didn't even think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo seemed surprised when Lucy mentioned Tanglewood. ""How old are you?"" he asked. ""Fifteen,"" she replied. He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy hadn't meant to show off. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was just fitting in or bragging. ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying..."" she explained. Liesel/Louisa excused herself, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked if Lucy had ever been to Japan. He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were rebels. ""Once. When I was, like, eight,"" Lucy replied. 

Just then, Lucy's grandfather appeared and interrupted. ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,"" he said, pulling her away. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition."" ""They're not the competition,"" Lucy replied. ""Everyone is the competition,"" her grandfather insisted. He took her around the room, making her talk to people he thought were important. Lucy smiled and nodded, only half-listening to what was said.

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather told her, ""You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" Lucy liked that part—being somebody. Even if it meant some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn't earn her any special respect from the kids she used to go to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro perfectly. But in places like this festival, she knew she mattered."
109,"Dad said, ""Spending too much time online isn't good for you. You need to experience the real world."" It's hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about this topic, and it's quite interesting. Research generally shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills needed for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is now a key part of growing up. Teenagers don't just use media occasionally like adults do; they live in it. It's not about whether it's good or bad, but how you use it that matters.

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it's like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, which today's parents did when they were younger. It helps teenagers develop their identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and interact with peers.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson explains that adolescence is a time for asking, ""Who am I?"" Social networking can help develop self-identity by allowing you to share your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are less self-centered than those who don't use social media. He also mentions that social media can be helpful for shy people, as online communication can be more comfortable than face-to-face interactions.

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can be beneficial for quiet individuals with specific interests, as they allow connections with others who share those interests. For example, if only a few people at your school like a certain type of music, you might feel isolated. But finding a group online with similar interests can make you feel more connected.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says that young people who find new interests online, join like-minded networks, and create their own content are truly using the potential of social networks. She believes social networking is becoming a creative force, with teenagers making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are enhancing creativity by allowing photographers to connect, learn, and share images. This can improve employability and be beneficial in the workplace. Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness, so understanding how it works is important. For example, if you create a product and have 1,000 friends on social networks, they could be potential customers. Linking these networks can build your customer base.

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they enter the workforce, agrees Matthews. Many sites offer opportunities to collaborate and share content, which is a valuable 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age."
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they probably don't imagine a long road trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. But my parents had a different idea for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan what many teenagers would consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. Before we left, my parents kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There's probably a good reason for that!""

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. I had some ideas on how to cope, though. With barely enough space left for us in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home for smaller accommodations over the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under some of the darkest, star-filled skies in the country, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way!

The next day, we were up at dawn and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what was to come later in our trip. As we climbed to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dodging construction traffic became normal. We laughed as we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument.

We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common, and park volunteers managed them. Our own close encounter with a bear on the road, and an anxious park ranger, gave us unforgettable memories.

As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its creaky floors and no internet or cell phone service, couldn't dampen our spirits. In exchange, I got to see some of the most beautiful views ever. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic foreign place to find something amazing. It was bittersweet to be home again, but at least I hadn't fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our crazy journey to look through and remember. And I knew that for me, the best memories would be the unplanned, spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay because it was her final year, and she was happy to have the best room at the college, complete with a kitchen and study area, plus free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still keep an eye on Amy.

Rose was moving to her grandmother's house. She only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not very excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn't fully understand why her parents had issues with Daisy, but there had been a disagreement in the past, which meant they spent holidays elsewhere. Rose was ten when she last saw Daisy, but her memories were happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting because Daisy was very social and liked bringing people together. Rose expected to receive dinner invitations, coffee morning requests, and shopping trips soon. This made Rose smile because Daisy was not a typical frail grandmother; she seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play loud music, invite friends over, or go out without always asking for permission. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and she didn't want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood this. Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies, which made Rose very happy. They agreed that trust was important. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them crossed the line, they would talk about it.

Rose had never been a troublemaker. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and basically start her life over. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced at this. At least she knew this was the last time, as she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book was a big achievement because it seemed difficult, and she wasn't interested in other activities like the Olympics. At 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. When she told her former teacher, the teacher was surprised, thinking Charlotte would write a book at 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't see why she should wait to do something she might be good at.

We meet on a winter afternoon at her publisher's office. Even though I knew I was meeting a 15-year-old author, it was still surprising to see a teenager there. Her book is impressive: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except the heroine's age, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations person is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she is independent and confident, with a lively intelligence and a calmness that keeps her grounded.

Charlotte admits she is young and doesn't have all the answers. When I ask about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I can't offer many life lessons to my readers,"" she laughs. ""I don't think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I'm not particularly wise either. I just wanted to explore the theme of taking responsibility.""

She has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in books. She believes there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who lacks social skills. Reading about these types frustrated her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who aren't flawed in some way. Some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers can't know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.""

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy authors explore deep psychological and life themes. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I was capable of it."" However, she appreciates a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which advises that if readers can predict what happens next, the suspense is lost.

Some might think Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get published. Her father's connection in publishing did help get her book read initially. She knows she's lucky because getting a first novel read is tough, no matter the author's age. ""Every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show he knew what he was doing, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump quickly. As he flew into the air, his arms were flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I liked practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it, and I was afraid of being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students would jump, try new tricks, and land in foam pits – not a real introduction to what we’d face on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope gets steep again. If you land in the right zone, you keep moving forward, which is less painful. If you land on the flat, you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body ignore my brain and go fast towards the jump. My legs would almost stop as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body is doing in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, and then I was in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment I felt proud of reaching such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I kept my speed as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed in the right zone. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you're gripping the harness tightly. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There's a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park.

It's interesting that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are such a big industry. To create the excitement and escape people want, there are large teams of creative and maybe slightly cruel engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's actually very challenging. Designers must create the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe, and they need to add new features to keep visitors coming back.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited by the track designs from specialist manufacturers.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it's about quickly switching between different forces so people feel thrown around but safe. It's a fine line between thrilling and uncomfortable.

To create an amazing ride, teams must build a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or the most twists. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, gut instincts, experience, and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that being a thrill-seeker helps designers understand what passengers want and test rides before they open to the public.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add a layer of excitement, like painting an old rollercoaster, but the physical ride experience will remain the most important for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating pieces for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances occasionally. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. She explains, ""Dancing again reminds me of what it's like to be in the studio, taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it's like to rehearse all day."" As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching and working with young students. ""A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want success but don't fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This incomplete understanding makes them accept even harsh criticism. They might challenge me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her work. ""There might be music I'm not fond of, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don't respond well to a certain composer's music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can't just choose a new piece. Ideally, I'd like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces, which would help lift the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I'm always working on big productions where the musical score is already set by the composer and can't be changed.""

Miranda doesn't like to attach herself to one institution. ""I think it's important to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that all the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to adapt my work each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.""

We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ""There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,"" says Miranda. ""This one really tries to show viewers what life is like inside a dance company. There was a scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I smiled in recognition. She knows she's not getting it right but can't make her body do what's needed. It's painful to watch but not staged for the cameras. The public underestimates the amount of work and dedication involved in ballet.""

I'm curious about what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ""It's when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together. Perfection might be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I've been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props is distracting. That's disappointing.""

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ""People want to label you, and I don't understand that. There's also a trend to develop expertise in a narrow area. I don't follow that, though I might one day be happy to be known for one thing. For now, I just want to broaden my horizons."""
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there's so much to experience outside? That conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of an old sofa, which became the main feature of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to secure myself. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even spending one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to continue. I've been on many walking trips recently, but this was completely different. It was the longest distance I've ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino, instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I often had to tell people, ""No, I'm not doing it for charity, and I'm not training for a marathon."" When someone at work asks about my weekend, I'd rather talk about dragging a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea. At the Greek port, the man seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although he still looked puzzled, he let me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group—not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was happy when I finally did it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and enjoyment. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant isn't easy, but it's a job I love. Since I started, I've traveled all over, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have lots of free time, and life is never dull. It's perfect for someone young like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, so I often flew alone. I felt lonely and would ask flight attendants if I could help serve meals, and some let me. This memory stayed with me when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new path. At the interview, there were many young people, and lots of them got accepted. They were often well-qualified and changing careers, just like me. I practiced what to say before the interview, focusing on my strengths and past work experience, not just my love for travel. This helped me get the job! I recommend this work to anyone because there are many benefits, though free flights aren't the main one. Airline staff work very hard, and there's a saying: ""no-one's finished till everyone’s finished."" It's like a big family. Even if we don't see each other often, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to think about work. And if I do encounter difficult passengers, which doesn't happen often, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won't see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love watching the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel very nervous, but with some encouragement, they agree to try, and eventually, they all reach the top. This achievement makes them feel really good. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home. Surprisingly, it's not the youngest ones who feel this way the most; it's usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's a bit late to call now and suggest they do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they thank us because they've had a great time.

It's not just the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call us a lot, asking how their child is doing, which isn't really necessary. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to ask the parents to call back later. We also often see a certain type of child who comes dressed in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it's necessary."
120,"""Rock the Planet"" is a musical show where the actors also need to be great musicians. It started in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won 'Best Musical' four times. Doing the show with only British actors was difficult because the UK has stricter rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first 'Best Musical' award. The London theatre is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night because everyone wants to hear the songs that were first popular in America.

I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ""It's amazing that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar."" He explained how busy the young actors are. ""We have regular school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends."" I asked what his friends think of the show. ""My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it's expensive for them,"" he said.

When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found an extra one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called ""Days,"" which I didn't know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie's talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show's director wasn't there to hear my mistakes!

The young actors were already musicians, and some could play several instruments, but none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it's definitely worth seeing."
