1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you're just telling people, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This made people more aware that sharing everything online might have negative sides. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering possibilities like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing confessions, personal photos, and stories. But soon, we realize the online world is crowded and risky, and we can get lost. This might sound depressing, but don't lose hope. There is a guide for this future, created by a group of early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the dangers of fame, all before social media existed. These early users, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few young people like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While his work was very open, it also had a certain beauty that some might call art. However, one day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called Dark Night. He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you more, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog's address to all the vice presidents at her company, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and started her blog again, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that while the internet lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.

At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film talked about how new discoveries show that the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing because it is simple and clear. However, scientists usually say, ""Give me a break."" They mean that while the idea is interesting, we need strong proof to believe it. Nice pictures of crystals are not enough.

The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force that is expanding the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. Scientists have discovered that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy.""

Apart from the film, other amazing discoveries are being made. Neuroscientists found that our conscious perception of events is about half a second behind reality, but our brains edit this delay out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans first lived and why they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's design.

Science is far from complete. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some of the world's top physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people think the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn golden. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. Writing these two types of stories might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but I found it memorable. It felt like my fictional world expanded, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revising can take a long time). It's not like the full commitment needed for the year or two it takes to write a novel. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That's it. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I'll make it through. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace for me. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small things – an idea, a word, an image, anything. It's often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don't have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn't work out, you just accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't make every short story a masterpiece. This is comforting to me. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like soft shadows I've left in the world, faint footprints I've made. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is clear to experts, but its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and its mistakes are either ignored or exaggerated. 

Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced by new ones, similar to how new music styles are first mocked but later accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. We will admire these ideas but also question them, recognizing both human creativity and limitations.

Science is always changing. Scientists often challenge each other's ideas. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Later, physics showed that our observations can affect the universe, and we don't fully understand basic concepts. Some people think this shows science can't explain everything, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing.

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, relativity, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Some people now think we are close to a complete theory of the universe. Maybe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the world their children will live in and even the children themselves. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future, and these decisions are important for budgets, health, and life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after years of growth, big publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped increasing or even went down. This raised new questions about the future of ebooks in the publishing world. One publishing executive, who didn't want to be named, said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed book. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace printed books. Whether people are predicting or dismissing this idea, the thought of books disappearing continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about new technology and change. 

In my research, I have talked about how the idea of one type of media replacing another often comes up when new technologies appear. Even before digital technology, people predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would die. But radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars or at work. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. As early as 1894, people thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some people thought the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others believed ebooks would bring great benefits. 

The idea of books disappearing often comes up during times of technological change. This story shows our hopes and fears about new technology. To understand why these feelings are common, we need to remember that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Many studies show that we develop close ties with things like books, TVs, and computers, sometimes even naming our cars or getting angry at our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers comes along, it doesn't just mean economic and social change. It also means we have to change our relationship with something that is part of our daily life. As technology advances, we often miss what we used to have. This is why industries grow around old products and technologies. 

For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. The change from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for silent films. The same happened with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have made people appreciate the physical quality of old books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should comfort those who worry about print books disappearing. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a popular story about the power of technology and our dislike of change. One way we try to understand change is by using familiar stories, like those of tragedy and endings. These stories are easy to remember and share, and the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our personal world – and, in the end, ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, almost every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I focused on how some of the greatest minds from the past 400 years managed their time to be creative and productive. By looking at the everyday details of their lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I wanted to show a different side of their personalities and careers. I aimed to create interesting portraits of these artists as people with habits, just like us. 

The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the conditions for creativity, not the final product. It’s about how things are made, not what they mean. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even writing a business letter reveals something about yourself. My book explores questions I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to focus entirely on a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is short, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time?

I don’t claim to answer these questions in the book—some might not have clear answers. But I’ve tried to show how different successful people have dealt with these challenges. I wanted to illustrate how big creative ideas are built from small daily actions and how work habits affect the work itself. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine might seem ordinary, but it can be a powerful tool for using limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can help focus your mental energy and keep you from being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that having good habits allows us to focus on more interesting things. Ironically, James himself often procrastinated and couldn’t stick to a schedule.

This book started from my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was alone at the architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a morning person, able to focus well in the early hours but not so much after lunch. To feel better about this, I searched online for other writers’ work schedules. I found them easily and thought someone should collect these stories. That’s how I started the Daily Routines blog and eventually this book. The blog was simple; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the variety of voices that made the blog popular. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t be possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From then on, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of university, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He wasn't interested in the popular areas like the Jurassic period or dinosaurs. He was more interested in the very beginnings of life, studying ancient creatures in grey rocks. 

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job, especially in the kind of place he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving something doesn't always mean you get it. The process of getting an academic job can be unfair. When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied, but he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had an argument with his wife, crashed his car, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and the professor who replaced him didn't like the candidate the first professor supported. This led to Howard getting the job. Howard was surprised and grateful, but later learned the real reason he got the job. He was a little disappointed but happy to have the job he wanted.

Howard often thought about how his professional life was organized and planned, unlike the chaos of personal life. He realized how strangers could change your life, like when his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he went back to the college, postponed his lecture, and reported the theft. Then he had coffee with a colleague and a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils there, which would be his biggest challenge and secure his career. If his briefcase hadn't been stolen, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding the money to visit the museum in Nairobi. 

*An ammonite is a type of fossil."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they look like maggots, they taste ""slightly nutty and floral."" Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Through his research on how our senses work together to create the perception of flavor, Spence is quietly influencing what we eat and drink. This includes working with big food companies and top restaurants. 

Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink, a field informally known as gastrophysics. They look at details like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates and cutlery, and background noise—all of which affect taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers many interesting insights. For example, the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their food the most. Also, we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others.

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and low-tech, with soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less serious in universities. However, now universities are encouraged to show that their work has an impact, making this research valuable. Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often secretly, so customers don't notice the change. Research shows that if people know about these changes, they focus on the taste and may not like it as much.

Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a major food producer. At the time, people thought science and food didn't mix, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal and Spence worked together on the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish at Blumenthal's restaurant. Interestingly, the Italian futurists, an early 20th-century art movement, tried similar ideas with food and sound, but it didn't become popular.

Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. For example, his research shows that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a brand released a smartphone app that played music while ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says happens often.

At home, Spence's dinner parties are unique. Once, they ate rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. They've also had parties with a tone generator, headphones, and different drinks to see if they have different pitches. For Spence, home, shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, fake facts, nonsense, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and TV shows. Smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried that something will go wrong. Even though we think we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can make our thinking unclear. Multitasking creates a craving for new things, rewarding the brain for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain, is easily distracted by new things. This is a problem because we need this part of the brain to stay focused. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former professor of psychology, calls it info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while an email is unread in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. Wilson showed that the mental losses from multitasking are worse than those from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, found that learning new information while multitasking sends the information to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts and ideas. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember. Multitasking also requires decision-making, like whether to answer a text message or not. Decision-making is hard on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can make bad decisions about important things. When talking about information overload, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not about email itself, but the huge amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other things done."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can't find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not considered important. Scientists focused on animal behaviors and their outcomes, not on whether animals have feelings or moral systems. But recently, this has started to change. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has led to popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a conscience, a sense of right and wrong? 

In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Those that opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure by jumping and kicking than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we produce and eat beef? The observations are clear, but their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the verge of a major ethical change, like the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, says we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler version of a ""theory of mind"" than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human-like qualities. The disagreement is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is difficult, can we ever know what it is like to be a bat?

Balcombe describes an experiment that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. One group lived in nice cages with lots of space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. Later, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that the birds in bad cages felt pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, ""We look back with horror at times of racism. One day, we will feel the same about how we treat animals. We can't support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger."" If Balcombe were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his views. Manning, who wrote a textbook on animal behavior, says, ""We are seeing a change. In the early 20th century, people thought animals thought like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are swinging back. But it is a controversial topic, and you want to avoid the noise of academics with personal opinions."""
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way to understand what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that people often think arguments help find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, it might also change how we solve complex problems, making it harder to think deeply. West points out that we are surrounded by a lot of poor but attractive ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Surprisingly, having more data doesn't always lead to better knowledge or decisions. 

The National Endowment for the Arts reports that reading literature has dropped by 10%, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media, like TV and video games, might reduce critical thinking. She says that less reading might be linked to this decline because people now focus more on real-time media and multitasking instead of concentrating on one thing. However, we still don't have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology has changed how we think, says Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology. She notes that reading helps develop imagination, reflection, and critical thinking, unlike visual media. But visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media don't allow time for reflection or analysis. As a result, many people, especially younger ones, might not reach their full potential.

How society views technology affects how it sees critical thinking. This is especially true with video games. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says that video games are not just entertainment; they can also be good learning tools. Research shows that games like Sim City and Civilization help develop decision-making and analytical skills. These games let players explore ideas and concepts in ways that might not be possible otherwise. In today's digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and motorcycle mechanic. He left his office job because he was unhappy with it. His first book talked about the benefits of manual work. His latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he noticed ads on a credit card machine while shopping. Crawford realized that these ads are hard to avoid and take our attention away from what we want to think about. This makes it difficult to remember conversations or think clearly. Because of constant interruptions, people avoid talking to strangers and close themselves off.

Crawford says we often see the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us. These things reflect our desires and can take over our lives. Many people are worried about this, like office workers who complain about emails but spend their free time on them. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing.

Crawford believes technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, it's hard to control ourselves, which affects society. We prefer texting to talking because it's easier. By only interacting with screens, we might lose important social skills. Crawford gives an example of his gym, where people used to share music. Now, everyone listens to their own music with earbuds, making the gym less social. He says real connections happen when people work through differences together.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public. More importantly, he thinks we should engage in skilled activities, like cooking or playing sports, to connect with the real world. These activities require good judgment and dealing with others. They show that real experiences are better than virtual ones. Crawford doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but that using your judgment is important. This helps you focus better and resist distractions."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question we ask each other. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, we answer this question in a few words. But when you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit tricky. Calling yourself a philosopher might sound a bit arrogant. Saying you study or teach philosophy is okay, but saying you are a philosopher might make people think you believe you have special knowledge or wisdom. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why do people think this way about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others' actions and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) said that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, was the best kind of life. Few modern philosophers would agree completely, but philosophy is still linked with deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just accepting what society says is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make our own choices. But living an examined life doesn’t mean you have to read a lot of philosophy books or spend all your time thinking. It means looking closely at your daily life to see if it deserves its importance. You don’t have to be a wise person living away from society to do this. In fact, to help guide people’s lives, the examined life should be practical and involve sharing knowledge, as it’s important for a good life. Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become more separate from everyday life, especially for people who haven’t studied it formally. This isn’t entirely philosophers' fault: universities focus on expensive and hard-to-access academic journals. So, philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. For most people, philosophy can seem far from reality. If philosophers used to challenge this idea, many don’t anymore. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy have become more focused on specific, technical debates, explaining them to other philosophers is hard enough, let alone to people who haven’t studied philosophy. In some cases, philosophy has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, a part of philosophy that looks at human actions. But recently, I feel this title doesn’t fully describe my work because ethics is often linked to rules, values, and laws. This is a new and not well-explored change in philosophy: ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at whether certain social practices are fair. The job of an ethicist today is to decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often think about them. But philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading films is wrong (it is) and then move to questions about responsibility, our views on art, and the impact of consumerism. In this way, philosophy can help people look more closely at the actions and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes this shows us something we already know; other times, we find out our beliefs are hard to defend. Either way, by examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and others who value food might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, philosophers have often used food to talk about other topics, like learning. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related ideas. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus talked about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is now often linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites, likely because businesses think it will help them sell more if people associate their products with famous philosophers.

Food is naturally social and cultural. It doesn't just appear; it comes from history and is shared with people in our communities. These communities give us people to eat with and the systems to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than any other product, making it an interesting topic for philosophy. Once food is made, critics start talking and writing about it. But why do they have such a special role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill; food critics are just better at describing tastes. Philosophically, the way we taste hasn't been studied much, as most research on perception focuses on sight, which should change.

Another part of food is its beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. But food is eaten and disappears, unlike art or music, which lasts over time. So, some think food can't be considered beautiful in the same way.

There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often show our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices, which is important for food discussions.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of personal relationships. At home, everyone shares food and friendship. Professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are only for qualified people, and their relationships are professional.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by enjoying food from other cultures and by eating together, which has a long history in international diplomacy. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore, so he thought about how they could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect the next one? He changed a classic game called Risk to make a new version: Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and long-term rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau was then asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very popular, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was the first game not based on an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players become sailors exploring a new world. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. To do this, they use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. ‘It takes a lot of time,’ he said. ‘Sometimes it starts great, but after a few games, it gets shaky, and by game six it’s broken. Then you have to fix everything.’

Legacy games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a small interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is really different and I think it’s pretty good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange, unexpected, and breaks many rules. I thought it would be popular with only a few people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this strange project.’ However, most players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He sees it as a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and you get that all the time with legacy games.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, liked the adventure of the game more than worrying about its lasting value. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and basically ruining your board as you played,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It’s like the story you get from video games.’ The legacy format is inspired by video games and the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV series. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a TV writer but moved to advertising and then game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start,’ he said. ‘But it’s not enough to just have a basic plan.’

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is interested in seeing how others use the idea. But he also thinks people might soon ask: ‘What’s next?’ Colby Dauch, studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is not so sure. For him, the legacy format has been a big discovery. ‘It’s the kind of idea that changes how you think about what a board game can be.’"
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children's movie, was shared widely online. Stories like this are fun because they make us think animals are like us. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very smart but look very different from humans. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

People often think that giving animals human traits is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes the opposite is true. He says that not recognizing human-like traits in animals, which he calls ""anthropodenial,"" is more common. By studying animal behavior, he shows that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.

In the past, people believed animals had complex minds. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said the difference between humans and higher animals is one of degree, not kind.

In the 20th century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines that responded to stimuli or as robots with instincts. People who thought animals had inner lives were considered unscientific. This view came at a time when humans were destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.

Dr. de Waal believes we are now starting to see animal intelligence as similar to human intelligence, though not the same. He notes that recent decades have brought a lot of new knowledge about animals, shared widely on the internet. The best tests of animal intelligence consider the specific traits and skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts. In her book, ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us on how many color patterns we can make on our skin. We would fail that test, and the octopus might think we are not very smart.

Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean. While octopuses have escaped before, it might be too hopeful to think Inky knew where he was going. However, he understands that viral stories can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers got upset because grapes are better. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a short video of the experiment convinced more people of the findings. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways."
17,"Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major change in technology, similar to the impact of industrialization. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for many years, but experts say that soon, robots will be used in many more areas, and many countries are not ready for this big change. Most people agree that robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, but they still believe their own jobs will remain the same. This is not true, as every industry will be affected by robots soon. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that would take two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a company called Simbe Robotics has made a robot named Tally that moves around supermarkets to check if products are stocked and priced correctly.

Supporters of robots say that robots cannot yet take care of or program themselves, which means new jobs will be created for skilled workers like technicians and programmers. However, critics warn that we should not ignore the importance of human interaction at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that in two years, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In three years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will have laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will rise by 60%, but many jobs will still be unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers.

Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be most affected by automation and robotics. He suggests that they should not rely on the government to protect their jobs but should instead look for ways to learn new skills. As technology advances, new types of robots will be created for consumers, such as robots that live with us at home and interact with us in new ways. This presents a great opportunity for companies but also requires new rules to protect our safety and privacy. With many jobs at risk, education is key to preparing for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it’s there."" The reporter's question reflects a common curiosity: why would anyone risk their life for something that seems pointless? Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams and face the unknown. It suggests that climbing might be about adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He described seven different types of climbing activities, or ‘games’, each with its own rules. He said that the style of climbing, like using more or less equipment, should match the rules of the game. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in Western climbing culture, influencing everything from magazines to discussions around campfires.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also be very limiting, like when climbers are stuck in a tent during a storm. This shows a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. But some argue that the simplicity of having limited choices is a form of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective in his essay. He suggests asking, ""Why do people climb?"" instead of ""Why climb?"" Fitschen believes climbing is in our genes; it's natural for humans to take on challenges and test limits, even if it's risky. So, the joy of climbing might be more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor adds another view. He thinks climbing helps develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these virtues, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing can help people develop traits that are useful in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who don't rely on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson argued that climbing achievements are more impressive when done independently, without help like bottled oxygen. This view caused some controversy, as it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Finally, climbing can be seen from a non-Western perspective. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone"" while climbing. The physical effort, the meditative focus, and intuitive problem-solving are key parts of climbing. Some say these aspects are similar to Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This offers another reason why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known as an intellectual and serious person who focused on European piano music. He wrote and performed a lot but rarely taught. People close to him saw a fun side, but he didn't show it much in his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel didn't take it seriously because he had taught very few students and didn't plan to start. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, ""You don't hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk."" But something about Kit, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played very well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital where he played beautifully. Brendel thought, ""I have to make time for him."" Kit's performance was rare because he played with a deep understanding and sensitivity.

As Brendel steps back from public life, Kit is starting to become known, but Brendel is careful to prevent him from burning out. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under his mother's watchful eye. He also composes music. Brendel says this is important because writing music helps you read it better. Kit has an amazing memory and can read music at first sight. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and understands Brendel's advice. When Brendel suggests something, Kit can apply it throughout the piece.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations. He doesn't like when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, as it can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit plays some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

Now at 80, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He says, ""When I was young, I didn't want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them, but there was still room for more, so I continued. Although I don't have the physical strength now, my mind is still active with music I never played. I don't perform anymore, but it's a nice new phase in my life."""
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden wasn’t in a dirty city. It was by a river and gently sloped down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places of peace and quiet. Grandad’s garden wasn’t special in terms of features. He didn’t have a greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass had broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He wasn’t without humor, though. He liked to say things like, ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ instead of just saying, ‘I don’t mind.’ He probably felt disappointed that he hadn’t achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which he didn’t love. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was very skilled at home repairs, like building bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother liked to change the furniture often. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I did like the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mother later why I didn’t get lessons, she said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

Given the choice of moors, woods, or river, I usually chose the river. I could escape into another world there. With a fishing net and old sandals, I’d find a spot by the river to take off my sandals and look for fish to catch. After trying to keep them alive at home, I’d release them back into the water.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it didn’t seem likely until my father told me about an apprentice gardener job in the Parks Department. He thought I might be interested. Although he might have preferred me to become a carpenter, I like to think he believed things might work out well if I pursued gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw my passion for it and hoped it would lead to something good."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and I do the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the steep cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and MacEwen gently pets him. Despite the wind, MacEwen feels completely at home on his island. He points out the nearby islands to me. He shouts over the wind, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds pouring rain on Rum’s mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep because rain is coming our way. As we walk down the slopes, he tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep interrupts our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to gather the sheep but isn’t doing well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen calls, meaning the dog should go to the right. But Tie goes straight into the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, sounding disappointed. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They go out and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by flashlight. I get used to it, along with having no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.’ So I do the same. Everything on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians, who get off with their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their feet to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay in a newspaper and bought it without seeing it. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know anything about farming? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it tastes amazing. Also amazing is my ferry ride the next morning to another island. In the past two months, many ferries were canceled because of rough seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, with or without a phone, is what I secretly hoped for."
22,"The game design industry used to be mainly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now it is taken seriously. Industry experts are not surprised by this change. Making video games, especially those based on movies, is not easy. It requires many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it is hard to enter, but it is growing.

Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is difficult to make progress in big companies or to influence major games. However, the industry needs more game designers, not just those who lead entire games, but also those who design specific parts. How can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, but Jim disagrees. He believes the only way is to make games. The tools are available, and you need to create something to get a job. Game design is more a lifestyle than just a job.

Another expert, John Field, agrees that making games is important but says it is more complicated. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense needed. Can you succeed on your own? John says it is difficult, but a good postgraduate course in games can help. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all types of entertainment and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but realized that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety in the field. Networking is also important to succeed in the industry.

The old stereotype of a teenage boy playing video games has changed. Now, games are seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. Games are popular with large audiences and are also a great way to learn. He sees many opportunities in this expanding field."
23,"Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me, but he didn't force me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It's only by practicing that you can score the spectacular goals that feel so exciting. The best players in the world have amazing talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes you see young players bumping into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I try to show them how to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that getting a good education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope that when he kicks them around, it doesn't mean he's like me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so younger players like me could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never told us, 'This is your big chance,' but we knew it was. Even though I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely a lot on close friends and family. Having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' Of course, I've helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and I think they would be upset if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I like using my money to make life easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I think I'll take a year off or maybe longer to do things I haven't been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father couldn't write anything sellable while we lived in Los Angeles, so Sam, worried about losing clients and money, offered to find us a cheap place to live. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn't popular with day-trippers. The road was not inviting, and the nearby resort, La Carmella, was more attractive for those with some money. Only people who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, the place filled with people. After months of being almost alone, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to write a script by a deadline and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty, for company. We didn't have a dog when we first moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him some water. My father half-heartedly threw a boot at him, but Rusty knew he wasn't serious and stayed closer. I asked my father, ""Who do you think he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us."" My father replied, ""You're wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes, he brought things he hadn't dug up, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved to swim and always came with me, even though I could swim faster and farther. He never got discouraged. That day, we had been swimming. My father, having finished his script, went to Los Angeles to deliver it, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in and out of the sea. As the sun set and it got cooler, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed tireless. They chose a wave, balanced perfectly, and rode it to the shore. One surfer stood out to me. She was much better than the others. She decided to finish for the day and rode in on a final wave. ""Hi,"" she said, ""why didn’t you join us?"" ""I haven’t got a surfboard."" ""You could get one."" ""No money."" ""You’re British, aren’t you? Are you visiting?"" ""No, I live here."" ""Is your father American?"" ""No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he wrote."" ""No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?"" ""Rufus Marsh."" ""You mean, Tall as the Morning?"" I nodded. ""I read that cover to cover."" She looked at me with new interest, and I realized this always happened. People were friendly but not really interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,"Violet Hetherington was asking herself, ""What have I done?"" as she stood in a long line at the dock in Southampton. The lines were spilling out of the building marked ""Departures"" as people waited to board the Queen Caroline ship. Her friend Annie, who was married to a diplomat and traveled a lot, had told her to arrive late to avoid waiting too long. But this advice was wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers said there was a ""breakdown in the computer system,"" which made the waiting passengers upset. Some tried to be patient or even cheerful, but most were unhappy. They had paid a lot for this trip, and the delay was not a good start. Violet wanted to leave, but when she looked for her phone in her bag, it was missing. This was more annoying than the long lines. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left it in the cab because all her contacts were in the phone. Her son Harry always warned her about this mistake. 

Behind her, a friendly-looking couple stood in line. Violet asked if she could borrow their phone to make a call. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at her flat. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn't tell Harry. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding because he shared her forgetfulness. Dan might even forget to pass the message to Kristina.

Finally, the lines started moving, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were fake walnut panels, lots of chandeliers, shiny brass, and carpets like those in airports. Violet followed signs to the elevators, which were full of tired passengers who didn't want to see their reflections in the mirrored walls. She was squashed in the elevator as it stopped at each floor, letting people out. At last, she reached the twelfth floor and stepped out. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had asked for. She had been worried about what to say if it didn't. Ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she had paid the highest price she could afford to make sure she had a view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he didn't know he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for pictures for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing interesting images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his home, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked at all of it and realized he had found something amazing by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They talked to families who hired her as a nanny and to employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be private and a bit unusual, always carrying a camera. She wore oversized coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘On her day off, she would leave with her camera in the morning and return late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Although she wasn’t very social, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed very dedicated to her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. ‘What is interesting about Vivian is that there are so many fascinating pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her style on her own. ‘Was Vivian very skilled and able to do this, or did she take ideas from others?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. The funny thing is he wasn’t really interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I realized the cityscapes weren’t what mattered to her. It was the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I had found something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But that's not true for Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she was calm even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who then asked, ""What's it about?"" This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are a series of crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found that the past gave her more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said, ""It's nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like they share in the success. There's a family feeling at home, and I got a lot of support from other people's grandmas."" She added, ""It's annoying when people think I'm not trying to do something philosophical in the book."" Catton wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. The book speeds up as it goes. I asked if it matters whether readers notice this. She said, ""I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn't matter, but if you cared, you could see them."" Despite its experimental structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she didn't plan the story in advance. ""I would write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be to get out of it."" She also wanted the book to be fun for readers. We talked about her love for TV drama series. The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she might be interested in screenwriting. ""That could be pretty cool,"" she said. Her conversation was full of enthusiasm, with a low, secretive laugh. She was excited when talking about her work and New Zealand. ""I notice when I come to Britain how my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to busy areas, to be around many people."" But for now, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I hope it gives her the inspiration for many more novels."
28,"When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he loved making things in his dad's garage and playing the guitar. These two hobbies became his job for the last 40 years: making steel-string acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny says, ""I'm still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? And using different types of wood changes the sound. It still amazes me.""

Jonny learned to play his brother's guitar at age eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ""Some people would get a job and save money to buy one,"" he says. ""But I thought if you wanted something, you should make it yourself. I studied guitars to see how different shapes and woods affected the sound and how to build them."" The bass was the first instrument Jonny made from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ""We drew and built model boats and airplanes, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use tools like saws and chisels. I also fixed and customized instruments for my friends.""

Jonny's bass guitar was good, but he didn't think about making guitars as a career yet. ""I was also interested in painting and sculpture,"" he says. After finishing school, he decided to study architecture at university. ""Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,"" he remembers. But halfway through the course, he left. ""I was too individualistic for it,"" he says. ""But I realized I wanted to build guitars. It's like sculpture because you shape sound. And it's more practical than pure art because people use guitars.""

Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a great guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ""still just getting by."" He can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to get noticed. He went to music festivals on weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his guitars because it didn't come naturally to him.

Jonny thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ""When I started, people thought the best acoustic guitars were made in the USA,"" he says. ""UK-made guitars weren't seen as good, even though we have always had good courses and skills here. But now, our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve."" Jonny says you can learn valuable techniques in classes, and new instrument-makers should take courses. However, he also believes there's no substitute for trial and error. ""Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn't, and try different things,"" Jonny says. ""If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won't sound good. If someone else teaches you, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything."""
29,"Any talk about English conversation usually starts with the weather. This is a tradition, and many writers mention the famous comment by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why English people are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They fail because they think that when English people talk about the weather, they are really interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not very exciting, so he finds the English interest in it hard to understand. He notes that England doesn't have extreme weather like tornadoes or monsoons. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you can never be sure what the weather will be like. 

My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the real point. English people don't talk about the weather because they care about it. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to start conversations and connect with each other. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not really about the weather. They are greetings or ways to start a conversation. This is similar to how monkeys and apes groom each other to bond socially. 

There are specific times when English people use weather-talk. Some writers say that English people talk about the weather all the time, but this is not true. There are three main situations for weather-talk: as a greeting, as a way to start a conversation, or as a topic when there is nothing else to say. This means there is a lot of weather-talk, so people from other countries might think English people are obsessed with the weather. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, use weather-talk to break the ice, and return to weather-talk if there is a pause in the conversation. This is why people think English people talk about the weather a lot."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were already interested because they chose this trip over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. When she couldn't find a historical novel to help explain life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. 

Alice found writing exciting but also a bit scary, though it was less tiring than teaching. Her former colleagues envied her because she still connected with children through her books. Alice's goal for her novels is to fill a gap in children's fiction. She believes many books for teenagers today focus on negative experiences or are complete fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are different. Alice always tried to teach English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel ""Tale of Troy,"" and she loves seeing children go from being bored to interested. She sees her writing as an extension of teaching.

Alice was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. She didn't want to spend her summer on a course she thought unnecessary. Before the course, she had to send her best piece of fiction, which she wrote quickly about a Roman couple and their baby. The course students liked her story and suggested she publish it. With only school report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, a critic and editor, helped her edit the novel. Alice says they complement each other; he helps improve her writing by suggesting changes, while she likes to add more scenes."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to compete in a special race. The race would be between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

Jonny was excited about the race as he stood at the start line. He said, ""I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold right now, so I’ll be warm in the car."" Alistair was also eager to start. Unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, Alistair was dressed in full winter cycling gear. He joked, ""I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he’ll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race began at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to end at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 meters up. This might not be a problem for the car, but Alistair had a tough start with a steep 25 percent incline. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair quickly rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss, while Jonny got into the car and started driving. They would only see each other again at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s confidence was quickly tested. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first problem: a giant tractor was blocking the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he joked to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!"" After a tense moment, Jonny got past the tractor and continued driving into the morning mist.

Meanwhile, Alistair was struggling with the steep hill. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched him as he kept a steady pace, carrying his bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side, the ground was open, and with the sun shining, he could show his skills. He put his head down, pedaled hard, and picked up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another local challenge. The roads in this part of Yorkshire are very old and not made for fast driving. Jonny had to carefully drive through narrow corners and a stream on the road. Once he was past the last village, he raced straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped towards Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. He pedaled hard and then braked as he reached the line. 

Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, ""Is he here?"" When they said no, he raised his arms in victory. Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. ""Well done,"" Jonny said, feeling disappointed. ""I’m gutted."""
32,"Playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a unique experience because of the silence. When you bounce the ball on the soft grass, you can hear the echo of your shots. The well-kept grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds make you feel separated from the outside world. This quiet helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try hard to concentrate only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, and people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused that I forget millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach all my life, taught me that this was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I would play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost twice, both times against Federer – in the final the year before and the year before that. Losing in 2006 wasn’t too hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at age twenty. Federer beat me easily because I didn’t believe in myself enough. But losing in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have done better, and it wasn’t my skills that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing is always painful, but it’s worse when you had a chance and lost it. Toni, who is a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me, even when I win. But seeing how upset I was, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might have been my last chance to win. I know a professional athlete’s career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment is important, but some are more important than others, and I missed a big one in 2007. Toni couldn’t make me feel better, but he was right in the end. I got another chance. In 2008, I was back in the final. I was confident I had learned from my defeat a year earlier, and this time my mindset would be strong. The best sign that I was ready was my belief that I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to, but they knew I was already thinking about the match in my mind. From then until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone."
33,"A young and idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in April 1957. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society helped make her famous by creating articles and TV documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes hides her real achievements. Many articles and books about her life focus on her as an adventurous girl, a privileged woman who dreamed of living with wild animals, or a determined feminist. These images can undervalue her true work. Based on how often her research is referenced by other scientists, the success of her students, and the data she collected over 40 years, Jane Goodall should be seen as a leading pioneer in her field and the world's top zoologist.

Her main achievement is simple: she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew they ate meat or used tools. We didn't realize they have emotions similar to humans or that their social systems are like ours. We also didn't know that chimpanzee communities have different cultural traditions. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is the most important work in this area and is like an encyclopedia for chimpanzee research. Her long-term study in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and, because chimpanzees are our closest relatives, she also changed how we think about ourselves.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of the person she would become. When she was five years old, in the autumn of 1939, she disappeared one day. The police and neighbors searched for her. As it got dark, she suddenly reappeared with straw in her hair and clothes. Her mother asked where she had been. Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours to watch. This curiosity can be seen as the start of her career as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using different voices. She sounds like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I just did a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to say many medical terms.’ Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors, even famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it. You have to make the script come alive for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get the parts because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.’

After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a normal acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV ads. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a major part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’

Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and many forms, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes everything from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and happy. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.’

The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that specialize in helping voiceover artists create them.’ She claims she got to where she is – near the top of her profession – through persistence as much as natural talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or simply practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is important, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more realistic jobs, like becoming a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems silly. But some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. 

For me, I had a typical cartoonist's childhood. I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and in a few months, I was making enough money to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are not high, but it's still a tough job. You shouldn't try to become a cartoonist unless you feel you can't do anything else. It's easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and leaves time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don't turn down any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don't really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about everything.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs at newspapers and magazines. But those days are almost over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create the work and sell it. The better you are at this, the more successful you'll be. I've seen cartoonists with average talent but great business skills do better than artistic geniuses who lack business sense.

It's surprising how many people are afraid someone will steal their ideas, even if they've never sold a cartoon. Some are so worried they won't let others see their work. To protect your work legally, just draw a small 'c' for 'copyright,' put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of those things was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to throw this away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it on a pile of trash when a young man came up to me, looking confused. He asked, ""You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?"" I said I was, but I already felt a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways. 

In the years that followed, I often felt sad about what I had done. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. The email was from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer and restorer named Keith Rushton. He told me, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back. He knew it was probably old, but he used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I almost cried. I would have paid anything, but his price was fair. I had forgotten my dad’s habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this strange story!

My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s when classical guitarists were popular. I loved its calming and gentle sound, which was nice for beginners. But I didn’t make much progress, so I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn’t need to play well to be a rock star. When I took my old guitar out of the box Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I stood up and put a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar is meant to be played standing. My fingers remembered where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands knew them. My fingertips felt the pain of pressing the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really for playing alone. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are others my age with a similar story. Maybe we could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was the only one talking about how dangerous not getting enough sleep can be. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them in these discussions. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, missing the last hour or two of sleep. This is usually the REM stage, or 'Rapid Eye Movement,' which is when we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years dreaming. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests that dreams are important. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who thought that understanding dreams was the best way to understand our minds. But it wasn't that simple. Later research on the brain didn't support this idea, and the study of dreams shifted to their physical origins. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He concluded that people who are interested in creativity use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Dreams, according to Stickgold, help us connect things in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new ideas. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create new combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ignore the obvious and connect things in unexpected ways. This is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come so quickly that I can barely type fast enough. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and we all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, which has a beautiful view of the sea, you can see empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading artist in the copyist art movement, meaning she can recreate famous paintings from the past, like those by Caravaggio or impressionist artists, with great skill. However, she doesn't keep any of her own work because they are sold as soon as she finishes them. 

Susie is very popular and has been a copyist artist for 30 years, painting works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so accurate that even art experts sometimes think they are the originals. While the original paintings are worth millions, Susie's reproductions sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. She has many clients, including galleries and private collectors, but she doesn't usually reveal their names. Some collectors buy her copies to show off, while others use them to save on insurance by keeping the original in a safe place.

Susie is honest about her work. She tries to make her reproductions look as real as possible and signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as an original is illegal, and although some people do it, Susie has never been tempted because it could cause problems. She isn't rich and has had tough times, but her situation is better now, and she doesn't want to risk her reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after finishing her art degree. She didn't earn much, but it taught her to be precise and gave her a love for plants. She has no regrets about that time, but she's happy to have found a more financially rewarding career. When young artists ask for advice, Susie tells them to learn to draw accurately and study hard. Her skills allow her to create anything from plant drawings to perfect copies of old masterpieces, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas.

Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie disagrees. She says impressionists painted quickly but were also very careful, which is hard to do well. Although Susie is very talented, she doesn't create her own original art. She has tried, like painting fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs. Susie is a perfectionist and is happy with her work as a copyist, which she has trained for many years to do well."
39,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything, except maybe being the fastest on it. She was obsessed with sailing since she was a child. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and people always wanted to know about the race. She quickly wanted to return to the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and workplace for 94 days. She explained how she planned everything carefully, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly showed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical items. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. She realized things she hadn't thought about before. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her think about how humans take what they want and move on. When I visited Ellen’s office, she had just finished a conference call. She explained why we need to act now to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways not to use them up,"" she said. At first, her message was to use less, but then she started focusing on re-using. She talked passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she said, ""but I love learning. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Sailing seemed selfish compared to this. This is about finding how my voice can help. It really matters.""

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to help young people think about and design a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she said. ""It’s what makes me who I am. You feel connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on the record, on practical things, on survival. My new message isn’t as simple as saying, 'I’m going to be the fastest person around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this is more important than anything I’ve ever done."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become a very famous teenager. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to encourage them to go outside and try new challenges. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

I talked to some experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agreed that a young climber might be physically strong enough, but they were not sure if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also doubted that a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that – we have a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow stronger gives me confidence. He is becoming mature.'

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father loves adventure too much? Paul says, 'This isn't about me trying to be famous through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, why not now? We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on reaching my goal.'

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a chance to set a record. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This gives Jordan a problem. People might say that focusing on records takes away the fun, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to share his story with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we'll stop this project and go to the gym.'"
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they aren't listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but even my classmates don't know much about classical music. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't own their music. The numbers are discouraging for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find that surprising. So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people often blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who love classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big classical music fan. I like many music styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk, play, and think fast. Experts say we can't focus for more than about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop songs also talk about things that interest teenagers more than long classical pieces without lyrics. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people are going to classical concerts now, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why people like classical concerts more as they get older, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might avoid it. Some people blame schools for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they play it, but it's not their first choice when they relax. For relaxing, it's always pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too, but she didn’t hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t mind if her mother heard because she already knew how Bonnie felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be kicked out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not start now?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. Bonnie always treated horses well. The horses were well cared for, she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony as she touched its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best one here!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They must be nearby."" The room with all the riding equipment was unlocked, which made Bonnie happy. She was so focused on putting a saddle on Maverick that she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I mean it because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The movement was exciting, and the breeze made her cheeks glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by how quietly confident he is. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia who has already released many successful songs. So how did a relaxed surfer end up performing on stage for thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" He remembers how it all started. ""But I was also swimming every day and surfing. Those were more important to me back then. I had my life planned out and was busy. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online."" These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos on their social media. So Cody, who had recorded more videos at home, was happy to share them. The responses were amazing. Cody was also a very talented swimmer. He trained hard with top coaches and focused on improving his sport. But then record labels contacted him, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine, at 12 or 13, trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked faces. ""I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody says it’s important to have a close group of great people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, we all have days of doubt. ""Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight years old, and he’s traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about how that affects him sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they’re here to support and encourage me in everything I do."" Success, in any career, comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to your big opportunity, even when it’s a bit scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be visiting countries I never thought I’d see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to stop the buildings from flooding when the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags. Last week, I worked with most of the town's adults for long hours to show I could do it. But my grandfather didn't seem to notice. With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of dark water created by the factory's release pipe in Milltown. There was thin ice on both sides, and the dark water was followed by solid ice downstream. As I took off my pajamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn't know him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It's better than having a famous grandfather because only he, my mom, and I know about it. Plus, I have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex,’ Mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ My wetsuit should have made that clear. He sees me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it's getting harder. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom gave me a sympathetic smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say he’s always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me photos of himself in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I hurried to the boathouse in the backyard."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa's, but it looked different from his other works and wasn't finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. It showed a river that took up most of the scene. It wasn't a river she knew and maybe not even a real one, just an imaginary river. The picture was strange and shapeless, but beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green, and the eye was drawn to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice—too casual, too detached—that showed her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others figure them out if they could. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it—for him to be so specific. Maybe he's going to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. I guess you can imagine his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone..."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""... every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted her, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually, he said the muse wasn't being kind to him today, or he had to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, having any influence over someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I will cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm unlucky that way.

What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute! It's small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet, so I was excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it has to stand in a corner.

I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But since Angela is only fifteen, I'll be in my small room for years. I don't mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only take a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it...

Then I had an idea. If I couldn't cut the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house. They secretly take things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' point of view, not the humans', which made filming more complicated. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' perspective. They wore out many pairs of jeans doing this! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I especially remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me was getting the costumes right, which other directors struggled with. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and had to be sewn into the dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t very accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren't there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, people pretending to be friends, and the ""can you get me free tickets to your dad's concerts?"" questions. ""Everything's going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. So while the rest of the band is staying here to record, we're staying for good. I chose this school because I want to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so cool. So normal. 

I walk into the school's main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I tell the school secretary. ""Name?"" She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. The secretary seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That's one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it's printing,"" the secretary says. She hands me the schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I'll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn't look lost. When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking attendance. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes look over my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! No one will suspect me now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn't have worn these. They give me away. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she actually gives us time to talk! All teachers should do this. ""So why'd you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many choices here. Do I say it's because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they choose South Beach Sounds, a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. ""He's an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I'm Becca, by the way."" And she doesn't seem to care. Excellent."
49,"The average American teenage girl today is expected to do many things. She should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and be average anymore. Being average is not enough, and not having big goals is seen as being lazy. 

Teenager Kristen Loose explains that people, especially adults, often forget how much pressure teenagers face today. They have lots of homework, tests, extra activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life. Even though these pressures are normal for teenagers now, negative stereotypes about them still exist. People in the media often describe teenagers as lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might fit these descriptions, it is not fair to say all teenagers are like this.

Kristen Loose says that many people think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She believes this is mostly wrong. She admits she keeps her phone close most of the day, but not just for fun. It is a tool that helps teenagers manage their lives better. Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and be reachable all the time, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their work anywhere. Instead of listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons. Schoolwork and activities now need attention all day, adding to the stress of busy teenagers.

Many teenagers start their day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep each night. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20% of teenagers get enough sleep. Also, 28% of teenagers said they fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are so tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week after all her activities. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen does not spend much of this time on social media or TV. Instead, she uses her energy to volunteer. She says that people think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests. But Olsen's favorite part of the week is volunteering. She enjoys helping others and wants to make a positive impact in her school and community.

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers might change, but they will still be proving it wrong and pushing the world forward. There will be a new generation of students making a big impact, even before they finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live near Bishop, a small town in the US surrounded by nature, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. In recent years, this group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project with a twist: it's part astronomy experiment, part outdoor adventure, which attracts teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to launch a high-altitude balloon to try to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside, there was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check temperature changes during the ascent. Two GPS trackers were placed outside the lunch box to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, was used to fill the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy had driven seven hours to get the gas tank. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For kids in this club, that's normal. Finally, it was time to launch. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they counted, and the balloon started to rise. Some of them ran and followed its path with strong flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was silence and a shared feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky, hard to believe it was just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor shot across the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure decreases, and the balloon expands until it's almost the size of a house. Then it bursts in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helps the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day, using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who noted they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to reach it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. Then they had to decide whether to drive or walk – it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or, even worse, up a very tall tree. ‘It's important to remember that these students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What may seem wild and dangerous to some is just a way of life to others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit disappointing, but it's also a chance to discuss the effects of atmospheric waves and how they might work above mountain ridges. And it's also another adventure story to share with anyone who asks."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she wasn't very interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. Her interest started by accident. Her younger brother was really into dinosaurs, a common interest for kids, but Chloe wasn't. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. It amazed her, and she realized she wanted to pursue it.

I asked Chloe about the support she received because Palaeontology wasn't a typical career choice for young people then. She remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. Chloe was nervous at first, worried he might find her annoying with her questions. But he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel more comfortable.

I mentioned how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe thinks films like Jurassic Park have increased interest in dinosaurs but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She feels movies often show palaeontologists as either eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks, which isn't accurate. Her job is varied; she digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs analyzing fossils, and writes for scientific publications. She also believes in explaining science to the public, especially young people, to clear up misunderstandings and get them interested in science.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs. She says the program makers knew what they were doing, and she was there to advise if needed. She mostly checked that the dinosaurs shown lived in the same time period. The program attracted audiences of all ages because it showed dinosaurs in a new, more realistic way compared to movies like Jurassic Park.

I asked Chloe why dinosaurs continue to fascinate us. She thinks they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. Even though our world feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us there's still more to discover. Palaeontology, she says, is like a form of time travel."
52,"I'm going to say this once: when you're traveling by car with your family, even if you're six years old, you probably know you're not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" And really, once you get there, it's not ""there"" anymore; it's ""here."" So if you think you might be ""there,"" you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" I'm sure no one wants to be ""there"" more than the parents who hear that question over and over during long car trips. Seriously, what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the scenery goes by outside the window. In the front seat, there's mom or dad, who gives out juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio station, and keeps everything running smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying—like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then he puts his other foot, then a hand, and soon he's in my space, and we're fighting. The driver and co-pilot separate us while the car swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a while. The beautiful scenery continues to pass by. Soon after, I'm trying to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. But the car isn't going fast, and the window isn't open. Where's it coming from? My brother is next to me, quietly blowing air on me. He's on his side, not touching me, so he's technically not doing anything wrong. Just breathing? What's the problem with that? I get angry. Tim gets yelled at, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again—for now. Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to deal with us in the back seat. For example, when we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he often says, ""Yes. We're here. Get out of the car."" ""But Dad, we're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour."" ""Oh, well, then maybe we're not there yet."" That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you're finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move far away from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is no. You're not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using technology. She says, ""Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together to communicate face-to-face.""

The games played in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, now known as Catan, created by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone involved until the end. This idea was improved in 'co-operative' games, where players work as a team to win or lose together, encouraging more social interaction. 

One popular co-operative Eurogame is Pandemic, created by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He remembers playing it with friends and feeling scared but excited, and everyone felt good whether they won or lost. This inspired him to create games that bring similar feelings.

Leacock loved board games since he was a child, even though he often felt disappointed by them. With help from his uncle, he started designing better games. Pandemic became very successful, and its sequel included more storytelling, similar to video games where characters develop and the world changes.

Interestingly, the growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games. Video games have made playing games more normal. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, says, ""Everyone with a smartphone has at least one game they like to play."" 

Video games used to offer social interaction in arcades or with friends at home. But as games moved online, players became more distant from each other. Some people who enjoyed video games started looking for ways to play games with others in person again.

John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, these games offer a way to connect with others in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many challenges. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she taught him to play the guitar. The only radio station he listened to at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced him as he grew up. He was 12 when he first heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. He says, ‘I was good at tennis, but I didn’t want to do it for the rest of my life. It was too much hard work.’ At 17, he left school to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to pursue music, saying he wrote lyrics during economics lessons and played the piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. Eventually, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he switched to another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune did not come. Jamie says, ‘In my artist career, I was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, I was in the right place at the right time.’ Writing for others is where he truly succeeded. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels send new artists to. This helps start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that writing with the charts in mind is okay. He asks, ‘Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?’ He believes they should write songs that are amazing and likely to sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone speak honestly about wanting to write number-one hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he just knows he wants to write hits and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goal. ‘When I go into the studio, we aim to write the best music of next year. It’s not just about being cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs,’ he says."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online but might be unknown to people who don't watch videos of bike stunts. He is a 'street trials cyclist,' which means he jumps from places like roofs or walls to other unusual spots. These stunts are filmed and shared online.

When I met him at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, many local boys and older people recognized him and called him a 'legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed. Even though I was doubtful at first, I was impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, he explained what he planned to do, and I often doubted he could do it. But he always succeeded. When I praised him, he seemed not very interested. Despite his online fame, Tony says he doesn't like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to interact with fans and prefers doing things rather than talking about them.

This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. He admits that this technology helps him make a living. However, he sometimes feels uncomfortable with everyone always using cameras and screens. Still, he is not complaining because he earns well from what used to be just a hobby.

From my experience interviewing top athletes, I know that two things are important to become a top competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent and help someone keep going despite failures. In risky sports, mental strength is crucial. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on easy obstacles but kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he takes unnecessary risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport and don't know he gets expert advice to reduce risks. He is careful about the risks he takes. He believes it's important to be aware of dangers. Some people never feel scared, but Tony feels fear and finds a way to overcome it. He is not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning. Sometimes he rides around to get in the right mindset before a new stunt. He knows he must stay calm before jumping. If he fully commits, he is fine."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. Her latest challenge was walking on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found high-wire walking very different. ""The training was a shock,"" said Helen. ""I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, then an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she said afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, using a kite, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally started his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got a serious fever and was stuck in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for hospital bills or to get back home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using an exciting tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night, because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope will give us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about how to protect their habitat based on what we find out. The work is very hard. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been difficult – some nights are mild, but more often it is wet. Also, it is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work so far because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we will look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is very important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from the company I work for. Every week, I get small samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, and spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make, and I keep my coworkers happy by giving them samples! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm at our food lab, and other times I'm traveling to buy raw materials. Since I have a young family, traveling can be hard. But I love the variety and lack of routine in this job, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. During the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how they are doing. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is planning for the future because you can only travel with the circus while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students start businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a job for making money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!”"
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you've probably heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the main singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers, but that's not true. They often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! 

""What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job!""

""Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There's often no written music to look at. I'll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always know which musical range is best for the female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it."""
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion. She created a successful company selling 'satchels,' which are traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These bags are now sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before choosing to make satchels, Julie considered different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She didn't just go with her first idea. When she decided on satchels, not everyone agreed with her choice. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She worked with her family from the beginning, especially her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels was inspired by children's storybooks. 

Even though Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they played a big role in her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To get more attention, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew. Her company now makes satchels faster than before. Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity is pictured with a satchel. Instead of spending money on online ads, she uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting.

There was a difficult time when another company copied Julie's satchel design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors to her office often comment on the positive atmosphere – people enjoy working there. There is now a new factory, and while the building is important, it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with her schoolwork. 

When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky thought it looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, at 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ""I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement stops, there's no point. Luckily, I found a new career.""

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ""We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,"" she says. ""The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a larger group.""

The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ""Some people aren't sure if having celebrities is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it to promote themselves, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should."""
64,"Ana Ronson, a singer-songwriter, grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher didn't listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her frustration. She posted it online, and it became very popular. People left comments saying they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn't know the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. But Joss convinced her this wouldn't happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was an amazing night. Ana says she prefers writing songs about difficult times because she has more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, which is about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes fans will like her songs, her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He also loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go too, and he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to visit. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about what needed to be done. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people lived along that coast. On the first morning, the only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far. So, I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop worrying about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it really felt like stress-free living!

When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss my family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many games would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. Because of my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. It took some time for me to agree, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. My mom and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it turned out fine in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy my first experience of living far from my parents. At home, I couldn’t spend much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part didn’t change much for me. I eventually got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I found out that to get a license, I needed to know a lot more than I had learned. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. 

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of everyone in the group. You also need other skills. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you need to handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive or if a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours because they might post a review online. Good reviews are important because they attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. I put a lot of enthusiasm and energy into my job, so my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. However, we didn't need to worry. 

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard, but seeing the elephants enjoy their food made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants! 

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we walked with the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. We chose this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn’t include meat, which we both prefer to avoid. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I definitely will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different customers, not just people buying them for friends or their homes. Hotels and offices often want flowers for their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep at that time, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often colder and darker than I would like, but that's normal for that time of the morning, so I don't mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I would probably only get pink flowers because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what other people want can be different. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can't find what customers want.

I don't really like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it's part of the job. Flowers aren't cheap, so I have to try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we make flower arrangements and calculate how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy figuring out how to create the best flower arrangements for the money someone wants to spend. That's what you have to do when you're selling things, and I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It's close to where I live. But a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to talk about a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we pick a different place in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the perfect atmosphere for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to just cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still always a lot to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say they had a great time, it’s wonderful. The website has been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve visited to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing is as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed."
71,"As a child, taking photographs was my favorite thing to do. When I was 15, I wanted to make my hobby more serious, so I decided to do something special. I started a personal project: to take one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to share my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was surprised to find that people liked how I saw and photographed things. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then someone suggested that my project would be better if all my photos had a common theme. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing, as they mostly took color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost quit several times. But in the end, I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good enough for me to work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I’ve never regretted my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and they are run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was quite shy then, and all the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a couple of weeks. I decided to take up the challenge, but only because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me continue volunteering at the club because I had made great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to going. 

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before starting at the club, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was so young that I hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly started to love the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored of snowboarding, but I love competing and winning, which makes me want to try harder. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn't sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That success made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying because there is no snow. I train every day, but it's nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. It's the best way to cope with not being able to do what I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I think it's important to have another option in case I don't succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I'm considering becoming a doctor if I can find time for college. I can't imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can't do it my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I'm grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I was surprised at how easy it was, even though it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewelry to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. I wanted to know if other people would like them too, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are always many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewelry to take home as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country were calling to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but it was just my mum and me at the market stall! That's when I realized it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I've made a lot of money through my business, mostly online, but we still have our market stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called ""Being Amelia,"" which became very popular. The book is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, ""Because of my dad’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I got good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, fits into a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination to write about that.""

Janine started writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers always encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. Because of this, when Janine finished ""Being Amelia"" and sent it to a publishing company, they were very interested in reading it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was being sold in bookshops.

One review of ""Being Amelia"" says that even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the characters in the story actually face some tough challenges, which makes them believable to readers. The reviewer says that even though Janine is still very young and ""Being Amelia"" isn’t a very long novel, she has shown that she is a better writer than some other bestselling authors.

Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. ""At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! It all began when my father was asked to be the castle's manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was happy because he thought he might not get such a great opportunity again, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very lively in summer because it attracts lots of visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island, which often involves a lot of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day back to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days when there are huge waves – but the ferries don't run then! And I've found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I'm always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, though, it's so foggy that you can't see anything, then within hours, it's bright sunshine again – it still seems incredible when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it's been here for centuries – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different bird species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after we returned home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m almost there. On family holidays abroad, I’ve had the chance to see birds from other countries, too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they’d really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a pretty good player. However, my family knew that I often got excited about new hobbies and then stopped them, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. In fact, I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. And the chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know that young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club when I was just 13 years old. After that, I got much better. Even so, people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach’s voice cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will let them see the professional environment and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team if they’re ready to work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"In recent years, both in the UK and around the world, there has been a trend in higher education to get new students involved in research early in their studies. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making big discoveries. Instead, research is a natural and important way to learn and develop skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your job because they help you think about the world and how you work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You don't just learn and repeat it; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? Why does it matter? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is the complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts, which leads to big changes and new knowledge. On the other end, research can be everyday inquiries with a strong design, careful work, and thoughtful questions about issues, practices, and events. Most students have been researchers in some way. You have done research for school projects and answered questions since your early days at school or work. You have asked questions that led to investigations and research since you first became interested in studying. You have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things at home, training a pet, choosing a music system, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, having a curious mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas, and creating your own responses and knowledge are expected learning activities. Some students might find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and authorities, and you might feel you need to be told what is important to learn. However, in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem daunting. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research of others is useful to students, academics, and in the workplace, but we need to do more than just repeat what we read. We need to engage with it, think about it, test it, and see if it is logical, reasoned, and supported by evidence. We should not blindly accept facts and information given to us by others."
80,"Cities have always been places where people share ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. We have known that city life is tiring, but new research shows it can also make us think less clearly. One reason is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for our brains. Studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees. Even a quick look at nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from city life.

This research is important because, for the first time, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. These unnatural surroundings affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy street, our brains have to keep track of many things: distracted people, traffic, and the confusing city layout. This constant attention is tiring because our brains have to decide what to focus on and what to ignore.

Natural settings, on the other hand, don't require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature helps restore our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York offer a break from urban life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people try many things to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or changing office layouts, simply walking in nature seems to be more effective.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain centers of intellectual life. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that tire our brains, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The many social interactions in cities drive creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a hub of new ideas, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of technology and creativity. Less crowded cities might produce less innovation over time.

The challenge is to reduce the mental stress of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people get tired of nature and want to return to the city."
81,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious to say that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain-scanning technology to show this. However, I believe that the study of the mind should not stop at the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as brain cells, are part of human thinking. Archaeology shows that things like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have played a role in human evolution and the development of the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might also be part of the mind.

It is easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually have around them. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limits of brain-scanning machines. But this often makes us forget that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I am not saying that the brain is not important for thinking, but that the mind is more than just the brain. It might be helpful to think that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world.

This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers and symbols out of clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how these ways have changed over time and what that means for how we think. This approach gives us new ideas about what minds are and what they are made of by changing what we know about how objects help the mind.

Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be continuous. It also shows how flexible the human mind is: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick plays an active role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. This reminds us that human intelligence can change a lot by using new technology.

I see the human mind as always evolving. It is important to remember that, throughout history, the 'stick' has been a way to explore the world, not a limit. Through the 'stick', humans feel, discover, and understand the environment, and also find new ways forward. This is different from a monkey using a stick to get food. For humans, 'sticks' are used to satisfy our curiosity. This unique human tendency to engage with objects explains why we make things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world.

I want to include material objects in our understanding of the mind. MET offers a new way to understand how different objects, from stone tools to smartphones, have helped define and change what we are and how we think. Mind-changing technology might sound futuristic, but humans have used it since they first evolved."
82,"Photography is one of the few inventions that has greatly changed how we see the world and our culture. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became a part of everyday life. It was used in many areas, such as science, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians say that photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. No other art form from the US has been as influential. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, it was a mechanical process, which matched the growing interest in technology in the US. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world feel smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes. Second, the camera was a tool that helped people show their identity. In the US, it was common to create and recreate personal and national identities. Third, the camera was important for creating family memories, even if they were idealized. Lastly, the realistic nature of photographs matched the US artists' focus on realism and everyday life.

A photograph draws attention to something the photographer wants us to see. It is a record of events, people, or things, showing what was in front of the camera. This gives photographs a sense of objectivity. However, since a person takes the photograph, it also has a personal point of view, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, but its meaning can be complex. No image is shown without some context, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery, which affects how we understand it.

To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and how it was first seen. The same photograph can be seen in different places and times, and its meaning can change. The camera's role in art was once a secret, but now it is widely used by contemporary artists. Since the time of US artist Andy Warhol, who used photographs in his art, artists have been incorporating photographs in various ways. In short, photography has become an important part of art, working alongside painting to shape our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea of what this means. However, understanding mental life can be tricky, even though it can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, as well as humans.

James was mainly interested in human psychology. He believed it included basic elements: thoughts and feelings, the physical world around us, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is personal and comes from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It might be influenced by scientific facts, but often we use our own experiences to make judgments about psychological issues. We act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex topics, like whether brainwashing works, or why people behave in certain ways, such as feeling insulted or unhappy.

Problems occur when people see things differently. Formal psychology tries to find methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in a situation. Psychologists help us tell the difference between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and scientific facts. Psychology, as James defined it, is about the mind or brain. Although psychologists study the brain, they don't fully understand how it affects our hopes, fears, and behaviors. It's hard to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by observing behavior and making guesses about what's happening inside us.

A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings aren't directly observable like an engine. We can only see them indirectly through behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, using clues from careful observation and analysis. These clues must be measured accurately and interpreted logically.

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control or change the processes it studies. Once these goals are met, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life. Psychological research has helped in areas like teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings better.

Psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, but scientific investigation began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or looking into one's own mind, to answer questions. They wanted to identify mental structures, but introspection has limits. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of brain activity. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows the other side of consumer capitalism, where not all products succeed. Here, you can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were taken off the market because almost no one wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story about the people who designed, marketed, and sold it. 

What is surprising about the museum is that it is a successful business. You might think that companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but they often don't. Many business executives visit the museum because they didn't keep samples of their own failed products. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, wanted to create a 'reference library' of consumer products, not just failures. Since the 1960s, he collected samples of every new product he could find. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection mostly consists of unsuccessful ones.

Today's culture of optimism might explain why these products ended up in the museum. Each product went through meetings where no one realized it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might have spent more money on a failing product to try to make some sales and save face. People involved often don't talk about what went wrong, focusing instead on being positive.

This focus on optimism is common in the growing 'self-help' industry. One popular method is 'positive visualization,' which suggests that imagining success makes it more likely to happen. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that people tend to believe things will go better than they actually might. Her research shows that well-balanced people are often overly optimistic about their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen studied whether 'positive fantasies about the future' are effective. Her research found that thinking too much about success can actually reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people who imagined having a very successful week at work often achieved less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck says our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a 'fixed theory' mindset think ability is natural and unchangeable, so they see failure as proof they aren't good enough. For example, a sports star who believes he is a 'natural' might not practice enough and fail to reach his potential. On the other hand, people with an 'incremental theory' mindset believe ability can grow with effort and challenges. They see failure as a sign they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger after being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset can lead to a happier life, whether or not it leads to success."
85,"Sports teams often have an advantage when they play at home, but why is that? Many people think they know the reason, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists are studying what helps players perform their best, and they have many theories about home advantage. On the other hand, people who invest money in sports wonder if home advantage should matter at all. If players are paid well, shouldn't they perform well anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach fans there? It would matter to British fans who believe their support is crucial for the team. Fans often think that their cheering leads to goals, but they forget the times when their support didn't result in a goal.

However, there is one thing that fans seem to get right. Home fans often try to influence the referee. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This suggests that referees try to avoid making decisions that would upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in English football won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar to each other. Despite these changes, home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because basketball relies more on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home.

Another reason for home advantage could be related to players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This might be a natural urge to defend their home ground. In recent rugby matches, underdog teams playing at home won against stronger opponents, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important to athletes and their coaches. The saying is interesting for two reasons. First, many people argue about who actually said it first. Second, its meaning is not clear. Player didn’t really mean 'lucky'; he was speaking ironically. What he meant was: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ But how much better can you get with practice? This question is part of the nature-nurture debate, which asks if talent is something you are born with or something you learn. However, calling it a debate is not quite right because it suggests both sides are equal. In reality, the idea that practice is more important than natural talent has been more popular. This idea comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson, who said that you can become an expert in anything with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory became popular through books like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers"" and others like ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" These books say that practice is the most important thing and that 10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert. But, as David Epstein argues in his book, this is not always true. He shows many examples to prove his point. Epstein starts by pointing out a problem with studies on what makes people excellent: they often only look at successful people. He asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have certain skills and others don’t. He explores how much of this is due to natural ability and how much is due to environment, support, and determination. Epstein travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and even looks at animals. In Alaska, he learns that the key to winning a tough sled dog race might be the dogs’ natural drive, suggesting a mix of genes and learned traits. This challenges the idea that commitment and determination are just choices. What if, like the huskies, a person’s drive is also partly genetic? These examples show how complex the topic is. Epstein talks about 'hardware' (nature) and 'software' (nurture) and says that for top athletes, you need both. He doesn’t ignore the importance of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest runner. But Epstein also looks at cases where natural ability is so important that you can’t ignore genes. He also discusses race and gender. He asks: ‘If only practice matters, why do we have separate competitions for men and women in sports?’ Sometimes the simplest questions are the most important."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers, and have lost touch with nature. She believes this is the main problem. This idea is similar to other discussions about childhood today. A follow-up study talked to children and found that many would be happier if they could play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, when they spent time exploring outside, swimming, or building forts. They think this was healthier than the way children live now. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have made life more protective for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book has strong arguments. She talks about how parents' fear of danger keeps kids indoors, which benefits the toy and gadget industry. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. It's unclear how common these rules are, but Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly. She also talks about childhood freedoms and rules, from fairy tales to school regulations. Her arguments are interesting, but sometimes she goes too far and ignores important counter-arguments. For example, she compares modern treatment of children to racism, which seems exaggerated.

Griffiths is very romantic about children. She mostly sees them in an idealized way, which might not match reality. She believes children should have freedom to explore and take risks. She argues that children need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children might want the adventurous life she describes. Some children are naturally shy or cautious. The real issue might be forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my schooling. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those with more to learn play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, and moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We no longer need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate problems, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam and thinking about the consequences. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on imposed questions with one right answer. More important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care about them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit if they want. This makes play democratic because players must keep others happy to continue the game. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and pressure for high grades has grown. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults present have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant over time. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, experts warning about dangers, less cohesive neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to follow their natural desire to play and explore, so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to directly contact potential employers, which used to be possible only by standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with this access, there is also a higher chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the jobseeker thought they could help him get a job. But the executive was upset by his request. She refused his contact request and sent a harsh rejection note, which became very popular online. People who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might now regret how she wrote it, even if she still agrees with the message. If this incident makes young people think more carefully about using social media professionally, it might actually help them. It shows that social media can be risky for job seekers who don’t know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes. 

There is an irony here because, in many countries, social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was like an online playground where we could impress others and try new things. It was mostly about fantasy. You could chat with someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. By choosing the right pictures or songs for your Facebook page, you could become a different and more interesting person overnight. And if you didn’t want to talk, you could just ""poke"" people on Facebook. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. For some young people, the difference is not clear. We first became popular online by being bold and confident, which might be why some of us still think this is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook doesn’t mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you’re worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn’t work anymore, and we must meet employers’ standards to succeed in the job market. 

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too familiar and seem arrogant. This makes older generations think of us as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, we are far from this; in many countries, we are very worried about finding jobs, which is why we turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt young people's chances of getting a job, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable workers. 

So, what is the right way to contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them – maybe you could do some research for them or help in another way. This approach gives you a better chance of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, mass emails, and keep your tone humble to avoid upsetting the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it needs careful handling if you don’t want to be rejected."
90,"Anyone who claims they can predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main news source for only 26% of people, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people predict that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist said books and theatre were outdated, but theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived alongside TV, and cinema has competed with videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008.

Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. It was also because people started to believe that everything is always changing and they needed regular updates, a concept that was strange in medieval times. Now, we expect change. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life was seen as cyclical, with important truths repeating.

Journalism as a full-time job only began in the 19th century. Even then, there was no clear reason why people needed news regularly. Regular newspaper publication can be limiting. Online news allows readers to check updates based on their interests. Search engines and algorithms help personalize news. Online news can provide minute-by-minute updates and correct errors quickly. There are no space limits, and full documents can be accessed. This is very different from traditional newspapers.

However, online news often focuses on being first and creating excitement, rather than spreading understanding. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we are returning to that. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction, or they might find a way to help us understand our complex world."
91,"If humans were comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy walking in the dark, just like many animals that are active at night. However, we are creatures that are active during the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a basic part of our nature, even if we don't often think about it. This is why we have changed the night by adding artificial light. We have filled the night with light, similar to how we control rivers with dams. This has benefits but also causes problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. 

Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design. This means artificial light shines into the sky instead of focusing downwards where it is needed. This extra light changes the natural darkness of night, affecting the light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. When artificial light enters the natural world, it can affect important activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding. 

In the past, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. For example, if you walked towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, you would not see much light from the city, even though it was the most populated city on Earth. People used candles, torches, and lanterns, and only a few houses had gas lights. There were no public gaslights in the streets until seven years later. 

We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but it is not. Many animals, especially mammals, are active at night. Light is a strong force in nature and attracts many species. For example, songbirds and seabirds can be drawn to bright lights on land or from oil platforms at sea, flying around them until they are exhausted. Birds migrating at night can crash into tall, brightly lit buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially at risk. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange times because of artificial light.

People used to think light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. While most of us don't need a perfect view of the night sky, we do need darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep and wake cycles can cause health problems. These cycles are a natural part of life on Earth, and disturbing them is like changing our balance. 

In the end, humans are affected by light pollution just like animals are. By creating so much artificial light, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural heritage, which includes the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, which we can best understand by looking at a dark night sky filled with stars."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his company will stop keeping track of how much paid holiday time employees take. This idea was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. The email seemed like it was written by someone from his media team. 

Ignoring the way the announcement was made, which seemed like an attempt to make the policy look friendly, we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn’t hurt the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other’s work better. 

The founder of the multinational company said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team are up to date and their absence won’t harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much you prepare before a holiday, there is always a lot of work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works; work piles up and you can’t control it. Someone following these rules might not take any leave or feel very guilty about it. This guilt can lead to stress, and if workers don’t take enough leave, productivity might decrease over time. 

There could also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is off and for how long. This pressure already affects decisions like when to start and end the workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotions. If the feeling of safety that comes with guaranteed leave is removed, people might feel they can’t take the leave they need because they don’t want to seem lazy. They wouldn’t have their legal right to leave to rely on. 

The policy might make workers feel stuck, unable to take their leave, or they might just stick to their legal rights, making the policy pointless. Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, anywhere, which has blurred the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company couldn’t track work hours accurately, why should it use an old standard for time off? 

However, if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being watched, making them monitor themselves, which could be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits like increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can happen without affecting worker well-being. I am doubtful that letting employees ""take as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts in a field review a scientific paper before it is published. This is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research, preventing flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often mention this process to assure the public and media about the reliability of research. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trust in published research? The answer is both yes and no. 

Examining these issues shows that scientific publishing is changing. While I still believe in some form of review before publication, I notice changes happening. One major change is the use of preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before peer review. They allow researchers to quickly share new results for others to read, critique, and build upon. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers, which affects both authors and reviewers. Scientists compete for spots in top journals, which can lead to cutting corners, like leaving out inconvenient data. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is suitable for a journal based on its newsworthiness, not just its scientific quality. These issues are known, but few are willing to change the current system.

Biologist Ron Vale suggests that preprints might help solve these problems because they don't require a big change from the norm. Although preprints have been around for twenty years, they are not widely used. This is partly because scientists are conservative and because many believe journals won't accept papers already posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review could lead to 'junk science,' but this hasn't happened yet. 

Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but authors know they will be critiqued by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper critiqued another paper, which is difficult in traditional journals. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and all comments were public, allowing readers to judge the arguments' quality. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments remain available, so the work isn't wasted.

Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing their effectiveness in spreading information. By using the internet's openness and the collaborative spirit in science, preprints can help focus on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" These answers usually don't satisfy me or them. So, one day, I asked a group to pick an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist would, and another paragraph from the object's point of view, calling it ""Poem."" One student wrote: 

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I'm a device that helps people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and even then, only for a short time. Most people will never need me. 

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to a good discussion. 

When I was in school, poetry was confusing to me. I thought every poem was a silly puzzle that blocked real understanding and feeling. After school, most people find poetry less interesting. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it's not like regular writing. It almost challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down because it's hard to understand or seems boring. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we want from poems? Aren't they supposed to be full of deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem to be yes. But if we want to cry, we watch movies; for information or strong opinions, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. 

However, one thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life is full of it, unlike reading sentence by sentence. But these ideas still don't explain what a poem really is. If you search online for ""poem,"" it takes you to ""poetry"": ""a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language."" This is academic talk, but it hides the word's roots. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poí?ma,"" meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things."" So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? 

Poets sometimes say poems are like wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or like machines – carefully made and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don't hold up when you look closely. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps the mind try new ways of thinking and see ordinary things differently. 

Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially if we think about how song lyrics can get stuck in our heads. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren't words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Think about a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, looking right at you: A poem can make a strong impact like nothing else, even though, as ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it never really becomes what they usually are – something made to be sold. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry books, but few expect a book to pay for its printing costs. A poem shows itself not as something for the market, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I've enjoyed finding every brooch and coin because it makes me feel connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, detailed loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring like the one I found.

I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. I called Marion and showed her. She stopped and asked, ""What is it?"" I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I was anxious. Later, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says you must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was confirmed as real and sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask me if I'll stop detecting now that I've found something so amazing. But those brooches and coins are still interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing. There's always the chance of catching a bigger fish tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their carefully planned trips, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian beds. Sleeping better is a nice benefit of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, in a new place with different smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and have vivid dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I think there's more to it than just relaxing. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, and smells. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. While sleeping, we process all these new experiences. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with different places. People often worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. In Trinidad, for example, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all felt sleepy and lay down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is also memorable. Being in a different place, away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said to her customer politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face like a bulldog. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said firmly, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change the woman's mind. Smiling, she agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, who they knew nothing about. Her husband Jeff had quickly pointed this out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff said when Mia told him, ""What kind of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" ""It sounds pretentious,"" Jeff retorted. He didn't like anything showy or fake. He also didn't believe in being too polite, which he called Mia's reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn't have hesitated to tell the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said a trash can lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and went into the back door of Medlar House. Her commute from work was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia had the idea to turn the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends that there was a demand for the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. From the start, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham. In a relaxed and welcoming environment, she let them try on as many hats as they needed to find the right one. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits so nothing was left to chance. She recently expanded her business to sell handbags and costume jewelry as well."
98,"It's a long journey from London to Atlanta, and Lawrence Okoye is thinking about his amazing sports career at his new home in America. He is confident, but even he is surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Lawrence has never played American football before, but he might be chosen for one of the top teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still learning about his new position in the sport. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be picked for a big American sports team is surprising. But Lawrence is used to proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on discus instead, after playing rugby. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training to prepare for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in a big NFL contract, Lawrence says, ""American football was in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then."" Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ""Pretty much,"" he says. ""I went online and applied."" Was he nervous about competing with experienced American football players? ""No,"" he says. ""I don't get nervous about many things."" Lawrence is not very talkative, but he believes in his abilities. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ""I was very pleased to hear that,"" he says, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is also cautious. Lawrence has no experience in American football. How can he make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have all the qualities needed. It's just about how hard I work,"" he replies. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? ""I am. There's no pressure on me. Many people say I'll be selected, but I'm not too worried."" This calm attitude might come from his disappointing Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved on from that experience and is happy he made it to the final with an impressive last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he says. ""The final didn't go as I wanted, but that's part of sport. I can always go back to it."" After his Olympic disappointment, some thought the event had affected him. Lawrence doesn't comment on this. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his great physical abilities, wouldn't it be better to focus on one sport? ""I understand why someone would say that,"" he responds. ""I'm trying to achieve something I've dreamed about since I was a schoolkid. If it doesn't work out, I can return to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I've made has been thought through."""
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, it hadn't started snowing in Siberia yet. I couldn't see any signs of human life. The view was a mix of mountains, streams, and forests stretching to an endless horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to a remote area to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it these days. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and said one word, ""Holodna"" (cold), pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman's over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. Ever since that first ride we took together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was his greatest so far. At times, he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could handle each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the people who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons, which are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to be part of this race. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form confirmed I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned I needed to stay oriented. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" they told me, and the pilot would explain where to look. I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. 

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. They told me not to touch anything. As we moved down the runway, my legs were up, trying not to touch the important steering pedals, and my hands were away from the switches. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight, despite the instructions. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense up and relax at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea. This was not comforting as we started accelerating. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned sharply left and dived, leaving my stomach high up and my lungs feeling squeezed. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for a small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even done any acrobatics yet. 

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too because it was very responsive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, while flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience during a race. To show this, Dario got out some sandwiches and started eating happily as soon as we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed of doing loops over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you've ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. He says his perfect temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned how to survive in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. 'I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.' He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. 'I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had people who specialized in coral, elephants, chimpanzees. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.' The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. 'It is certainly easier to film today. If you filmed something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can film a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You filmed less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.' 'My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.' Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very difficult. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. 'We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim in very cold water and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even bigger expedition. Explorers are confident and determined people, and they need to be. This time, there is more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole. They will take detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tough by sending him out into the Scottish mountains during blizzards with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in cold places, and Pen showed he had great physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he is at home because he is often thinking about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horses compete against runners. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he says. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in how I said goodbye. I told my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He took it very seriously, but it was too much pressure for him. It was well-meaning but unfair.’ Because of this, Pen plans to have little contact with his family while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending his last days before leaving getting his equipment ready. ‘On the ice, you can’t fix things easily,’ he says. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer, will join him. They will have a team of six flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for Pen, and he is also worried about his age. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I haven’t trained as much as I’d like.’ Why? ‘Organizing things always seems more urgent. So I’m almost afraid of what I’m going to ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge, like in the past. ‘Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,’ he admits, ‘and not very useful to others. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re trying to involve as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which seemed strange and not useful before, are now very important. Suddenly, we’re useful to society again.’"
103,"I took a year off and wondered what to do next. Being an Olympian is amazing, and I had opportunities to write, work on TV, and speak at schools and businesses. These activities were great, but I missed having a competitive goal. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to try for the Olympics again, so I started running marathons and doing triathlons. Even with these activities, I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed the feeling of the boat moving through the water, but I wasn't ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked my rowing friends if they were interested in the race, but no one was excited. I knew if I joined the race, I would want to win. I wondered if rowing with Ben would give me the best chance to win. Probably not, but being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was already planning to do the race and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment alone would cost £70,000, which is a lot. We thought we had a good chance, but it would still be hard work to make it happen. Besides the race costs, I also had to consider losing income from being away. As a retired athlete, speaking at business events is a good way to earn money. It's nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I could talk about something current, like rowing across the Atlantic. Planning this adventure taught me to appreciate the easier life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but looking back, it was straightforward. I trained almost every day, but I had a set program and support from doctors and dieticians. I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I was concerned it might seem like I just wanted to be on TV, instead of choosing a better partner to win. But during our preparations, my worries faded. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about mental strength than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. However, he couldn't row well. I was surprised by his lack of skill, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have known his skill level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty spaces, maybe because of the noise and crowded life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm', which they said was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away.

November 6, London On my flight, I look at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies. I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out of the window instead. People say that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of flowers and leaves opening. But I think I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus going north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests with thin conifers covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely inside when I’m given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the sound of barking, which becomes very loud by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, pulling out huskies and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost crazy with excitement, pulling hard on the ropes because they want to go. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much anyway. I stand on the side and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a discouraging questioning about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m unsure. I don’t know. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in freezing conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around by overexcited huskies. But I feel triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used called emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she never really understood how big her achievement was at the time. She felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits.

During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep up her fast pace, fearing she might have to stop. Hartmann was upset by this, but he understood why someone who didn't know her fitness level might think it was risky to start so fast.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had already run 41 kilometers very fast but still managed to sprint the last distance in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run quicker than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would beat that time soon, but Radcliffe thought she could do it again next year. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

After the race, people wondered how Radcliffe, with her awkward running style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her for weeks, helping her recover from running 250-300 kilometers each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle pain like her. She would push me to work so hard on her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward.""

Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no time for a friendly chat; she was ready for a two-hour session. Radcliffe pushed him to give his best, which made her so good. During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became jealous.

Can Radcliffe explain why no one has beaten her record? ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves."" What does she mean? ""I never relaxed, even when I was winning. I always pushed myself as hard as I could.""

Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She never ran as fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" was released, I didn't know how people would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our show added something new to this movement, but I was still worried. Would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques, but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was successful and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether it's exploring the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often very physical, involving travel with passports and suitcases. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest in the series. In it, you travel around the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best-tasting golden pasta. These people have spent years trying to achieve their own idea of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was left out. I imagined people asking, ""Where's steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?"" But after long discussions, the TV team and I created a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on emotions, memories, and surroundings. Even though the book is called ""Perfection,"" I knew I wasn't claiming the recipes were the best. But I thought that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food experts, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying ideas and changing them until you have something unique. The TV series allowed me to explore new foods, people, and places I hadn't seen before, and I was excited about that. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. Some of my adventures included visiting a canning factory that processed the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm with low standards where we couldn't film. To perfect each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanner, and almost burning my house down trying to make a Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and suddenly went off the road into a field, stopping completely. John got out and opened the hood to look at the engine. He stood there for a long time, looking like he knew what he was doing. Finally, he admitted, ""Actually, I have no idea what I'm doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried and said, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was huge, with just grass and lots of flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was usually best to be on her side. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass and asked me to tell a story. Bea lay next to her and said, ""Go on, tell us a story."" So, I told them about how I heard two birds talking the day before we left London. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and a fight over a worm. Bea said, ""That's silly, no one understands bird language."" My eyes hurt, and I said, ""I do,"" but I didn't sound sure. ""Liar,"" Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ""Mum...?"" But she was asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped push the van to a hotel. Bea didn't want to get out, but the boys didn't mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back door windows. We followed John into a café near the road where our van was parked. ""It's a hotel,"" John whispered. ""It might be expensive."" ""We'll just have some tea,"" Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot and said, ""It's like syrup in there."" We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the engine. ""It's a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum made a bed for us outside in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn't moving. ""I'll have to get us towed into Marrakech,"" John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John driving it. At first, Bea didn't want to move, so John carried her into the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home since our van needed to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city. Lucy didn't catch her name because of the noise, but it was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing, their recent travels, and their future plans. 

Lucy mentioned, ""I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer."" It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She didn't want to do many of the things that filled her time, like concerts and competitions. These events took her around the world and made her miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. There was a party to celebrate. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant, and her little brother Gus imagined himself at the same festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. 

Lucy hadn't applied to the festival herself. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. Her mom said, ""I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in."" Lucy thought it was more like her mom didn't want to give her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy thought that causing trouble was the worst thing she could do, so she didn't even think about trying to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward, surprised. ""Tanglewood?"" he asked. ""Yeah,"" Lucy replied. ""How old are you?"" he asked. ""Fifteen,"" she said. He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't mean to show off. It was hard to know when she was just sharing information or bragging. ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're going to try..."" she explained. 

Liesel/Louisa excused herself, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed and asked, ""Have you ever been to Japan?"" He had long, shaggy hair, like many musicians, to show they were cool music nerds. ""Once. When I was, like, eight,"" Lucy replied. He started to say something when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,"" he said, taking her arm and pulling her away. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition."" ""They're not the competition,"" Lucy said. ""Everyone is the competition,"" her grandfather replied. He took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, only hearing about half of what was said.

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ""You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" Lucy liked that part. Being somebody. Even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special to the kids she used to go to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro perfectly. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Dad said, ""Spending too much time online isn't good for you. You need to experience the real world."" It's hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about this topic, and it's quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of who they are, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a key part of growing up today. Teenagers don't just use media for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do; they live in it. It's not about whether it's good or bad, but how you use it.

Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, compares social networking to how today's parents used to hang out at youth clubs. It's like a virtual youth club where teenagers can develop their identity away from their parents and learn to handle teenage issues with their friends. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that during adolescence, you ask yourself, ""Who am I?"" Social networking can help you find your identity by letting you share your favorite music or sports and see different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are less self-centered than those who don't use social media. He also says that social media can be helpful if you're shy because communicating online can be easier than face-to-face, allowing you to practice social skills in a less intimidating way.

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with specific interests connect with others who share those interests. For example, if only a few people at your school like a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group with similar interests, you can feel popular in a different way.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people, and create their own content are using social networks to their full potential. She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force, with teenagers making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity by allowing photographers to connect, learn, and share images. This can improve employability and be beneficial in the workplace. Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness, so understanding how it works is important. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on social networks, they could be potential customers. Linking these networks can build your customer base.

Matthews agrees that teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they start working. Many sites offer opportunities to collaborate and share content, which is a valuable skill in the 21st century and important for being employable in a digital age."
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they probably don't imagine a long trip across nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents had a different idea for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan what many teenagers would consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. Before the trip, my parents kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There's probably a good reason why!""

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. I had some ideas on how to cope. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home for smaller places to stay over the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into.

We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest, star-filled skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way!

The next day, we got up at dawn and started driving again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. As we climbed to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. We laughed as we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument.

We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common, and park volunteers managed them. Our own close encounter with a bear on the road, and an anxious park ranger, gave us unforgettable memories.

As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its problems, couldn't ruin our excitement. It was a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service, but it offered the most amazing views I've ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic foreign place to find something amazing. It was both happy and sad to be home again, but at least I hadn't fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our crazy journey to look through and remember. For me, the best memories were the unplanned and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, was going with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay because it was her final year, and she was happy to have the best room at the college, with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still be watching over Amy, even if she didn't like it.

Rose was moving to her grandmother's house. She only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose's parents were not very excited, but Daisy insisted it was no problem and wanted to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn't fully understand why her parents didn't get along with her grandmother, but there had been a disagreement in the past, so they spent holidays elsewhere. Rose was ten years old the last time she saw her grandmother, but her memories were happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting because Daisy was very social and liked to bring people together. Rose expected to get dinner invitations, coffee morning requests, and shopping trips soon. This made Rose smile because her grandmother was not a typical old lady and seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But Rose wanted her independence. She wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, or go out without asking for permission every time. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and she didn't want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood this. Rose's mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only. Rose was very happy. They all agreed it would be about trust. Her grandmother would trust her to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them went too far, they would talk about it again.

Rose was never a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and basically start her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced at it now. At least she knew this was the last time because she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed difficult, and she didn't know what other teenagers were doing, like participating in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. Charlotte recently told her former teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised. The teacher had thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte never considered waiting that long because she wanted to try something she might be good at.

On a winter afternoon, in the offices of Charlotte's publishers, I was surprised to see a teenager there, even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old about her book. The book is a big success: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of its main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn't need any support. She is confident, intelligent, and steady, which keeps her from being overconfident.

Charlotte admits that she is young and doesn't have all the answers. When I ask her about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don't have many life lessons to share with my readers,"" she laughs. ""I don't think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I also don't think I'm very wise. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.""

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in books. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who lacks social skills. Reading about these types annoyed her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who aren't flawed in some way. Some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers can't know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.""

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep psychological and life issues. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I was capable of it."" However, she praises a book called ""How Not to Write a Novel"" for teaching her that if readers can guess what will happen, the suspense is lost.

Some might think that Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father's connection in publishing did help get her book read initially. She admits she was lucky because getting a first novel read is difficult, no matter the author's age. ""Every aspiring writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show he knew what he was doing, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump. He went up the ramp quickly and flew into the air, waving his arms. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I liked practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it, and I was afraid of being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students jumped and tried new tricks, landing in foam pits – not a real introduction to what we’d face on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down again. Land in the right zone and you keep moving forward, reducing impact. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body ignore my brain and go fast towards the jump. My legs would almost go backward as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body is doing in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a few moments, I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I didn’t slow down as I approached the jump, went airborne, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold tightly onto the safety harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs up. There's a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park.

It's interesting that amusement parks, with their exciting rides, are a big business. To create the thrills and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's actually very challenging. Designers must create the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe. They also need to add new features to keep visitors coming back.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most of the techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the tracks made by specialist manufacturers.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it's about quickly changing between different forces so people feel excited but safe. It's a fine line between thrilling and uncomfortable.

To create an amazing ride, teams must build a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or the steepest drops. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that designers need to love thrills to understand what passengers want and to test rides before they open to the public.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add something extra, like painting an old rollercoaster, but the physical ride experience will still be the most important for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both activities with her busy schedule. She says, ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day.’ As a choreographer, she teaches and enjoys working with young students. ‘A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re willing to take risks. They want success but don’t fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This means they accept even harsh criticism. They might still question me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There might be music I don’t like, but I still try to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece. I’d like to be more experimental and switch to different music – it would help when rehearsals get tough. But now I’m always working on big productions where the music is already decided by the composer and can’t be changed.’

Miranda doesn’t want to stay with one institution. ‘I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to adapt each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’

We talk about a recent documentary on ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one tries to show what life is really like in a dance company. There was a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I recognized that. She knows she’s not doing it right but can’t make her body do it. It’s hard to watch but not fake. The public doesn’t realize how much work and dedication ballet requires.’

I ask what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. That’s disappointing.’

Miranda has done many different things, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to focus on one area, but I don’t follow that. Maybe one day I’ll be known for one thing, but for now, I want to explore different things.’"
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience outside? That conversation gave me the idea for my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend of mine was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main part of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to secure myself. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to continue. I’ve been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. It was not only the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. At the Greek port, the man seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the small islands. Although he still looked puzzled, he let me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first real 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was happy when I finally did it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, my speed and enjoyment also increased. We hardly needed the support boat. I can’t wait to come again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant isn't easy, but it's a great job for someone young like me. Since I started, I've traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with amazing people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. 

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, so I often flew alone. I felt lonely and would ask the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers, and some let me. This experience stayed with me when I wanted to leave my banking job and try something new.

At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people, and many were accepted. They were often well-qualified and changing careers, like me. I practiced what to say before the interview. Instead of just saying I loved to travel, I talked about my strengths and past work experience, and I got the job!

I recommend this job to anyone because there are many good things about it. The free flights are nice, but they aren't the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there's a saying: ""no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished."" It's like a big family. Even though we don't see each other all the time, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to take work home. If I do have difficult passengers, which doesn't happen often, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won't see them again."
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Almost all the children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel really good. Some children miss home at the start of the week. Surprisingly, it's not the very young ones who feel this way the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to call now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine after a couple of days, and at the end of their week, they all thank us because they had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call a lot, asking how their child is doing, which is not really necessary. Often, their son or daughter is busy playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back later. We often get a certain type of child coming, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."
120,"'Rock the Planet' is a musical show where the actors also need to be great musicians. It started in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won 'Best Musical' four times! Doing the show with only British actors was difficult. In the UK, young actors can do fewer shows each week compared to the USA, so they needed twice as many actors in London. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first 'Best Musical' award. The London theatre is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night because everyone wants to hear the songs that were first popular in America.

I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, 'It's amazing that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.' He explained how busy the young actors are. 'We have regular school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.' I asked what his friends think of the show. 'My whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it's expensive for them,' he said.

When I told Jamie I also play guitar, he found an extra one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called 'Days,' which I didn't know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie's talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show's director wasn't there to hear my mistakes!

The young actors were already musicians, and some played several instruments, but none had played in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it's definitely worth seeing."
