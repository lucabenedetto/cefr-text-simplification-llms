1,C2,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: when you tell everyone, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also letting all kinds of people know where you are, and not all of them are people you want to meet. This made people realize that sharing everything online might not always be good. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering exciting possibilities like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we find out that the internet can be dangerous and confusing.
However, there is hope. Years ago, a group of online pioneers showed us the way. In the early days of the internet, they explored these dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the challenges of being famous, all before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. We should learn from their stories. If we don't learn from history, we might repeat the same mistakes.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at Cern, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall shared everything, and nothing was off-limits. His work was very open, but it was also artistic.
One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called Dark Night. He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem of sharing too much online continues. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you more, you might be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, and she lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a place where we can say anything without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and pretending otherwise can lead to big mistakes.
Armstrong's story ended well. She was upset and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that while the internet lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.
At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film talked about how new discoveries show that the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be changed by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing because it is simple and clear. However, many scientists say, ""Give me a break."" They mean that we need better proof to believe such claims. Nice pictures of crystals are not enough.
The real problem is that the film's claims were not strange enough. For example, some scientists say that water molecules have properties because of a type of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force that is making the universe expand. This evidence comes from many years of research in labs and observatories around the world. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is being pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy.""
Besides the film, other amazing discoveries are being made. Neuroscientists found that our brain's perception of events is about half a second behind reality, but we don't notice because our brain edits it out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans first lived and why they left to explore the world. Some theorists even say there are links between life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Science is not finished. In fact, we are further from knowing everything than ever before. Many natural phenomena cannot be understood as well as we once thought. The ideas of chaos and quantum uncertainty show limits to what we can know. Some of the world's top physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite all these theories, many people think the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both are important and make a complete picture that I love. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colors attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons.
Since I started writing, I have switched between writing novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories. When I finish a group of short stories, I feel like writing a novel. I never write both at the same time because they use different parts of my brain, and I need time to switch from one to the other.
I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but I found it memorable. Writing short stories helped me expand my fictional world, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.
One great thing about short stories is that they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to make a short story decent, though I might revise it many times. Writing a novel takes a year or two and needs a lot of physical and mental effort. Short stories are a nice change of pace for me. 
Another good thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It's like jazz improvisation, where the story leads me. If a story doesn't work out, it's okay. Not every story can be a masterpiece, even for great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. This is comforting because I can learn from my mistakes and use that in my next story.
When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories' successes and failures. Short stories are like a testing ground for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so short stories make writing novels easier for me. My short stories are like soft shadows or faint footprints I leave behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like guideposts to my heart, and I am happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,C2,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also brought dangers. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it doesn't always succeed. It influences poets, politicians, and thinkers. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, and its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes think science is more or less important than it really is, and they often ignore its mistakes or exaggerate them. 
Science is full of conflicts. Old ideas are often changed or replaced by new ones, just like in music. New ideas are sometimes laughed at but can become the new standard. Scientists often disagree, and their emotions can run high. This book will talk about how science has changed not just itself but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical things like non-stick frying pans. We will admire these ideas but also question them, knowing that human minds have limits.
Science is always changing. Scientists often prove each other wrong. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Later, physics showed that our observations can change the universe, and we don't fully understand our basic concepts. Some people think this shows science can't explain everything, but usually, scientific changes help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps moving forward.
At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Some people now say we are close to a complete theory of everything. Maybe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance without understanding the consequences. We need to watch science carefully. Everyone should understand scientific advances because they affect our world and future generations. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future, and these decisions are important for everyone, not just philosophers. They can affect national budgets, the health of future children, and even life on Earth."
5,C2,"From around 2015, after years of growth, big publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped growing or even went down. This made people question if ebooks would be successful in the long run. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, as his company lost faith in the power of printed books. Even though digital and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea keeps our imagination active and causes debates. Why do we think of ebooks and print books as being in a fight, even when evidence shows they can coexist? The answers tell us about our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about new things and changes.
In my research, I found that people often think new technology will replace old ones. Before digital technology, people thought TV would end radio, but radio survived by finding new uses, like in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. In 1894, people thought phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This has happened many times with movies, radio, TV, and smartphones, all thought to end print books. Some feared this would harm culture, while others thought ebooks would bring great benefits. The idea of books disappearing often comes up during technological changes because it shows our hopes and fears about new technology.
We form emotional connections with media like books, TVs, and computers. Studies show we even name our cars or get mad at our laptops. When new technology like e-readers comes, it changes our relationship with things we are used to. This makes us miss what we had before, which is why industries for old products and technologies exist. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. When movies got sound in the 1920s, people missed silent films. The same happened with photography and music records. E-readers made people appreciate the feel and smell of old books again.
This should comfort those worried about print books disappearing. But the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a popular story about technology's power and our dislike of change. We use familiar stories, like tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the book's death shows our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves."
6,C2,"For almost every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and started writing. I wrote about how some of the greatest minds in the last four hundred years found time each day to do their best work. I looked at how they organized their schedules to be creative and productive. By writing about the simple details of their daily lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I wanted to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to show that even famous artists have habits like us. 
The French food expert Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the conditions for creative work, not the work itself. It’s about how things are made, not what they mean. But it’s also personal. The writer John Cheever said you can’t even write a business letter without showing something of yourself. Isn’t that true?
In the book, I think about questions I struggle with: How do you do meaningful creative work while also making a living? Is it better to focus completely on one project or to work a little each day? When there isn’t enough time for everything, do you have to give up things like sleep or a clean house? Or can you learn to do more in less time, like my dad always says, ""work smarter, not harder""? I don’t have all the answers, but I tried to show how different successful people faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas come from small daily actions and how our work habits affect our work.
The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary, but it can also be a way to use limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine helps focus your energy and keeps you from being controlled by your moods. The psychologist William James thought you should put part of your life on autopilot. By forming good habits, he said, we can focus on more interesting things. Ironically, James himself often procrastinated and couldn’t stick to a schedule.
This book started because I was procrastinating. One Sunday, I was alone at the architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a morning person, good at focusing early but not after lunch. That afternoon, I looked online for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought someone should collect them. So, I started the Daily Routines blog and later wrote this book.
The blog was simple; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine articles, and obituaries. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the short and varied voices that made the blog popular. I let my subjects speak for themselves with quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t be possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
7,C1,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain because interest rates went up. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, on a rainy August day, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From that moment, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of university, he knew exactly what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He wasn't interested in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He wanted to study the very beginnings of life, looking at tiny creatures in ancient rocks.
After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard worried about finding a job. He knew he was talented, but he also knew that getting a job wasn't always fair. When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied, but he didn't expect much. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't make it because of an accident. The replacement professor didn't like the other candidate and helped Howard get the job instead. Howard was surprised and grateful, even after he learned the real reason he got the job. He was just happy to have a job doing what he loved.
Howard often thought about how his work was organized and planned, unlike the chaos of everyday life. He realized this when his briefcase, with important lecture notes, was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he went back to the college, postponed his lecture, and reported the theft. Then, he had coffee with a colleague and a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils there, which would become his biggest challenge and secure his career. If his briefcase hadn't been stolen, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding a way to visit the museum in Nairobi. 
*An ammonite is a type of fossil."
8,C1,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. These larvae might look like maggots, but they taste ""slightly nutty and floral."" Making bug-eating normal is just one of the many food challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. His research is quietly changing what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurants. Spence and other scientists study how we experience food and drink, a field informally called gastro physics. They look at who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates and cutlery, and even background noise, as all these things affect taste. 
Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting facts for anyone who likes to eat. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their food the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and not high-tech. ""Low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff,"" he says. There are soundproof booths that look like big safes, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a big food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less important in universities. But now, since the government wants universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research is seen as valuable. 
Spence is helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar, often because of government rules. He says it's in their interest to help customers live longer. Many companies make these changes quietly, so regular customers don't notice. ""Research shows that if you tell people about the changes, they focus on the taste and don't like it as much,"" he says. Spence met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a big food producer. People used to think science and food didn't mix, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal and Spence worked together on a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"" at Blumenthal's restaurant. 
Spence says that in the early 20th century, Italian futurists tried similar ideas, like using frog sounds with frog legs, but it didn't become popular. Now, the food industry uses Spence's sensory science in many products. For example, he found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. ""It's surprising when shapes affect taste, or when music changes how you taste a flavor,"" he says. An airline will soon match music with food served to passengers. Last year, a brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says happens often. 
What are dinner parties like at Spence's home? Once, they ate rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. ""We've had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and 10 different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all like his lab."
9,C1,"Our brains are busier than ever. We get a lot of information, some true and some not, and we have to decide what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in shops. Now, we do these things on our own. We try to manage our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. These phones help us fit as much as possible into every free moment. 
However, there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, or doing many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a brain expert at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another. This switching has a cost. We are not like expert jugglers; we are more like beginners trying to keep many plates spinning, worried they will fall. Even though we think we are doing a lot, multitasking makes us less efficient. 
Multitasking increases stress hormones, which can make our thinking unclear. It also makes us want more distractions. The part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex is easily distracted by new things. This is a problem because we need this part of the brain to focus. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our brain performance. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, calls this info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while having an unread email can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This loss is greater than the loss from being tired.
Russ Poldrack, a brain scientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to a part of the brain that stores skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is better organized and easier to remember.
Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to answer a text or not. Making decisions is hard for our brains, and small decisions can be as tiring as big ones. After many small decisions, we might make bad choices about important things.
When talking to business leaders and scientists, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not the email itself, but the large amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do that and get other things done."
10,C1,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not important. Scientists only looked at animal behaviors and their results. They did not think animals had feelings or morals. But now, this is changing. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals might have emotions. This idea is now being discussed in popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? In a study with cows, those that opened a gate to get food were happier than those that had help. If cows like solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? People disagree on what these observations mean. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature"", thinks we should stop eating meat. He believes we are close to a big change in ethics, like when slavery ended. Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler version of our mind. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. These views may never agree because the main issue is philosophical, not just scientific or moral. It is hard to define consciousness, so can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an experiment with starlings, a type of bird, that he thinks shows they can get depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were put in two groups. One group had nice cages, and the other had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid bad worms from another. Later, when only bad worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages ate them. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt pessimistic. Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, believes we will one day see our treatment of animals like we see racism today. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger. If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning wrote a textbook on animal behavior. He says we are seeing a change in how we think about animals. In the early 20th century, people thought animals were like humans, then they changed their minds. Now, we are changing again. It is a difficult topic, and people have strong opinions."
11,C1,"Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear better. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that people believe arguments help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve problems and make it harder to think deeply. West says we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More data doesn't always mean better knowledge or decisions. 
Reading books has decreased by 10%, and this might affect critical thinking, says Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor. She believes focusing more on visual media like TV and video games can reduce critical thinking because they encourage multitasking instead of focusing on one thing. We don't yet know exactly how technology affects critical thinking. Technology can be both good and bad, and different uses can lead to different results. For example, a computer game might help or hurt critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis, but too many links can stop deep thinking.
Greenfield says technology changes how we think. Reading helps imagination and critical thinking more than visual media. However, visual media can improve some information processing. But most visual media don't allow time for thinking or imagination. This can lead to people, especially young ones, not reaching their full potential.
How we see technology affects how we think about critical thinking. Video games and thinking skills are a big topic. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says video games can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and thinking skills in virtual worlds. These games let people explore ideas they might not be able to in real life. As reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,C1,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but left because he didn't like it. His first book talks about the good things about working with your hands. His latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. He realized that these ads are hard to ignore and take our attention away from what we want to think about. 
Crawford says that because of these distractions, we find it hard to think or remember past conversations. We try to avoid interruptions, so we stop talking to strangers. He believes that things like video games and phone apps are designed to grab our attention and can control us. Many people feel the same way. For example, some office workers complain about emails but still check them in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone on a table can distract us. 
Crawford thinks that technology makes it easy for us to focus only on ourselves. This affects how we interact with others. We prefer texting to talking because it's easier. By only interacting with screens, we might lose important social skills. 
He gives an example from his gym. Before, there was one music player for everyone, which sometimes caused disagreements. Now, people use earphones and listen to their own music, making the gym less social. Crawford believes that real connections happen when people work through differences together.
Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he thinks we should do activities that require skill and focus, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us connect with the real world and other people. They also help us focus better and feel more satisfied."
13,C1,"""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, we answer this question in a few words. But when you are a philosopher, like me, it is a bit harder to answer. Saying you are a philosopher can sound a bit arrogant. People might think you believe you have special knowledge or wisdom. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why do people think this way about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who think deeply and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) said that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, was the best life. Not many modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked with deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just following what everyone else does is not satisfying. Thinking about our lives helps us make our own choices. But you don’t need to read a lot of philosophy books or spend all your time thinking to live an examined life. It means looking closely at our daily experiences to see if they are important. You don’t have to be a wise person living away from society to do this. In fact, to help people, philosophy should be practical and shared with others. This leads to another reason people misunderstand philosophers: academic philosophy has become very separate from everyday life. This is partly because of how universities work. Philosophers often write for expensive and hard-to-read journals, so they don’t get to share their ideas with many people. For most people, philosophy seems far from real life. If philosophers used to fight this idea, many have stopped trying. Universities have created a place where philosophers are isolated, and many support this. Some areas of philosophy focus on very specific debates, making it hard for even other philosophers to understand, let alone the general public. Philosophy has, in some cases, moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about judging human actions. But I feel this title doesn’t fully explain my work. Ethics is often seen as about rules and laws. Recently, ethics has come to mean applied ethics, which looks at whether certain social practices are fair. Ethicists today try to decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or right. These are important questions, and I often think about them. But philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is wrong (it is) and then look at how we think about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps us look more closely at our actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find out things we already know; other times, we see that our beliefs are hard to defend. By examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,C1,"People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, philosophers have often talked about food to explain other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, bigger ideas. 
For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus talked about enjoying life and avoiding pain in many areas, not just food. But today, his name is often linked to a love of eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants and food websites because businesses think it will help them sell more if people believe famous philosophers approve of their products.
Food is a big part of our social and cultural life. It doesn't just appear; it comes from history and is shared with people around us. Our communities give us people to eat with and help grow and share food. We deal with food more often than any other thing, making it an interesting topic for philosophy.
Once food is ready, critics talk and write about it. But why do they have such an important role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill; food critics are just better at describing tastes. Philosophers have not studied taste as much as they have studied sight, and this should change.
Another part of food is its beauty. We say paintings or music are beautiful, but not usually food. Some philosophers think that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. But food is eaten and gone, unlike art, which lasts over time. So, some think food cannot be considered in the same way as art.
There are also many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices show our beliefs, and philosophers ask why we make these choices.
Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of love and friendship. At home, everyone shares food and time together. Professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are not open to everyone, only to trained people.
A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help connect different cultures. This happens in two ways: by enjoying each other's food and by eating together, which has been important in international diplomacy for a long time. The essay includes many interesting stories that make this part of food philosophy exciting for everyone."
15,C1,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He thought the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a story or if choices made in one game could affect the next game. He changed a classic board game called Risk to make a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made by players have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules. The game is played over several sessions, and past actions become part of the game. Daviau said, ""You could point to the board and say: 'Right here! You did this!'""
Daviau then worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players try to stop diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very popular, SeaFall was a big test for the legacy format because it was not based on an earlier game. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players explore and conquer new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said, ""It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to have problems, and you have to fix everything.""
Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Daviau thought it would only interest a few people. He said, ""I thought it was different and good, but strange and unexpected. I thought only a few people would like it."" However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it's a big step forward in game design. ""It's a new level of excitement,"" he said. ""There's nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play.""
Another fan, Ben Hogg, liked the adventure of legacy games. ""At first, I was worried about changing and damaging the board,"" he said. ""But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don't watch the same movie twice. You're buying an experience. It's like the stories in video games."" The legacy format is similar to video games and popular TV series. Daviau wanted to be a TV writer but ended up in game design. He still loves telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares making a legacy game to writing a book. ""You need to know how it starts and ends,"" he said. ""But you also need more than just an outline.""
Daviau feels proud of his idea but is curious to see what others do with it. He thinks gamers will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, believes the legacy format is a big change. ""It changes how you think about what a board game can be,"" he said."
16,C1,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online and seemed like something from a children’s movie. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think animals are like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very smart even though they look very different from us. Octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.
Some people think it is unscientific to say animals are like humans, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, disagrees. He says that ignoring the human-like traits of animals, which he calls ""anthropodenial,"" is more common. Research shows that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.
In the past, people believed animals were smart. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, scientists like Charles Darwin believed that the difference between human and animal minds was not very big. But in the 20th century, people started to see animals as simple machines that only responded to rewards and punishments. This view became popular when humans began destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.
Dr. de Waal believes we are now starting to understand animal intelligence better. He says that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide their nuts. In her book, ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we are not very smart because we cannot change the color of our skin.
Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean, but he knows that stories like Inky’s help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers got upset because grapes are better. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a short video of the experiment convinced more people of the findings. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways."
17,C1,"Robots used to be something we only read about in science fiction books. Now, they are becoming a big part of our world, changing how we work just like machines did during the industrial revolution. For many years, robots have been used in car factories and other manufacturing areas. But now, experts say robots will soon be used in many more areas, and many countries are not ready for this big change.
Most people agree that robots will change the way we work. About two-thirds of people think robots will do most of the jobs humans do now in the next 50 years. However, 80% of people also believe their own jobs will still be around in the same way. This is not true. Every job sector will be affected by robots in the coming years. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This is a job that would take two human workers almost a whole day to do. In San Francisco, a company called Simbe Robotics has a robot named Tally that moves around supermarkets to check if products are in the right place and priced correctly.
People who support robots say that robots cannot fix or program themselves yet. This means there will be new jobs for people who can work with robots. But some people worry that we are not ready for the changes robots will bring, especially the loss of human interaction at work.
Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing jobs. He says that in two years, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will have laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will go up by 60%, but many jobs will still be empty because there are not enough skilled workers.
Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be affected by robots. He says they should not wait for the government to protect their jobs but should learn new skills. People cannot expect to do the same job forever anymore.
New technologies will create new types of robots for consumers, like robots that live with us at home and interact with us in smart ways. This is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future. Countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it's there."" The reporter's question showed that many people are curious about why someone would do something so dangerous and seemingly pointless. Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams and face the unknown. It also suggests that climbing might be about adventure and fun.
In 1967, a Bolivian writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ""Games that Climbers Play."" He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He said that the way you climb, like using more or less equipment, should follow the rules of the specific climbing activity. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in the climbing community, influencing everything from climbing magazines to discussions around campfires.
Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. However, climbing can also be very limiting, like when you are stuck in a tent during a storm. This shows a contradiction in climbing: it can feel both freeing and restricting. But some people think that having fewer choices while climbing can make life simpler, which is a kind of freedom.
Joe Fitschen, a US rock climber, suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is part of our nature as humans. We like to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it's risky. This means the joy of climbing might be more about our biology than logical thinking.
Another idea comes from US academic Brian Treanor, who says climbing can help develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He thinks these qualities are important in today's world, which often avoids risk. Climbing can help people grow and live well even outside of climbing.
Some climbers believe that those who climb without help from others or technology must be very dedicated to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson argued that climbing is more impressive when done alone or without extra help, like bottled oxygen. This idea caused some debate because it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.
Finally, climbing can also be understood by looking beyond Western ideas. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone"" while climbing. The physical effort, the focus, and the problem-solving involved are similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,B2,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became very important in classical music. He was a serious and thoughtful person who focused on European piano music. He wrote and played a lot but did not teach much. People who knew him well saw he could be fun, but he was serious during concerts. His life was full of study, travel, and performances. 
Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take him seriously because he had not taught many students before. He thought of a saying: ‘You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something special about Kit, who was about 14 years old then. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played very well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital where he played beautifully. Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit’s performance was very rare and special.
As Brendel is retiring, Kit is starting his career, but Brendel is careful to make sure Kit does not get too tired too quickly. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new things like languages, math, computer coding, and playing tennis, with his mother always watching over him. He also writes music. Brendel says this is important because writing music helps you understand it better. Kit has an amazing memory and can read music very well. He listens carefully to his own playing and to Brendel’s advice. When Brendel explains something, Kit understands and can do it. 
Brendel is careful not to raise too many expectations. He gets upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century because it puts too much pressure on him. Kit can play some things very well, but he still needs more time and experience for others. Critics expecting perfection could be harmful.
Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. When I reached 50, I had done most of them, but I continued. Even though I don’t have the physical strength now, I still think about many pieces I never played. I don’t perform anymore, but it’s a nice new chapter in my life.’"
20,B2,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were beautiful places. My Grandad’s garden was not in a dirty city. It was next to a river and went gently down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – places to escape, find peace, and be alone. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic covering broken glass.
At home, my father was often quiet. He wasn’t without humor, though. He liked to say things like, ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ instead of just saying, ‘I don’t mind.’ He probably wished he had done more with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber. Plumbing wasn’t his passion; it was just his job. He wasn’t very ambitious, but he and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, though it didn’t happen. He was very good at fixing things around the house, like making bookshelves or cupboards.
My parents only moved house once, but my mother liked to change the furniture often. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when we got a piano. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I did like the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mom thought they were too fancy and took them away. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mom later why I didn’t get lessons, she said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’
I loved going to the river. I would go there with a fishing net and old sandals. I’d find a spot to take off my sandals and look for fish to catch with my net. After trying to keep them alive at home, I would put them back in the river. I wanted to leave school as soon as I could, but it didn’t seem possible until my dad said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ My dad usually didn’t like gardening, but he saw how much I loved it. I think he hoped it would be a good choice for me."
21,B2,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and so am I. A strong wind from the Atlantic is blowing hard, but Lawrence is not bothered. He is at home here. His sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and Lawrence gently pets him. Lawrence is showing me around his island. He points north and shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds raining on Rum’s big mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay,’ he adds. Suddenly, Lawrence says he needs to move his sheep because rain is coming our way. As we walk down the hill, he tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. We stop talking to herd the sheep. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to gather the sheep but is not doing well. Lawrence tells him to go right, but Tie goes straight into the flock, causing confusion. Lawrence sounds disappointed and says, ‘That will never do.’ The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny. Their son, Colin, takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter, Mary, runs the island hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They leave the house and come back only when they’re hungry,’ Mary says. But living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available sometimes. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, Mary prepares breakfast using a flashlight. I get used to it, along with having no mobile phone service. Mary tells me, ‘There is mobile reception on the hill. Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.’ So I do the same. Life on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians with instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their feet to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father bought a small farm on the Isle of Soay from a newspaper ad without seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know how to run a farm? ‘She was good at typing,’ Lawrence says. I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary, and by 7 pm, the fish is on the table, tasting amazing. I also think about my ferry ride the next morning to another island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months because of rough seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I would have to stay on Muck for two more days. Secretly, I hoped for that."
22,B2,"The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people. But now, the video games industry is taken seriously. This doesn't surprise experts. Making video games is not easy. When a new movie comes out, video games based on it need many team members and months of hard work. Like many industries, it's hard to get into, but it is growing.
Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it's hard to make progress in big companies or to have a say in big games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. They need not only directors who manage the whole game but also people who design parts of the game.
How can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim thinks differently. He says the only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won't get a job if you haven't created something. Game design is more a way of life than just a job. Like any creative work, you have to do it to make it real.
Another expert, John Field, sees other options. He agrees that making games is important, but it's more complicated. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry's needs. Even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and business ability to really make a difference.
Can you do it alone? John says it's possible but difficult. A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all kinds of entertainment and arts. They might have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and know how diverse games are becoming. Connections are important too. Networking can help you get ahead in games, just like in other fields.
The old idea of a teenage boy playing games all day is outdated. Now, games are seen as a grown-up activity. Families play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. Games are popular with large audiences and are a great way to learn. He sees many possibilities and opportunities in this area."
23,B2,"Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I'm thankful for that. I had a friend who came to the park with us, and his dad was very pushy. He always said, ""You can't do this, you can't do that."" My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and never played football again. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have been different. 
When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. Only by practicing can you score the great goals that feel so exciting. The best players in the world have amazing talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes you see young players bumping into each other, but I learned technique. When I teach kids, I try to show them how to enjoy learning skills. 
I used to play every sport at school. I joined in everything, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. Now I know it's important to get a good education, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn't notice it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope that when he kicks the books around, it doesn't mean he will be like me in that way.
At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so some of us younger players could play for the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never said, ""This is your big chance,"" but we knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a TV presenter said, ""You can't win anything with kids."" That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.
I rely a lot on close friends and family. But having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people say, ""I can't believe you let your mother keep working."" Of course, I've helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would be upset if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I like using my money to make life easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think, and it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I think I'll take a year off or maybe longer to do things I haven't been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."
24,B2,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. Sam was my dad's agent in Los Angeles. He was desperate to find us a cheap place to live because my dad couldn't write anything sellable in Los Angeles. This was bad for Sam because he could lose important clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point was not popular with day-trippers. The road was not nice, and the nearby resort, La Carmella, was more attractive for those with some money. Only people who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, many people came, and the place became lively. After months of being almost alone, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My dad was busy trying to write a script on time and was in a bad mood. He didn't notice that I spent most days on the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn't have a dog, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him water. My dad half-heartedly threw a boot at him, but Rusty didn't care and stayed closer. I asked my dad, ""Who do you think he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us."" My dad replied, ""You're wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes he brought things he didn't dig up, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. Rusty also liked to swim and always came with me, even though I could swim faster and farther. He never got discouraged. That day, we had been swimming. My dad, having finished his script, went to Los Angeles to deliver it. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in and out of the sea. As the sun set and it got cooler, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed tireless. They would choose a wave, stand on their boards, and ride it to the shore. One surfer stood out to me. She was very skilled and made the others look clumsy. She decided to finish for the day and rode a final wave to the shore. ""Hi,"" she said, ""why didn’t you join us?"" ""I haven’t got a surfboard,"" I replied. ""You could get one."" ""No money."" ""You’re British, aren’t you? Are you visiting?"" ""No, I live here."" ""Is your father American?"" ""No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he wrote."" ""No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?"" ""Rufus Marsh."" ""You mean, Tall as the Morning?"" I nodded. ""I read that cover to cover."" She looked at me with new interest, and I thought this was how it always was. People were friendly but not really interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,B2,"Violet Hetherington was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the ship Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this advice turned out to be wrong. An announcement said there was a problem with the computer system, which made the passengers upset. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service. Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left it there because all her contacts were saved on the phone. Her son Harry always warned her about this kind of mistake. 
Violet asked a friendly couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message, asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at her home. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn't tell Harry that. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding because he was forgetful too. 
Finally, the line started moving, and Violet gave her travel documents to board the ship. She felt disappointed when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were fake wood panels, lots of chandeliers, shiny brass, and carpets like those in airports. She followed signs to the elevators, which were full of tired passengers. Violet was squeezed against the side as the elevator stopped at each floor. At last, she reached the twelfth floor and was happy to find her room had the balcony she wanted. She had paid extra to make sure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,B2,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he didn't know he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures for a book about the history of Portage Park in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for taking interesting photos. Since then, Maloof has collected many of Maier’s belongings, including her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. 
One morning, Maloof looked at all these items and realized he had found something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I didn’t know what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily sold it all to someone else.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They talked to families who hired her as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed her film. 
Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. She returned to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be private and a bit unusual, always carrying a camera. She wore large coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘On her day off, she would leave with her camera in the morning and return late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ 
Maier knew a lot about theatre and movies. Although she wasn’t very social, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, sometimes recording them on audiotape. She seemed very focused on her ‘second job’ of capturing the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone stop her.’ Maier’s work was pure art; she didn’t do it for money. Her photos often showed women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. 
Photography expert Larry Silverman finds Maier’s pictures very interesting. He sees the influence of other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her style on her own. ‘Was Vivian very skilled, or did she take ideas from others?’ Maloof often wonders if he will ever look through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. 
Interestingly, Maloof wasn’t interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, he started taking his own pictures. ‘As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I realized it was about the people, the street scenes, and the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized it was more important than I ever imagined. Now, our goal is to make sure people know Vivian Maier’s name and get her into the history books.’"
27,B2,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she was calm even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are a series of crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complicated. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found that the past gave her more chances for her characters to face problems. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it’s nice to come from a small country because everyone feels proud of her success. She added that it’s annoying when people think her book is not serious. She wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. The book gets faster as it goes. I asked if it matters if readers notice this. She said she wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if readers cared, they could find them. Even with its unusual structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery with a gripping story. Surprisingly, she didn’t plan the book in advance. She would write herself into a difficult situation and then find a way out. She also wanted the book to be fun for readers. We talked about her love for TV drama series. I asked if she might want to write for TV. She said, ‘That could be pretty cool.’ She was very enthusiastic and laughed often. She loves talking about her work and New Zealand. She notices how her imagination changes when she is in different places. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busy places to be around more people. But for now, New Zealand will stay her home. I hope it gives her ideas for more books."
28,B2,"As a boy, Jonny Kinkead loved making things in his dad’s garage and playing the guitar. These two hobbies became his job for the last forty years: he builds steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny says, ‘I’m still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? And using different types of wood makes different sounds. It still surprises me.’
Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a holiday job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and woods changed the sound, and how to put them together.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ‘We drew model boats and airplanes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use tools like saws and chisels. I also fixed and customized instruments for my friends.’
Jonny’s bass guitar was good, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a job. ‘I also liked painting and sculpture,’ he says. After school, he decided to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he remembers. But halfway through, he left the course. ‘I was too independent for it,’ he says. ‘But I realized I wanted to build guitars. It’s like sculpture because you shape sound. And it seemed more practical than pure art because you make things people use.’
Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of the materials, but as he became known as a great guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just getting by.’ He can only make ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to become known. He went to music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his guitars, which was hard for him.
Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the best acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as good, even though we have always had good courses and skills here. But now, our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says you can learn valuable techniques in classes, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take courses. However, he also believes there is no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If someone else teaches you, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’"
29,B2,"When talking about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a tradition, and many writers mention Dr. Johnson's famous comment from the 18th century: ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. However, many people try to explain why English people talk so much about the weather and often fail. They think English people talk about the weather because they are interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says the English weather is not exciting, so he doesn't understand why people talk about it so much. He notes that England doesn't have extreme weather like tornadoes or blizzards. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you never know what weather you will get.
My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the point. English people don't talk about the weather because they care about it. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to start conversations and connect with each other. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not really about the weather. They are greetings or ways to start a conversation. This is similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially.
There are specific times when English people use weather talk. It can be a greeting, a way to start a conversation, or a topic to fill awkward silences. This means English people do talk about the weather a lot, which makes others think they are obsessed with it. An English conversation might start with weather talk, use it to break the ice, and return to it when there is nothing else to say. This is why people think English people are very interested in the weather."
30,B2,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were already interested because they chose this trip over trips to Spain, Greece, or France. But they really wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. When she couldn't find a historical novel to help explain life at the Wall in Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as a writer in 2001. She felt it was a big change. ‘Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very tiring. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but not as tiring. My old teaching friends are jealous because I still connect with children through my stories.’ Alice wants her books to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. ‘Many books for teenagers now are about negative experiences. They are well written,’ she adds, ‘but many are dark or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different.’ Alice always taught English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy. She loves seeing children go from being bored to interested and from not understanding to understanding. She sees her writing as a way to keep teaching. She was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher also suggested she try a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course I didn’t think I needed.’ Before the course, she had to send her best piece of fiction. She only found out a few days before she had to leave. ‘I sat at the computer and made up a story about a Roman couple and their baby.’ Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted. During the course, other students liked her story and suggested she publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and he helped her edit the novel. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re rival authors, but I think we work well together. He reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep adding more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,B2,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would be between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same place. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 
‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before. It’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold now, so I’ll be warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. Unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, Alistair wore full winter cycling clothes. He wasn’t worried about the cold. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he’ll even make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’
The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 meters up. This was not a problem for the car, but Alistair had a tough start with a steep hill. After a quick handshake, they began. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss, while Jonny got in the car and drove on the road. They would see each other again at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?
Jonny’s confidence was tested right away. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first problem. A big tractor came out of a field and blocked the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he said to the cameraman in his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!’ After the tractor moved, Jonny was back on the road, driving into the morning mist.
Alistair was having a hard time with the hill. A few miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side, the ground was open, and with the sun shining, he could go fast. He put his head down, feet on the pedals, and picked up speed.
In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The villages in this part of Yorkshire are very old, and the roads are not made for fast driving. Jonny had to drive slowly around a narrow corner and through a stream on the road. After the last village, the road was straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, coming to the finish from the other side. He reached the line and stopped. 
Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, ‘Is he here?’ When they said no, he raised his arms and said, ‘Yes!’ A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said, feeling disappointed. ‘I’m gutted.’"
32,B2,"Playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a unique experience. The first thing you notice is the silence. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hear the echo of your shot. The well-kept grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds make you feel like you are in a different world. This quiet helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to think only about the game and the point I am playing. When a point ends, the silence is broken by applause and cheers. I hear them, but they seem far away. I don’t really notice the fifteen thousand people watching me or the millions around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life.
I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach forever, taught me that this is the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends that I would play there and win one day. Before 2008, I played and lost twice, both times against Federer. In 2006, I was just happy to be there, even though Federer beat me easily. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have done better, and it was my mind, not my skills, that let me down. I cried a lot after that loss. Losing is always painful, but it’s worse when you know you had a chance. My uncle Toni, who is a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me, even when I win. But after that loss, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I didn’t believe him and thought it was my last chance to win. I know a professional athlete’s career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I felt I missed a big one in 2007. But Toni was right. I got another chance in 2008, just one year later. I was sure I had learned from my defeat and that my mind was ready this time. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends, but we didn’t talk about the match. They knew I was already thinking about it in my mind, and I needed to keep that space for myself until the match started."
33,B2,"In April 1957, a young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. She wrote home saying, ""I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made her famous with articles and TV shows about her research on chimpanzees. She also wrote popular books, including the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages.
Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes hides her real achievements. Many stories about her life focus on her adventures and dreams but miss the importance of her work. Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading scientist in her field. She helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.
Before her research, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We also did not know that they have emotions and social systems similar to humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her study in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves.
Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. When she was five, she disappeared one day, and her family and police searched for her. She was found with straw in her hair and clothes. Jane explained she wanted to know how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours to watch. This curiosity was an early sign of her interest in biology."
34,B2,"Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist who can speak in many different voices. During our first conversation, she used the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children's TV, cartoons, and even some work training videos. Recently, she did a voiceover about back injuries and had to quickly learn how to say many medical words.
Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. Many actors think they can do funny voices, and some can, but there is more to it. You have to make the script come alive for people who can't see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceover work, but they often don't get the parts because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.
After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning to become a regular actor. During the course, she sang jingles for TV ads. One day, someone at the recording studio asked her to try out for the voice of a rabbit in a cartoon. She thought it was silly but tried it for fun and got a big part. Shirley realized she was good at voices and decided to focus on voiceover work. In her second film, she played the main character and also her brother and mother.
Adult female actors often do voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter. Hiring child actors is complicated and takes a lot of time, which production companies want to avoid. Shirley has learned to make different sounds and collects new voices by watching children's TV. She enjoys working on cartoons the most, but she also does educational videos and adverts for things like vacuum cleaners. These can be hard because she has to sound excited about things she doesn't care about. She says smiling while talking makes her voice sound happy.
The competition for voiceover work is tough, and having a good showreel, which is a recording of what you can do, is very important. Shirley says it's worth investing in a strong showreel and there are agencies that help with this. She believes she succeeded through hard work and not just talent. Making a showreel, visiting film and TV companies, and practicing voices are all about setting goals and not giving up.
For those interested in voiceover work, Shirley suggests attending workshops that teach different types of voiceover. She loves voices and often becomes the characters she plays. Sometimes, after doing a certain voice in the studio, she keeps speaking that way for hours or even days. Her children are used to hearing her talk in different voices."
35,B2,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because being a cartoonist is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people give up these dreams and choose more realistic jobs, like becoming a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can make money by drawing doodles, like the ones in school notebooks, seems silly. But some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. 
For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons about local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to live on.
To become a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree, much money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are not high, but it’s still a hard job. You should only try to be a cartoonist if you feel you can't do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies.
The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t refuse any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about everything.
What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs at newspapers and magazines. But those days are almost over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create the work and sell it. The better you are at selling, the better you will do. I’ve seen cartoonists with average talent but great business skills do better than artistic geniuses who lack business sense.
It surprises me how many people have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they won’t let others see their work! To protect your work legally, just draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it’s not a disaster – it can actually be a lucky break!"
36,B2,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and getting rid of things I didn't need. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to get rid of this guitar? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man came up to me, looking confused. He asked, ""You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?"" I said I was, but I already felt a bit sorry. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways. 
In the years after, I often felt sad about what I had done. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. I felt the same way when I read the email from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes and sells guitars. He told me, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back of the guitar. He used my name to find me online and contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He offered to sell it back to me for a fair price. I almost cried with happiness. I had forgotten that my dad used to put name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this strange story!
My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s because it was very popular then. I loved its calming and gentle sound, and it was easy for beginners. But I didn’t make much progress, so I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn’t have to play well to be a rock star. When I got my old guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I stood up and put a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar is usually played standing up. My fingers remembered how to play, even though I couldn’t draw the chords. My fingertips felt the pain of pressing the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really for playing alone, so now I think I need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are other people my age with a similar story. We could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!"
37,B2,"There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who can't sleep well, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is getting more attention now. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them. We often lose dreams when we wake up early. The last hour or two of sleep, which we often miss, is mostly REM sleep, where we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM sleep, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM sleep. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night. This shows that dreams are important. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. But it wasn't that simple. Later research showed that dreams have physical origins, not just psychological ones. Now, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study. It found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He concluded that people who are interested in creativity use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says dreams help us connect things in new and surprising ways. They help us find new patterns and ideas. For example, when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They think in unexpected ways, which is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a dream I can barely remember seems to help me think better. On those days, words and ideas come to me quickly. I don't know how it works, but it does. Creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We all live in a complex world and need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,B2,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, you can see the sea and some empty frames on the walls, along with photos of her two daughters. Susie is a well-known copyist artist, which means she can paint copies of famous artworks. She can make a painting look like a 20th-century impressionist piece or a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait. However, she doesn't keep her own work because they are sold as soon as she finishes them.
Susie has been a copyist artist for 30 years and has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that even art experts sometimes think they are the originals. While the original paintings are worth millions, Susie's copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how long she spends on them. She has many clients, including galleries and private collectors, but she doesn't usually say who they are. Some collectors like to show off her copies as if they were the real thing. 
Susie is honest about her work. She tries to make her copies look as real as possible and signs her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as an original, and Susie has never done that. She knows people who have gotten into trouble for making fakes. Although she has had financial struggles, her situation is better now, and she doesn't want to risk her reputation.
Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden after finishing her art degree. She didn't earn much, but it helped her learn to be precise, which is important in her current work. She advises young artists to learn to draw accurately and study a lot. Susie can copy many styles, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. 
Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie says it's not. Impressionists painted quickly but were also very careful, which is hard to do well. Although Susie is very skilled, she doesn't create her own original art. She has tried, like painting fishing nets, but they looked too much like photos. Susie is a perfectionist and is happy with her work as a copyist."
39,B2,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything, except maybe being the fastest on it. She was obsessed with sailing since she was a child. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, normal life seemed unimportant, and people always wanted to know about the race. She quickly wanted to return to the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and workplace for 94 days. She explained how she planned everything carefully, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. Preparation was very important to her. She proudly showed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical items. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.
Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. She saw abandoned whaling stations and felt it was a warning about how we take what we want and move on. When I visited Ellen’s office, she explained why we need to act now to save the planet. She said, ""No one is making coal, oil, or gas anymore. They are precious and limited. We need to find ways to not use them up."" At first, her message was to use less, but then she realized we should focus on re-using. She talks passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, and talked to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says, ""but I love learning. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Sailing seemed selfish compared to this. This is about finding how my voice can help. It really matters.""
Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and schools to help young people think about a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It is a big part of who I am. At sea, you are connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on the record, on practical things, on survival. My new message is not as simple as saying, 'I’m going to be the fastest person around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I’ve ever done."""
40,B2,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become a very famous teenager. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to encourage kids to try outdoor activities. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.
Some experienced Everest climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They believe a young climber might be physically strong but might not be emotionally ready. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that – we have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.'
I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father wants him to? Paul says, 'This is not about me wanting to be famous because of my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later, but we decided, why not now? We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on reaching my goal.'
In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a chance to set a record. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This is a challenge for Jordan. People might say that focusing on records takes away the fun, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his story with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.'"
41,B2,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I am studying music at university, but even my classmates don't know much about classical music. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't have their music. The numbers are not good for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and classical albums sell only about 300 copies each. I find this hard to believe. Why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract many people, especially teenagers, who buy most music and concert tickets. Some teenagers do go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big fan of classical music. I like many types of music, but I listen to classical music only about 3% of the time. 
Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Experts say we can't focus for more than about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop songs also have lyrics that interest us more than long classical pieces without words. Classical music is powerful but doesn't talk about things teenagers care about. 
The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people are going to classical concerts now, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why people like classical concerts more as they get older, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might avoid it. Some say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They like classical music when they play it, but it's not their first choice when they relax. They prefer pop music."
42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too, but she didn’t hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t mind if her mother heard because she knew how Bonnie felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many different buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be kicked out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not start now?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. Bonnie liked horses and treated them well. The horses were well cared for, she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony as she touched its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best one here!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" said Bonnie, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They must be nearby."" The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, which made Bonnie happy. She enjoyed putting a saddle on Maverick’s back and forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed when she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m serious because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The movement was exciting, and the breeze made her cheeks glow. She felt Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,B2,"I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by how quietly confident he is. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia who has already released many successful songs. How did a relaxed surfer end up performing on stage for thousands of fans? Cody explains, ‘I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven.’ He remembers how it all started. ‘But I was swimming every day and surfing. Those were the things that mattered most to me back then. I had my life planned and lots to do. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online.’ These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, saying they wanted more videos. So Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The responses were amazing. Cody was also a very good swimmer. He trained hard with top coaches and focused on improving his sport. But then record companies contacted him, and he had a tough choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming, or take a big risk by signing a music deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ‘It was very hard for me – especially at such a young age – to choose a career. Can you imagine, at 12 or 13 years old, trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?’ He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ‘It was a big surprise to most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,’ he says, remembering their shocked faces. ‘I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world.’ So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody says it’s important to have great people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, we all have days of doubt. ‘Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, “How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?” My little brother is eight years old, and he’s travelling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,’ Cody admits. ‘I worry about that sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they’re here to support and encourage me in everything I do.’ Success, in any career, comes from being willing to say ‘yes’ to your big chance, even when it’s a bit scary. ‘It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,’ Cody says. ‘Now, to be going to countries I never thought I’d visit and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever.’"
44,B2,"I jumped out of bed, lifted the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. There was a new crack in the ice shining in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked towards the sandbags that were there to stop the buildings from flooding when the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting the sandbags. Last week, I worked with many people from the town for long hours to show I could do it. But my grandfather didn’t seem to notice. 
With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile of dark water made by the factory in Milltown. There was ice on both sides, and then solid ice downstream. As I took off my pajamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for my lucky chain – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It’s better than having a famous grandfather because only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I touched the chain again and went to the kitchen.
‘Morning, Rex,’ Mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ My wetsuit should have made that clear. He sees me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s getting harder. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom came over with a kind smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say he’s always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me photos of him in National Geographic. Those old photos are still on his wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now, and maybe one day, my own photo in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay close to him, even though he’s grumpy. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my trip.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I hurried to the boathouse in the backyard."
45,B2,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unfinished painting by Grandpa. It was different from his other works. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. It showed a river, but not one she knew. It might not even be a real river, just an imaginary one. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green. The eye was drawn to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant scene. Yet, Jess was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, hiding her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? I mean, for him to be so specific. Maybe he will add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" ""Someone who gives an artist ideas."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint. He would say the muse wasn't being kind to him or that he needed to be nice to the muse for a difficult part. He never suggested the muse was her. She thought he meant a goddess, not a person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,B2,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet by itself. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I will cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm unlucky that way.
What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's very cute! It's small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her cabinet, so I was very excited when she gave it to me!
But the cabinet is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it has to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But Angela is only fifteen, so I think I'll be in my small room for a long time. I don't really mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to fit Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it...
Then I had an idea. If I couldn't cut the cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this ""lateral thinking."" I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,B2,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house. They secretly take things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' view, not the humans', which made filming more difficult. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully strange. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act at all. One important thing for me was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit down during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off because she was sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t very accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,B2,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren't there. I wonder how long it will take before things get crazy. It always happens: fake smiles, people pretending to be friends, and asking for free tickets to my dad's concerts. ""Everything's going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the rest of the band is here for recording, we're staying for good. I chose this school because I want to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal.
I walk into the school's main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the school secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not looking very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That's one good thing. Not many people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it's printing,"" she says. Then she hands me the paper. English Literature is my first class. Cool, I like English. It's my favorite subject. I'll be late, though. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn't get lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already calling roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I quietly slip in and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! No one will suspect anything now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn't have worn these. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them, she tells us about the books we need to read this year and gives us time to talk to each other. All teachers should do this. ""So why'd you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many choices. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out soon anyway. But at least I can pretend to be normal for a while. ""He's an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I'm Becca, by the way."" And she doesn't seem to care. Excellent."
49,B2,"The average American teenage girl today is expected to do many things. She should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what being a teenager in America is like now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and be average. Being average is not enough anymore. If you don't have big goals, people might think you are lazy. 
Teenager Kristen Loose says, ""People, especially adults, forget how much pressure teenagers have these days. We have lots of homework, tests, activities after school, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. We also try to have a social life."" Even though these pressures are normal for teenagers today, people still have negative ideas about them. The media often shows teenagers as lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might be like this, it is not fair to say all teenagers are the same.
Kristen Loose says that many people think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She thinks this is not true. She admits she keeps her phone close most of the time, but not just for fun. It helps her and other teenagers manage their busy lives. Today, students are expected to have quick access to information and be reachable all the time, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their work anywhere. They might listen to language lessons instead of music on the way to school. Schoolwork and activities now need attention all the time, not just at school, which makes teenagers very busy.
Many teenagers start their day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the nine hours of sleep recommended each night. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20% of teenagers get enough sleep. Also, 28% of teenagers said they fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are so tired.
Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen does not spend much of this time on social media or TV. She likes to volunteer. ""People think teenagers only care about themselves,"" Olsen says. But she enjoys helping others and making a positive impact in her school and community.
In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers might change, but they will still be proving it wrong and making the world better. There will be a new generation of students who will make a big impact before they even finish school."
50,B2,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the past few years, this group has sent more than fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a science project with a fun twist: it’s part astronomy experiment and part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to launch a high-altitude balloon to try to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside, there is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to check temperature changes. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find the lunch box later. A gas tank, given by someone from a nearby state, is used to fill the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy drove seven hours to get the gas tank. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time to launch. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they count down, and the balloon starts to rise. Some of them run and follow it with flashlights until they can't see it anymore. There is a quiet and a shared feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside and look at the clear sky. It’s hard to believe they are just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city with about 4 million people. I see a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep quickly. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in a remote area. ‘To me, finding the lunch box is a big part of the program,’ says the group’s leader, who notes they’ve lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. Then they had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. ‘These students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild and dangerous to some is just normal life to them.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It’s a bit disappointing, but it’s also a chance to talk about atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. And it’s another adventure story to share with others."
51,B2,"Chloe Morgan admits that she wasn't interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. Her interest started by accident. Her younger brother was very interested in dinosaurs, a common interest for kids, but Chloe wasn't. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. This article amazed her, and she realized she wanted to learn more about it.
Chloe was curious about how she got support because Palaeontology wasn't a common career choice for young people then. She remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous. Chloe was nervous at first, even though Matt was known to be friendly. She worried he might think she was just a kid bothering him with questions. But he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.
Chloe talks about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. She admits that films like Jurassic Park have made people more interested in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She thinks movies often show palaeontologists as either strange geniuses or awkward people who can't relate to others. Films don't show what their work is really like.
Chloe's job is very varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs, analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. She also thinks it's important to explain science to the public. She likes to talk to young people about science to help them understand it better. Talking about dinosaurs can get kids excited about the natural world and help them learn about other sciences.
Chloe worked on the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs. She says the program makers knew what they were doing, and she was there to give advice if needed. She mostly checked that the dinosaurs shown lived in the same time period. The program was successful because it showed dinosaurs in a new, realistic way.
Chloe believes dinosaurs fascinate us because they appeal to our sense of adventure and discovery. Even though our world seems smaller now, prehistoric creatures remind us there's still more to learn. Palaeontology is like a form of time travel."
52,B2,"I'm going to say this once: when you're traveling by car with your family, even if you're six years old, you probably know you're not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" And when you finally arrive, it's not ""there"" anymore; it's ""here."" So, if you think you might be ""there,"" you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" I'm sure no one wants to be ""there"" more than the parents who hear that question over and over during long car trips. 
Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, mom or dad is there to give you juice boxes and cookies, change the radio station, and make sure everything goes smoothly. 
""Are we there yet?"" I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying—like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. I put my foot on his side, and soon we're fighting. The driver and the person in the front seat separate us and tell Tim to stay in his own seat. Things calm down for a while, and the scenery continues to pass by. 
Later, I'm trying to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. But the window isn't open. It's Tim, blowing air on me from his side. He's not touching me, so he thinks he's not doing anything wrong. I get angry, Tim gets in trouble, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again—for now. 
Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he often says, ""Yes, we're here. Get out of the car."" We say, ""But Dad, we're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour."" He replies, ""Oh, maybe we're not there yet."" That keeps us quiet for a while. 
You know you're finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move far away from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is no, you're not there yet."
53,B2,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using phones or gadgets. She believes it's natural for people to be together and talk to each other.
The games in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, now called Catan, created by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements on an island and trade resources, keeping everyone involved until the end. This idea was improved in 'co-operative' games, where players work as a team to win or lose together, which encourages more social interaction. 
One popular co-operative Eurogame is Pandemic, created by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by another Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He remembers playing it with friends and feeling excited, even if they lost. He wanted to create a game that gave the same feeling.
Leacock loved board games since he was a child, even though he often felt disappointed by them. With help from his uncle, he started designing better games. Pandemic became very successful, and its next version included more storytelling, similar to video games where characters develop and the world changes.
Interestingly, the growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games. Many people now play games on their phones, making them more open to playing board games too. Ben Hogg, who works for a games company, says that almost everyone with a smartphone plays games.
In the past, video games allowed people to play together in the same room. But now, many video games are played online, where players are not physically together. This has made some people look for games they can play with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun. In our online world, they offer a way to connect with others in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,B2,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many challenges. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him start playing the guitar. The only radio station he heard at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced him as he grew up. He says he was 12 before he heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. He says, ‘With tennis, I was at a high level, but it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was too much hard work.’ At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to make music, saying he wrote lyrics in economics lessons and played the piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed; if not, he had to get a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. But record labels wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. In the end, he became famous behind the scenes, not on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not come. He says, ‘In my artist career, I was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, I was in the right place at the right time.’ Writing for others is where he found success. He says, ‘I’d like to think I am one of the main writers in the UK that labels send new artists to.’ This helps start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that writing songs for the charts is okay. He asks, ‘Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?’ He believes they should write songs that are amazing and likely to sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone speak honestly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he just knows he wants to write number one songs and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goal. He says, ‘When I go into the studio, we need to aim for global success and write the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.’"
55,B2,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online, but people who don't watch online videos of bike stunts might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist.' This means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online.
I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys knew who he was, and even older people came to say he was 'an absolute legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, Tony explained what he wanted to do, and I wasn't always sure he could do it. But he did, and when I praised him, he didn't seem very excited. Even though he is famous online, Tony doesn't like being a celebrity. He says, 'I find it hard to be social. I know it's important to talk to fans, but I prefer doing things instead of talking about them.'
Tony's fame comes from social media and new camera technology. He says, 'This technology helps people like me make a living.' But he also feels that everyone is always looking at screens, and he doesn't like that. Still, he is happy because he can make money from what used to be just a hobby.
From my experience with top athletes, I know two things are important to become great: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent. In risky sports, you need mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on easy obstacles. But he got up and tried again until he succeeded.
Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport. They don't know the technical details or that he gets advice from experts to stay safe. Tony is careful about risks. He says, 'Some people never get scared, but they shouldn't do these sports. It's good to know the dangers. Some people can't get over fear, but I can. I plan and prepare a lot. Sometimes I ride around to get ready before a new stunt. I know I can't lose my nerve before I jump. If I fully commit, I'm fine.'"
79,C2,"One of the most interesting changes in education in the UK and around the world is encouraging students to start doing research early in their studies. This idea is that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists, but it is a natural way to learn and build skills. Research skills are useful not only in school but also in jobs because they help us think about the world and do our work better.
As a student, you help create knowledge. You don't just learn and repeat it; you make it. Making knowledge means asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are part of what we call research.
Research can be very complex and done by experts, but it can also be simple and part of everyday life. For example, when you plan a holiday, grow plants, fix things at home, or choose the right music system, you are doing research. At college, you are expected to have an enquiring mind, find problems and questions, explore information, and create your own ideas.
Some students might find this difficult because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as something you get from teachers and books without questioning. But in the UK, US, and many other places, it is important to question what you learn and who teaches it. This might seem challenging, but it is a key part of learning.
Critical thinking is very important in research. We need to not just repeat what we read but think about it, test it, and see if it makes sense. We should not just accept information without questioning it."
80,C2,"Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafés. But living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.
Scientists are now studying how living in a city affects our brains. They found that city life can make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees. Even a small view of nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from city life.
More people now live in cities than ever before. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a busy city street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and the city layout. This constant attention is tiring because our brains have to decide what to focus on and what to ignore.
Natural places are different. They don't need as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He said that being in nature helps our brains relax and recover. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens.
Long ago, people like philosophers and landscape architects knew cities could be harmful. They tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can help our brains work better in just a few minutes. While people try many things to improve brain function, like energy drinks or changing office designs, simply walking in nature is very effective.
Despite the problems of city life, cities keep growing. Even with technology, cities are still places of new ideas. Research shows that the busy and crowded parts of cities, which can make us lose focus, also help create new ideas. The many social interactions in cities lead to creativity. Just like 18th-century London, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of innovation.
The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. Because sometimes, people still want to leave nature and go back to the city."
81,C2,"Where should we look for the mind? Many people think that the mind is only inside our heads. Today, we have advanced machines that can take pictures of the brain to show this. But I believe that the study of the mind should not stop at the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, that objects and tools also play a part in how we think. Archaeology shows that things like stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and in shaping the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head can also be part of the mind.
It is easy to think that the mind and the brain are the same because most studies look at people without the objects they usually use. This makes sense for scientists who study the brain because they need to use special machines. But this means we often forget that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I am not saying that the brain is not important for thinking, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It is helpful to think that human intelligence spreads out into the world and culture around us.
This is where my new idea, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how these ways have changed over time and what that means for how we think. This gives us a new understanding of what minds are and what they are made of.
Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The stick and the person become one, showing how the mind and objects can be connected. The stick helps the blind person feel the world, turning touch into sight. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. This example shows that human intelligence can change a lot by using new tools and technology.
I see the human mind as always changing and evolving. Throughout history, from the first stone tools to the internet, tools have helped humans understand and interact with the world. For humans, tools are not just for getting food, like a monkey using a stick, but for learning and exploring. This is why humans make things and why those things help shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity, meaning our minds change as they interact with the world.
MET offers a new way to understand how different tools, from ancient axes to modern smartphones, have helped define and change who we are and how we think. Technology that changes the mind might sound like science fiction, but humans have been using it since we first evolved."
82,C1,"Photography is one of the most important inventions that changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography quickly became a big part of the culture. It was used in many areas like science, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians say photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. Photography became very important in the US, and to understand its impact, we need to look at its start in the mid-19th century.
Why was photography so popular? First, it was a mechanical process, which matched the US's love for technology and change. Just like steam power and railroads made the world feel smaller, photography brought images of the world into people's homes quickly. Second, the camera was a tool to show personal and national identity. It helped people create and keep memories of themselves and their families, even if these memories were a bit idealized. Third, photographs were realistic and matched the US artists' focus on everyday life.
Photographs draw attention to what the photographer wants us to see. They are records of events, people, and things, showing what was in front of the camera. This gives photographs a sense of objectivity. However, because a person takes the photo, it also shows their point of view, or subjectivity. People often think photographs are a 'universal language' because they recognize the subject. But understanding a photograph is more complex. We need to consider the context, like captions or where the photo is shown, to understand its meaning.
To understand a photograph historically, we should think about why it was made and how people first saw it. The same photo can have different meanings in different places and times. In recent decades, artists like Andy Warhol have used photographs in their art in many ways. Photography has become an important part of art, working together with painting to show how we see the world."
83,C1,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we have some idea of what mental life means. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is mostly about humans. James believed human psychology includes thoughts, feelings, the physical world around us, and how we understand these things. Our understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences, which may not always match scientific facts. 
We often act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on why people behave in certain ways, like feeling insulted or unhappy. Problems occur when people see things differently. Formal psychology tries to find the best explanations for these situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between personal opinions and scientific facts. 
Psychology studies the mind and brain, but we don't fully understand the brain's role in our thoughts and actions. Psychologists learn more by observing behavior and making guesses about what happens inside us. Studying psychology is challenging because we can't see the mind directly. We have to guess what is happening based on behavior, like solving a puzzle. Psychologists use careful observation and logical thinking to understand complex interactions. 
The goals of psychology are to describe, understand, predict, and control behavior. Once these goals are met, psychology can help improve people's lives. For example, it can help teach children to read better, design safer machines, and support people with emotional problems. 
Psychological questions have been around for a long time, but scientific study of them began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or looking into one's own mind, to find answers. However, this method has limits. As Sir Francis Galton said, it only shows a small part of what the brain does automatically. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on observing others' behavior rather than just their own thoughts."
84,C1,"In a simple building in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows products that nobody wanted to buy, like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and Carol Sherry is in charge of it. She believes each product tells a sad story about the people who designed and sold it. 
The museum is surprising because it makes money, even though it shows products that failed. You might think companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but they usually don't. Many business leaders visit the museum because they don't like to think about their failures and didn't keep samples of their own unsuccessful products.
The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who used to work in marketing, wanted to collect a library of consumer products, not just failures. Since the 1960s, he bought a sample of every new product he found. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection mostly includes unsuccessful ones.
Today's culture often focuses on being positive, which might explain why these failed products exist. People in meetings might not realize a product will fail, or they might keep spending money on it to try to make it succeed. They often don't spend time figuring out what went wrong.
This focus on optimism is common in the self-help world, where people believe that imagining success can make it happen. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that people tend to think things will go better than they actually might. Her research shows that people who are not depressed often have an overly positive view of their ability to change things.
Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen studied whether thinking positively about the future helps. Her research found that imagining success can actually reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people who thought they would have a great week at work ended up doing less.
Psychologist Carol Dweck says our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. Some people think ability is fixed and can't change, while others believe it can grow with effort. People who think ability is fixed find failure very upsetting because they see it as proof they aren't good enough. On the other hand, people who believe in growth see failure as a chance to improve. Dweck compares this to weight training: muscles get stronger by being pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."
85,C1,"Sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. On the other hand, people who invest money in sports wonder if home advantage should matter. They think that if players are paid well, they should play well anywhere.
What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in another country to reach more fans? It would matter to British fans who believe their support helps the team win. Fans often think that when they cheer loudly, it leads to goals. But they forget the times when their cheering didn't lead to success.
There is one thing that fans do that seems to affect the game. They often try to influence the referee. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees might avoid making decisions that would upset the home crowd.
Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are very similar. However, these changes happened recently, and home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because basketball relies more on teamwork, which is stronger at home.
Another reason for home advantage could be related to players' testosterone levels. Studies found that these levels are higher before home games, which might be a natural urge to defend their home ground. This was seen in the Rugby World Cup, where home teams won against stronger opponents by showing determination and aggression. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,C1,"""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important to athletes and their coaches. The saying is interesting because its meaning is not clear. Player didn’t really mean he got lucky; he meant that practice makes him better. This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate, which asks if talent is something you are born with or something you learn. 
Many people believe practice is more important than natural talent. This idea comes from psychologist Anders Ericsson, who said that you can become an expert in anything with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory became popular through books like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers"" and others like ""Talent Is Overrated."" These books say practice is the most important thing, and 10,000 hours is enough to become an expert.
However, in his book, Epstein argues that this is not always true. He shows many examples to explain his point. He says that studies often only look at successful people and try to explain why they are successful. Epstein asks if there are other ways to understand why some people have certain skills and others don’t. He explores how much of talent is natural and how much comes from environment, support, and hard work.
Epstein travels around the world to find answers, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to Alaska. In Alaska, he learns that the husky dogs’ drive in a sled race might be partly genetic. This suggests that determination might also be something you are born with, not just a choice. 
Epstein talks about the difference between ‘hardware’ (natural talent) and ‘software’ (learned skills). He believes both are important for top athletes. He doesn’t ignore the importance of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest runner. But Epstein also looks at cases where natural talent is very important. 
He also discusses race and gender. He asks why men and women compete separately in sports if only practice matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most important."""
87,C1,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her book, ""Kith,"" she explains that children spend too much time indoors, watching TV or using computers, and have lost touch with nature. Griffiths believes this is the main problem. Other studies agree, showing that children would be happier if they could play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their childhoods fondly, when they played outside all day, which they think was healthier than how children live now. However, these adults are the ones who have made life more protective for their children, worrying about safety and risks.
Griffiths argues that fear of danger keeps kids indoors, which benefits companies selling toys and gadgets. She also criticizes the trend of giving children medicine for being restless or making them wear goggles for playground games. She questions how common these rules are but expresses her strong opinions clearly. Griffiths also talks about the importance of childhood freedom, like in fairy tales and school rules. However, she sometimes takes her ideas too far, comparing modern treatment of children to racism, which seems exaggerated.
Griffiths is very romantic about children, seeing them in an ideal way. She believes children should have freedom to explore and take risks, learning from small accidents to avoid bigger ones later. But she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are small. Also, not all children want to be adventurous. Some are naturally shy and prefer staying home. The real issue might be forcing all children to live the same way, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,C1,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my education. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play. Those that have more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, and moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We do not need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate problems, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring for them, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit if they want. This makes play democratic. School has become harder: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must solve children's problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, warnings from experts, less community, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change this trend. We must give childhood back to children. They need to play and explore to grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,C1,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect directly with employers. In the past, people had to do things like stand outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign to get noticed. But with more access to employers, there is also a bigger chance to make mistakes.
For example, a young person in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the young person thought they could help him get a job. However, the executive was not happy with this request. She did not want to share her contacts with a stranger and sent a harsh rejection note, which became very popular online. Many people who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might regret how she wrote it. But this situation can teach young people to be more careful when using social media for work. It shows that social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly.
There is an irony here because social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When I was a teenager, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress others and try new things. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. You could change your image with a new profile picture or song on Facebook. But using social media for work is very different, and some young people do not see the difference. We learned to be bold and confident online, which might be why some of us still act this way. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. We need to understand that what we learned about social media as teenagers does not work for job hunting. We must meet employers' expectations to succeed in the job market.
One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too familiar and seem arrogant on professional networking sites. This makes older people think of us as an ""entitled generation."" But in reality, many young people are desperate to find jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances of getting a job, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable workers.
So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach gives you a better chance of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, mass emails, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the person you are contacting. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful connections, but you need to be careful to avoid closing doors."
90,C1,"'Anyone who says they can predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people buying most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre says that newspapers are now the main news source for only 26% of people, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people predict that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist said books and theatre were finished, and newspapers would become the most important part of social life. But theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has done well even with TV, and cinema has stayed popular despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales up 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main way to get news. This happened because it became possible and affordable to produce news for many people in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railway, and telegraph. Also important was the idea that everything is always changing, and we need regular updates, which was not common in medieval times. Now, we expect change. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and big events like famine or disease, which they couldn't predict. Life was seen as repeating cycles, as writer Alain de Botton says. Journalism as a job you could live on didn't really exist before the 19th century. Even then, there was no clear reason why people needed news regularly. Publishing newspapers regularly and in a fixed format can be a problem. Online news lets readers check news when they want. Search engines and algorithms help us find news that interests us. When big news happens, online news can update us minute by minute. Mistakes can be fixed quickly, and there is no limit on space for stories. This is very different from newspapers. But many online news providers focus on being first with the news and getting lots of comments, which can add to confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in busy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. In some ways, we are going back to that. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might disappear. Or, as the internet makes us feel like we live in a chaotic world, newspapers might find a way to help us understand things better.'"
91,C1,"If humans were comfortable under the moon and stars, we would enjoy walking in the dark, just like many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This is a basic part of who we are, even if we don't often think about it. We have changed the night by filling it with light, similar to how we control a river with a dam. This has benefits but also causes problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. Light pollution happens mostly because of poor lighting design, which lets artificial light shine into the sky instead of focusing it on the ground. This extra light changes the natural darkness of night, affecting many living things, including us. It can disturb activities like migration, reproduction, and feeding. 
In the past, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800. It was the most populated city on Earth, with nearly a million people using candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no public gaslights in the streets yet. From a few miles away, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. 
We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but it is not. Many animals, especially mammals, are active at night. Light is a strong force in nature and attracts many species. For example, songbirds and seabirds can be drawn to bright lights on land or at sea, flying around them until they are exhausted. Birds migrating at night might crash into tall, brightly lit buildings, and young birds on their first journey are especially at risk. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd times because of artificial light.
People used to think light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. Most of us don't need a perfect view of the stars, but we do need darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can cause health problems. The regular cycle of day and night is a natural part of life, and disturbing it is like changing our balance. In the end, we are affected by light pollution just like animals near bright lights. By creating so much light, we have lost touch with our natural and cultural heritage – the stars and the natural rhythm of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, which we can best understand by looking at the night sky with the Milky Way above us."
92,C1,"The founder of a big international company recently said that his company will stop keeping track of how much paid holiday time employees take. This idea came from an internet company that did something similar. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. Some people think this announcement is just a way to make the company look good, but we should ask: is this idea practical?
The internet company and the big international company are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the big company has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn’t hurt the business"" might work better in a smaller company where people know each other’s work better. In a big company, it’s harder to know if your absence will cause problems.
The founder of the big company said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work is up to date and their absence won’t harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? Even if you finish your work before a holiday, there will always be more work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works. People might feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress and lower productivity over time.
There might also be pressure from coworkers and office gossip about who is taking time off and for how long. In many companies, especially in the corporate world, there is a culture of working late. This could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where people compete for promotions. If the feeling of safety that comes with having a set amount of leave is removed, people might feel they can’t take the leave they need because they don’t want to seem lazy. They would no longer have their legal right to rely on.
Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime and anywhere, making it hard to separate work from free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how this new way of working could fit with the old time-off policy. They wondered why the company should track time off if it couldn’t track work hours accurately. But if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might feel like they are always being watched, which could be harmful.
Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits like better morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can happen without affecting worker well-being. I am not sure if letting employees ""take as much holiday as they want"" is really what the company wants or if it will actually happen."
93,C1,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This is to make sure the research is good and not flawed. Scientists often say this process is important to keep trust in published research. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure the research is trustworthy? The answer is both yes and no. 
The world of scientific publishing is changing. I still believe in peer review, but things are shifting. Preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review, are becoming more popular. They allow new research to be shared quickly so others can read, critique, and build on it. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can affect the motivations of authors and reviewers. Scientists compete to publish in top journals, which can lead to cutting corners and leaving out important data. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good. 
These issues are known, but few people want to change the current system. Preprints might be a solution because they don't require a big change. Although preprints have been around for twenty years, they are not widely used. This is partly because scientists think journals won't accept papers that have been shared as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review will lead to bad science, but this hasn't happened yet. 
Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but they are open for critique by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper critiqued another paper, which is hard to do in traditional journals. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and all comments were public. This way, readers can judge the quality of the arguments. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments are still available, so the work is not wasted.
Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing they are effective for sharing research. By using the internet's openness, preprints help focus on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,C1,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it’s like ‘a painting in words’. These answers don’t usually satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to pick an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist would, and another paragraph from the object’s point of view, calling it ‘Poem’. Here’s what one student wrote:
Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and only for a short time. Most people will never need me.
The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to a good discussion. When I was in school, poetry didn’t make much sense to me. I thought every poem was a confusing puzzle that stopped me from really understanding and feeling. After school, most people find poetry less interesting. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it’s not like regular writing. It almost challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down because it seems boring or hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying.
What do we want from the poems we read? Isn’t a poem supposed to be full of deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem to be yes. But if we want to cry, we watch movies; for information or strong opinions, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. But there is one thing a poem can offer: ambiguity, or uncertainty. Everyday life is full of it, just like reading a poem can be. But these ideas still don’t explain what a poem really is.
If you search online for ‘poem’, it takes you to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of literary art that uses the beauty and rhythm of language’. This is a fancy way to say it, but it doesn’t show the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes say poems are like wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or like machines – carefully made by humans – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t always work. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps us think differently and see common things in a new way.
Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially if we think about how song lyrics can get stuck in our heads. The mix of words and music is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes such as ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, looking right at you: A poem can touch us like nothing else, even though, as ink on paper, it does the same as the prose around it. What about all the empty space around the poem – space that could be used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it doesn’t become a product to sell. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry books, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not made for the market, but for itself. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,B2,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I have enjoyed finding every brooch and coin because it makes me feel connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.
One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming tools. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, I saw it was a thick, beautifully patterned loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a twisted necklace made of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring like the one I found.
I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. I called Marion and showed her. She stopped and asked, ""What is it?"" I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I was worried. Later, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.
The law says you must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before giving it up, so I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was checked and later sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just money. It's something I saved for the nation. People ask if I will stop detecting now that I've found something amazing. But those brooches and coins are still interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing. There's always a chance of catching a bigger fish tomorrow."
96,B2,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy travel plans, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rain and lazy mornings in Italian beds. Sleeping better is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, in a new place with different smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and have dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I think there's more to it than just relaxing. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. We experience different cultures, music, and landscapes. While sleeping, we process all these new experiences. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with each place we visit. People often worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs is harder than changing time zones. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep schedule. Once I do, I feel like I truly belong there. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all felt sleepy and lay down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why they had so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I didn't just sleep; I shared a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Being in a different place with new smells and sounds makes sleep feel luxurious. If ""slow travel"" means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should stop feeling guilty and tell my friends that sleeping while traveling is an activity too."
97,B2,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said kindly to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face like a bulldog. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little hat will make me stand out."" She touched the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change the woman's mind. Smiling, she agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. It had been a while since everyone was together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, who they knew nothing about. Her husband Jeff had quickly pointed out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff said, ""What kind of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" ""It sounds pretentious,"" Jeff said. He didn't like anything showy or fake. He also didn't like Mia's way of being too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a trash can lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and went into Medlar House through the back door. Her walk from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia decided to turn the empty barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends that finding the perfect hat for a special occasion was hard, so she was sure there was a demand. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in the village of Little Pelham. In a friendly place, they could try on many hats to find the right one. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits so everything matched. She recently started selling handbags and costume jewelry too."
98,B2,"It's a long way from London to Atlanta. In his new American home, Lawrence Okoye thinks about his amazing sports journey. He is confident but surprised by how far he has come—from an Olympic discus final to a new challenge. Even though he has never played American football before, Lawrence might be chosen for a big USA team. In Atlanta, he is learning about his new position in the sport. It seems unbelievable that a 21-year-old from London could be picked for one of the top American teams, but Lawrence is used to surprising people. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on discus instead. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence first went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training to prepare for the world championships. He says, ""American football was in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then."" After arriving in America, he read about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ""Pretty much,"" he says. ""I went online and applied."" Was he nervous about competing with experienced players? ""No,"" he says. ""I don't get nervous about many things."" Lawrence is not very talkative, but he believes in his abilities. His test results were so good that he was seen as the most impressive player. ""I was very happy to hear that,"" he says, showing a bit of pride. But he is also careful. Lawrence has no experience in American football. How can he make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have the right skills. It's about how hard I work,"" he replies. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he is selected? ""I am. There's no pressure on me. Many people think I'll be picked, but I'm not worried."" This calm attitude might come from his Olympic experience, where he finished last in the discus final. He seems to have moved on and is happy he made it to the final with a great last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he says. ""The final didn't go as I wanted, but that's part of sport. I can always go back to it."" After the Olympics, some thought the big event affected him. Lawrence doesn't comment on this. An NFL player's minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so the money is a big reason to try. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his talent, wouldn't it be better to focus on one sport? ""I understand why someone would say that,"" he answers. ""I'm trying to do something I've dreamed about since I was a kid. If it doesn't work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I've made has been thought through."""
99,B2,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green made me feel better because, even though it was mid-September, it had not started snowing in Siberia yet. I saw no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to a remote area to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as bad as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I told him I believed there was a road, though not many people used it now. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and said one word, ""Holodna"" (cold), pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, but I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman's over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students sitting tiredly in their seats. Some were taking notes without much energy. The lecturer kept talking. I was thinking hard about a question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and fulfilling. Plus, there were long holidays to go on adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had become very adventurous after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since that first ride, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest challenge so far. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would be too much for him. Even though it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, finding that he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the people who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,B2,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through tall pylons, which are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to take part in this race. 
An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form said I was in good health, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I needed to stay aware of my surroundings. I was told, ""The horizon is your best friend,"" and the pilot would tell me where to look. I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.
Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. When we were moving down the runway, I tried not to touch the important steering pedals with my feet or the switches with my hands. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight, even though I was told to. In high-speed acrobatic flying, you need to stay calm and focused. You have to tense up and relax at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea.
As we started down the runway, Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. It was a quick and strong move, and I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach high in the air and my lungs feeling tight. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, flying between two pylons at 400 km per hour. My excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even started the acrobatics yet.
For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand was shaking so much that the plane shook too because it was very responsive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle in the air. Some people might find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters, but I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, when we were upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields.
The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience during a race. To show this, Dario started eating sandwiches as soon as we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed about doing loops over and over again."
101,B2,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have ever seen amazing videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, he probably filmed them. He likes it best when the temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I started at a good time. When I began, not many people had been to the Antarctic. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed.’ The camera and communication technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you filmed something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can film a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You filmed less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a world of polar bears and is very dangerous. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very hard. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,B2,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim in very cold water and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new and even more challenging expedition. Explorers are confident and determined people, and Pen is no different. This time, there is a lot more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole. They will take detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tough by sending him out into the cold Scottish mountains with very few clothes. His father loved adventures in the cold, and Pen found he had great physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he is at home because he is often thinking about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horses compete against runners. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. Pen says it is harder to leave them this time. When he last went, his children were one and five years old. He made a mistake by telling his son, ""You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister."" His son took it very seriously, which was too much pressure. So, Pen plans to have little contact with them while in the Arctic. ""If you call them, you remind them how far away you are,"" he says. Before leaving, he is carefully preparing his equipment. ""On the ice, you can't fix things easily,"" he explains. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer, will join him. They will have a team of six people flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for Pen, and he is also worried about his age. ""I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I haven’t trained as much as I’d like,"" he says. Why? ""Organizing things always seems more urgent. So I’m almost afraid of what I’ll ask of myself."" Pen believes his mission is important for learning about the Arctic. ""Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,"" he admits, ""and not very useful to others. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re trying to involve as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,"" he says. ""Our skills, which seemed strange and not useful before, are now very important. Suddenly, we’re useful to society again."""
103,B2,"I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, work on TV, and speak to businesses and schools. These activities were great, but I missed having something competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay fit in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle’s invitation: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I have always loved rowing and missed the feeling of the boat moving through the water. But I wasn’t ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but no one was interested. I knew if I entered, I would want to win, even though it was more of an adventure. Would rowing with Ben help me win? Probably not. But being the underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat deposit, making the race a real possibility. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would still take work to get everything ready. Besides the race costs, I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete. It’s nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I’d have something new to talk about: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but looking back, it was simple. I trained almost every day, but the program was set, and there were doctors and dieticians. I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I was concerned it would look like I just wanted to be on TV, instead of choosing a better partner to win. But during our preparations, my worries went away. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and lived on a deserted island for a year. But he couldn’t row. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest with Ben about the improvements he needed. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,B2,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of the Arctic's cold and empty landscapes, maybe because of the noise and crowds in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to let me work as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm’. It was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They said I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away.
November 6, London On my flight, I try to memorize the names of over 100 huskies, but I feel distracted and nervous. I stop and look out the window instead. People say spring moves north at about 26 km per day, with flowers and leaves opening. But I feel like I see winter moving south, with rivers freezing.
November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus ride north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrive at the farm after dark and am quickly given boots and sent outside. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which gets louder as I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, getting the huskies ready and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are very excited, pulling hard on the ropes. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and we start moving into the dark, with only a head torch for light.
November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I am asked what I can do for the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I don’t know. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never used an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become hard in freezing conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is full of instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I feel proud. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,B2,"On that day, when Radcliffe ran past the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would allow her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious and asked her about emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended it to help heal Radcliffe's injuries from an accident when she ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe says she never really realized how big her achievement was. Looking back, she knows it was a big deal, but at the time, it just felt like what she was supposed to do. She and her team had decided not to set any limits. Their motto was: no limits.
During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep up the fast pace. He thought she might have to stop the race. Hartmann was angry about this, but he understood that people who didn't know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast.
With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to think. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast but still managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would come close to that time soon. Radcliffe thought, ""I'm going to come back and do it next year."" Sadly, that didn't happen.
After the race, people wanted to know how Radcliffe, who ran with an awkward style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks, giving her daily sessions to help with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle that level of pain. She would make me work so hard that I had to ice my thumbs afterward.""
Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no ""Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?"" He barely got in the door before starting a two-hour session. Paula pushed him to give his best, which made her so good. During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became upset.
Can Radcliffe explain why no one has beaten her record? ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought it might happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves."" What does she mean? ""That mental way of never slowing down, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me to it because I never thought, 'I can relax now.' It was always: 'keep pushing as hard as you can.'""
Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the best of her career. She would never run as fast again. However, she left a lasting legacy. Many women were inspired to start long-distance running."
106,B2,"When my first cooking show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" came out, I didn't know how people would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I believed our show was a new and exciting part of that change. But I was worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques, but also history, memories, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether it's about the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often a real one, with travel and meeting new people. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest book, where you travel around the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best golden pasta. These people have spent years trying to reach their own idea of perfection. Perfection is different for everyone. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish wasn't included. But after long meetings, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of what perfection is, based on their feelings, memories, and surroundings. I knew from the start that I wouldn't say the recipes were the 'best.' But I thought that by using my skills and talking to food experts, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV series let me explore new foods, people, and places, which was very exciting. Finding the best ingredients took me all over the world. Some of my adventures included visiting a factory that had the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that wasn't good enough to film. I also tried new techniques, like hand-milking a cow to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down trying to make a perfect pizza."
107,B2,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field, stopping suddenly. John got out and looked at the engine, pretending to know what he was doing. After a while, he admitted, ""I actually have no idea what I'm doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried and said, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was big, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was safer to be on her side. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. John went to find someone who knew about cars, and Mum lay on the grass. ""Tell us a story,"" she said. Bea lay down next to her, and I told them about hearing two birds talking in London. They talked about breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. They even argued about a worm. Bea said, ""That's silly, no one understands bird language."" I insisted I did, but I wasn't sure anymore. Mum had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped push the van to a hotel. Bea didn't want to get out, but the boys smiled and waved at her. We went into a café near the road. ""It's a hotel,"" John whispered. ""It might be expensive."" Mum said, ""We'll just have some tea,"" and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum said, ""It's like syrup."" We stayed there all day while John tried to fix the van. ""It's a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum made a bed for us outside in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn't moving. John said, ""I'll have to get us towed into Marrakech."" Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John driving it. Bea didn't want to move, so John carried her to the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we would get home since our van needed to be towed. I thought maybe we could take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,B2,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like Lucy. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city. Lucy didn't hear the girl's name clearly because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. Both of them were about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well. They talked about the music they were playing and their travel plans. 
Lucy mentioned she might go to the Tanglewood festival in the summer. It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She often did things like concerts and competitions that took her around the world. Because of this, she missed a lot of school and wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. Lucy hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. Her mom had applied for her without telling her. Lucy's dad bought her a necklace to celebrate, and her little brother Gus dreamed of going to the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for dinner to plan her music pieces. Lucy thought her mom didn't want to give her the chance to say no to the festival.
The guy from Tokyo asked Lucy about Tanglewood. She told him she was fifteen. He and the girl, Liesel or Louisa, seemed impressed. Lucy didn't mean to show off. It was hard to know when she was just sharing information or bragging. Liesel or Louisa left to talk to someone else, but the guy from Tokyo stayed. He asked if Lucy had been to Japan. She said she went once when she was eight. 
Then, Lucy's grandfather came and took her away to introduce her to other people. He told her not to get too friendly with the competition. Lucy said they weren't the competition, but her grandfather thought everyone was. He made her talk to important people at the party. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she didn't hear everything they said. 
After the party, in the elevator, her grandfather told her she did well and that he was proud of her. He said the festival was important and that people were talking about her. Lucy liked being someone important, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care about her music skills. But at the festival, Lucy felt like she mattered."
109,B2,"""It's not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,"" said Dad. It's hard to argue with him, so I decided to see what experts say about it. It's quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of who they are, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a big part of modern childhood. Teenagers don't just use media for things like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do; they live in it. It's not good or bad – it depends on how you use it.
How does our social networking compare to what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it's like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, which today's parents did when they were younger. It helps teenagers develop their identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and get along with friends.
Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says adolescence is a time when you ask, ""Who am I?"" Social networking can help you find your identity. You can share your favorite music or sports, discover what you like, and see that other people have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don't use social media. He says social media can help if you're shy: communicating online can be easier than face-to-face, and it can help you practice social skills in a less scary way.
Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help if you're quiet and have a special interest because they let you connect with others who like the same things. If only a few people in your school like a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group with similar interests, you can feel popular in a different way.
Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people, and create their own content are really using social networks well. She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity. Keen photographers can connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interest. This can help with jobs and will be useful in the workplace. Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness, so you need to understand how it works. For example, if you create a product and have 1000 friends on social networks, they could be your customers. If you connect all those networks, there's your customer base.
Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working, agrees Matthews. One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create and share content. Collaboration is an important skill for the 21st century and helps you be employable in a digital age."""
110,B2,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they probably don't imagine a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. But my parents wanted something different for our summer vacation this year. My dad planned what many teenagers would call a nightmare: a big family road trip. He and my mom kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There's probably a good reason why!""
In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. We barely had room left in the car when we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" Leaving our big house for smaller places to stay over the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into.
We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest, starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way!
The next day, we were up early and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to feel the same, but each adventure was unique. We walked on the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly town gave us a hint of what was to come later in our trip. As we climbed to our next stop, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we went, we saw a mix of old and new things. We got used to dealing with construction traffic. We laughed when we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument.
We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common. Our own close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger gave us unforgettable memories. As we traveled, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with no internet or cell phone service, didn't bother us. It was a 95-year-old building, but the views were amazing.
After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to a faraway place to find something special. It was both happy and sad to be home again, but at least I didn't fight with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our crazy journey to look through. I knew I would remember the unplanned and spontaneous moments the most."
111,B2,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, was going with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy was finishing her last year of school and would live at the college under the care of the Head. She was happy because she got the best room with a kitchen and study area, and she could use the Internet and phone freely. Jeff and Dahlia would still check on Amy.
Rose was moving to her grandmother's house. She only remembered her grandmother from holidays and never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose's parents were not very excited, but Daisy insisted. Rose didn't know why her parents didn't get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Rose was ten years old the last time she saw her grandmother, but she had happy memories. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting because Daisy was very social and liked to bring people together. Rose expected to get dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon. This made Rose smile because her grandmother was very active and attended many social events.
Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was mature and knew about healthy living. She wanted independence, like playing music loudly, inviting friends over, or going out without asking for permission. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood this. Rose's mother gave her a new phone with a video camera for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to make good decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were problems, they would talk about it.
Rose was not a troublemaker. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start a new school, make new friends, and start fresh. It was her fourth school in five years, so she was used to it. She knew this would be the last time because she was starting her final two years of school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed difficult, and she didn't know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Amazingly, the novel she started then is about to be published. She recently told her old teacher, who was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't understand why she should wait if she had a chance to be good at it.
It's a winter afternoon at Charlotte's publisher's office. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a big achievement: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of its main character, shows it was written by a teenager. A public relations person is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn't need any support. She is confident, smart, and steady, which stops her from being too confident.
Charlotte knows she is young. I ask her about the complex moral issues in her book. She says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don't have many life lessons to share,"" she laughs. ""I don't think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I'm not particularly wise. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.""
She has a theory about how teenagers are shown in books. She says there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the world, and the awkward teenager who isn't socially skilled. Reading about these types annoyed her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who aren't inadequate in some way. Some writers unintentionally make teenagers feel they can't know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.""
Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I could do it."" However, she praises a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It says if the reader can guess what will happen, the suspense is probably gone.""
Some might think Charlotte's parents, who are both journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father's connection with someone in publishing got her book read initially. She knows she was lucky because getting a first novel read is hard, no matter the author's age. ""Every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,B2,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, wanted to show he knew what he was doing. He went first, skiing down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew into the air, but something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I liked practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it, and I was afraid of being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students jumped and tried new tricks, landing in foam cubes. It wasn’t a real introduction to what we’d face on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down again. Land in the right zone, and you keep moving forward. Land on the flat, and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs would almost stop as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment I felt proud. But that didn’t last. On the last run of the day, I didn’t slow down as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed in the right zone. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,B2,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold tightly to the safety bar. The ride stops for a moment, and you take a deep breath as the rollercoaster slowly climbs up. There is a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You move quickly forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Everything is a blur, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose to be there, just like millions of people who visit theme parks every year.
Amusement parks are a big business because people love the exciting rides. To create these thrilling experiences, many skilled people work behind the scenes. There are engineers, designers, and marketing experts who make sure the rides are fun and safe. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it is a real and challenging career. Designers must create rides that are both exciting and safe, and they need to come up with new ideas to keep visitors interested.
Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most of the techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rides were more extreme, but now designers have to work with the track designs made by specialist companies.
I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, an engineering expert, explained that the key is to make people feel like they are being thrown around but still safe. It's important to find the right balance between excitement and comfort.
To create a great ride, designers need to tell a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and use new ideas like the tallest ride or the most twists. Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trying different things are what work best. Jeff Hornick, a theme park development director, agreed that designers need to understand what passengers want and test the rides themselves.
I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoaster design. Walker said that while new technology can add to the experience, the physical rollercoaster will still be the main attraction for many years."
115,B2,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer. She has created dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both with her busy schedule. She says, ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio and take orders from strict choreographers. It can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day.’ As a choreographer, she teaches and likes working with young students. ‘New dancers are open to trying new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want to succeed but don’t fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This means they accept even tough criticism. They might still question me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’
When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There might be music I don’t like, but I still try to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose new music. I’d like to be more experimental and switch music when rehearsals are tough. But now, I work on big productions where the music is already decided by the composer and can’t be changed.’
Miranda doesn’t want to work with just one institution. ‘I think it’s important to meet new people. But I have to remember that each theatre and school has different methods and styles. So, I have to change how I work each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing. This helps me not to become too set in my ways.’
We talk about a recent documentary on ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘Some documentaries look glamorous but are misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one tries to show what life is really like in a dance company. There’s a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I recognized that. She knows she’s not doing it right but can’t make her body do it. It’s hard to watch but not fake. People don’t realize how much work and dedication ballet takes.’
I ask what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to ask, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences. It can help cover a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. That’s disappointing.’
Miranda has done many different things, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s a trend to focus on one area, but I don’t follow that. Maybe one day I’ll be known for one thing, but for now, I want to explore more.’"
