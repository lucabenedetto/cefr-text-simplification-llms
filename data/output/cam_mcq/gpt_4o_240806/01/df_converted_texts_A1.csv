1,"A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone online where you are. The website said that when you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also telling everyone, even people you don't know, that you are not at home. This made people think about the problems of sharing too much online. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. This can be exciting because it might bring us money or fame. So, we share our secrets, photos, and stories online. But later, we might find out that this is not safe, and we can get lost in it. 

In the early days of the internet, some people tried sharing their lives online. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with being famous before social media existed. These people were the first bloggers. They learned lessons that we can learn from today. 

In 1994, a student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. He wrote about everything and posted photos and art. In 1996, he started a daily blog. Many people read it because he shared so much. But one day, he stopped because he fell in love, and his partner said, ""It's me or the blog."" He learned that sharing too much online can make people not trust you.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong had a blog where she sometimes wrote about her job. Someone at her work shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. But Heather's story ended well. She got married, started blogging again about her family, and now her blog helps support her family. She learned to be careful about what she shares online.

The internet lets us say anything, but that doesn't mean we should say everything."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started talking about a movie called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This movie mixes real facts and stories to show that there is a lot about our universe we do not understand. Scientists usually agree with this idea because no one knows everything about the universe. However, some scientists were worried about the movie and said it was bad or even dangerous. 

At first, the movie seemed normal. Scientists talked about how new things we learn make the universe seem stranger than we thought. But then, the movie talked about strange ideas, like water changing because of people's thoughts. A Japanese researcher said that happy thoughts could make water look nice, and bad thoughts could make it look ugly. The movie showed pictures of ice crystals to prove this. Some people found this interesting, but many scientists did not believe it. They wanted better proof.

The movie's ideas were not strange enough. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is growing because of something called ""dark energy."" This is real and comes from many years of research. Scientists also found that our brains take a little time to understand what we see, and they have learned where modern humans came from. Some scientists think there is a link between life on Earth and the universe's design.

Science is not finished. We still have a lot to learn. Some things in nature might never be fully understood. Scientists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. Many people think the universe is amazing."
3,"I like writing novels and short stories. Writing novels is hard, like planting a forest. Writing short stories is fun, like planting a garden. Both are important to me. Trees in the forest give shade, and flowers in the garden bring bees and butterflies. I write novels and short stories at different times. When I finish a novel, I write short stories. When I finish short stories, I write a novel. I started writing short stories in 1984. It was hard at first, but I enjoyed it. My first short story was 'Breaking Waves'. Short stories are quick to write, usually about a week. Novels take a long time, maybe a year or two. Short stories can come from small ideas, like a word or picture. If a short story is not good, it's okay. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver did not always write perfect stories. I learn from my short stories to help me write better novels. Short stories are like small memories for me. They show my feelings, and I like sharing them with readers."
4,"Science is a way to understand the world. It helps us in many ways, like curing diseases. Science can be hard to understand, and sometimes people do not agree about it. Scientists often change their ideas when they learn new things. This book talks about big ideas in science that changed how we think. 

Science is always changing. One scientist might say something, and another might prove it wrong. Sometimes, these changes are small, but sometimes they are big and change what we believe. For example, a long time ago, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Later, scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein found new ideas that changed this view.

Science has given us many new things, like X-rays and the idea of the Big Bang. Some people think we might soon understand everything about the universe, but we are not sure yet. Science is important because it helps us control nature, but we must be careful. We need to understand science because it affects our lives and the future of our planet."
5,"Around 2015, big book companies noticed that ebook sales stopped growing or even went down. This made people wonder if ebooks would be important in the future. Some people thought ebooks were a big deal and spent too much money on them. But, both ebooks and print books can exist together. People still ask if ebooks will replace print books. This idea makes us think and talk a lot. 

Why do we think ebooks and print books are fighting? This is because we feel excited and scared about new things. In the past, people thought new technology would replace old ones. For example, when TV came, people thought radio would disappear, but it didnâ€™t. Radio found new ways to be useful, like in cars. 

The idea of books disappearing is not new. In 1894, people thought phonographs would replace books with audiobooks. Many times, people thought new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end print books. Some people worried this would be bad for culture, while others thought ebooks were great. 

When new technology comes, we feel mixed emotions. We love and fear change because we have strong feelings for things like books and TVs. We even name our cars or get mad at our computers. New technology makes us change how we feel about these things. 

As technology changes, we miss what we used to have. This is why people like old things. For example, when printing started in the 15th century, people wanted old handwritten books. When movies got sound, people missed silent films. The same happened with photos and music records. 

E-readers made people like old books more, even their smell. This shows print books might not disappear. But the idea of things disappearing helps us understand change. We use stories about endings to make sense of new things. These stories show our excitement for the future and our fear of losing what we know."
6,"For a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how famous people from the past 400 years did their best work. I wanted to know how they found time each day to be creative and productive. I looked at their daily lives, like when they slept, ate, and worked. I wanted to show how their habits made them who they were.

The book I wrote is called ""Daily Rituals."" It talks about people's routines. Routines are the things we do every day without thinking much. A good routine can help us use our time and energy better. The psychologist William James said that having good habits can help us focus on important things. But he himself found it hard to stick to a schedule.

I got the idea for this book one Sunday afternoon. I was at work, trying to write a story, but I kept getting distracted. I started looking online for how other writers worked. I found many interesting stories and thought someone should collect them. So, I started a blog called ""Daily Routines"" and later wrote this book.

In the book, I share many people's routines. I used quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. I also used information from biographies and articles. I thank all the writers and researchers whose work helped me. You can find all my sources in the Notes section of the book."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His family could not go on holiday to Spain because it was too expensive. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found a fossil called an ammonite on the beach. This made him want to study fossils. 

At university, Howard decided he wanted to study very old fossils, not dinosaurs. He liked studying small, ancient creatures in rocks. After finishing his studies, he worried about finding a job. He knew he was good, but getting a job was not easy.

Howard applied for a job at Tavistock College in London. On the day of his interview, the professor who liked another candidate could not come. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, helped Howard get the job. Howard was happy to get the job, even though he knew it was not because he was the best.

Howard liked his job because he could plan his work. But sometimes, unexpected things happened. One day, someone stole his briefcase with important notes. He was upset but went for coffee with a colleague. There, he met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. The visitor told him about a new collection of fossils. Howard decided to study these fossils. He changed his plans and decided to go to Nairobi instead of other trips. This new project was very important for his career."
8,"Charles Spence will eat almost anything. He is a Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. At home, he has ice cream made from bee larvae. It looks like maggots but tastes a bit nutty and floral. Spence and his team study how we taste food. They want to make eating bugs normal. They also study how our senses work together to change how we taste food. Spence helps big food companies and famous restaurants with his research. He studies things like who we eat with, how food looks, and even the noise around us. All these things can change how food tastes.

Spence wrote a book called ""The Perfect Meal"" with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman. It has many interesting facts about eating. For example, the first person to order food in a group enjoys their meal the most. Also, we eat more when we are with other people. Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and not high-tech. He works with cooks who cannot pay for research. A big food company gives him money for his work. In the past, people thought this kind of research was not real science. But now, it is important because it shows how research can help people.

Spence helps food companies reduce salt and sugar in their products. They do it slowly so people do not notice the change. If people know about the change, they might not like the taste. Spence met Heston Blumenthal, a famous chef, while working on a project. Together, they created a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"" that uses sound to change how food tastes. Spence found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and low-pitched music makes it taste bitter. An airline will soon use music to match the food they serve. A brand also made an app that plays music while ice cream softens.

At home, Spence has fun dinner parties. Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colored lights and sounds with drinks. For Spence, home and work are the same. He loves to explore how we taste food everywhere."
9,"Our brains are very busy today. We get a lot of information, some true and some not. We have to decide what is important and what is not. We also do more things by ourselves now. In the past, travel agents helped us book flights, and salespeople helped us in shops. Now, we do these things on our own. We try to do many things at once, like work, family, hobbies, and watching TV. Our smartphones help us do this. But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at the same time, but we cannot. Earl Miller, a brain expert, says our brains are not good at doing many things at once. We just switch quickly from one thing to another, and this is not good for us. It makes us less efficient. Doing many things at once can make us stressed and confused. Our brains like new things, so we get distracted easily. Just having the chance to do many things at once can make us less smart. Glenn Wilson, a psychology expert, says trying to focus when you have an unread email can make you less smart. Russ Poldrack, another brain expert, found that learning while doing other things makes the information go to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV, the schoolwork goes to a part of the brain for skills, not facts. Without TV, it goes to a part of the brain that helps us remember better. Making decisions is also hard for our brains. Even small decisions can make us tired and lead to bad choices. Many people say email is a big problem because there is too much of it. A friend's son said his dad just answers emails all day, and his dad agreed. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and do other things too."
10,"In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think these questions were important. Scientists studied animal actions and results, but not their feelings. But now, things are changing. Scientists are starting to study animal emotions. Books like ""Wild Justice"" and ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"" talk about this. There is a big question: do animals have feelings like humans? Another question is about right and wrong. In one study, cows opened a gate to get food. Cows that opened the gate themselves were happier than those that got help. If cows like solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? Some people, like Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, think we should stop eating meat. He says this is a big change, like when slavery ended. Professor Aubrey Manning thinks we should think again about how smart animals are. He says animals have a simpler mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail says we should not think animals are like humans. The main issue is not just science or morals, but philosophy. Can we know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an experiment with birds called starlings. Some starlings lived in nice cages, others in bad ones. When given bad food, only the birds in nice cages ate it. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt sad. He believes we will one day see animal rights like we see human rights. Professor Manning agrees with Balcombe. He says ideas about animals change over time. It is a difficult topic, and people have strong opinions."
11,"Text: Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear better. Adrian West, a researcher, says that people think arguing helps find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might change how we solve problems. We see a lot of bad thinking and opinions, which can confuse us. More data does not always mean more knowledge. Reading books has gone down, and this might hurt critical thinking. People focus more on quick media and doing many things at once. We don't know exactly how technology affects thinking. Computers and the internet can be good or bad for thinking. Some games help with thinking, but too many links on the internet can stop deep thought. Reading helps imagination and thinking more than video games and TV. Visual media can help with some information, but they don't give time to think deeply. Many young people don't use their full abilities. How we see technology affects how we think about critical thinking. Video games can be good for learning, says James Paul Gee. Games like Sim City teach decision-making and thinking skills. In the digital age, we need to understand how technology affects thinking."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He wrote a book about how working with your hands is good. His new book talks about how to live in the modern world. He got the idea when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. He thinks these ads make it hard for us to focus on what we want to think about. 

Crawford says we are losing the ability to think and remember because we are always interrupted. We don't talk to strangers anymore because we want to avoid these interruptions. We see the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can control us. 

Many people are worried about this. For example, some people complain about emails but still check them all the time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us. We are more aware of other things we could be doing. 

Crawford believes technology makes us focus too much on ourselves. We prefer texting to talking because it feels safer. This can make us lose real connections with people. 

He gives an example from his gym. Before, there was one music player for everyone, which sometimes caused problems. Now, people listen to their own music with earphones, so the gym is less social. 

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, we should do activities that make us focus on real things, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us connect with the world and other people. 

By focusing on one thing, we can learn to pay better attention to everything else."
13,"Text: ""What do you do for work?"" is a common question. We often talk about our jobs. But for me, as a philosopher, it's a bit tricky. Saying ""I am a philosopher"" can sound like I think I know more than others, which is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else. 

People think philosophers are special because they talk about life and thinking. A long time ago, a Greek philosopher named Aristotle said thinking about life is the best way to live. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said we should think about our lives to make them better. 

Thinking about life doesn't mean you have to read a lot of books. It means looking at your life and making sure it is good. You don't have to be away from people to do this. It's about sharing ideas and making life better for everyone.

Today, philosophy can seem far from real life. Many philosophers write for other experts, not for everyone. This makes it hard for people to understand what philosophers do. 

I work in ethics, which is about deciding if actions are right or wrong. But philosophy is more than just this. It helps us think about our actions and beliefs. By doing this, we can learn and improve our lives."
14,"Text: People who love food, like chefs and food lovers, think a lot about what we eat and how we eat. In the past, philosophers talked about food to explain other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, they talked about food, but it was really about other things. 

Epicurus, a Greek philosopher, talked about enjoying life and avoiding pain. People now think of him when they think about enjoying food and drink. His name is used in restaurants and food shops because it makes people think the food is special.

Food is important in our culture and society. It comes from history and is shared with others. We eat with friends and family, and food is grown and shared in our communities. We talk about food a lot because it is a big part of our lives.

Some people write about food and taste. They are not special experts; they are just good at describing food. Most studies about how we see and taste focus on vision, not taste, and this should change.

Food can be beautiful, like art or music. But when we eat food, it is gone, unlike when we look at a painting or listen to music. Some people think food should be part of art discussions, but others say it cannot be because it does not last.

There are also questions about what we should eat, like organic or vegetarian food. These choices show what we believe is right or wrong. Philosophers ask why we make these choices.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. At home, we cook for family and friends, and everyone is welcome. In restaurants, chefs cook for their job, and only trained people work in the kitchen.

Food can help people from different cultures understand each other. We can learn about other cultures by eating their food and making friends while eating together. This has been important in international meetings for a long time. A recent essay talks about how food helps people connect, with many fun stories to explain this idea."
15,"Rob Daviau is from the US and makes special board games called 'legacy' games. He thought old board games were not fun or hard enough. So, he wanted to change them. He made a new version of a game called Risk. In this new game, what you do in one game can change the next game. You might have to tear up cards or change the board. The game has a story that goes on for many sessions. 

Rob also helped make a legacy version of another game called Pandemic. In this game, players work together to stop diseases. His next game was SeaFall, where players explore new lands. Making these games is hard because designers have to think about all the choices players might make. They test the games a lot to make sure they work well.

At first, Rob thought only a few people would like legacy games. But many people loved them. They think these games are exciting and new. One fan, Ben, said itâ€™s like watching a new movie every time. Legacy games are like TV shows with episodes. Rob wanted to tell stories with games, like writing a book. He is happy to see others try new things with his idea. Some people think legacy games change how we think about board games."
16,"Text: 'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealandâ€™s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online. People like stories about animals escaping, like rats and llamas, because it makes us think animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart, even though they look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor. Some people think it is not scientific to say animals are like humans. But Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas, says it is wrong to ignore the human-like traits of animals. He calls this ""anthropodenial."" He says animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others. In the past, people thought animals were smart. In medieval times, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, who created the theory of evolution, said the difference between humans and animals is not big. In the 20th century, people started to see animals as machines that only respond to rewards and punishments. But now, Dr. de Waal believes we are starting to see animals as smart again. He says we are learning more about animal intelligence. The best tests for animal intelligence consider what each animal is good at. For example, squirrels can remember where they hide nuts, even if they are not good at human memory tasks. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, Sy Montgomery says if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we are not smart because we cannot change the color of our skin. Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean, but he knows stories like this help people appreciate animal intelligence. He did an experiment with monkeys to see if they feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers got upset. A video of this experiment convinced many people that animals can feel emotions like envy.'"
17,"Robots were once only in science fiction stories, but now they are becoming very important. Robots have been used in car factories for a long time. Now, experts say robots will soon be used in many more places. Many people think robots will do most jobs in the next 50 years, but they also think their own jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Robots will change every job. 

For example, an Australian company made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This is much faster than two people can do in a day. Another company in San Francisco made a robot called Tally. Tally moves around supermarkets to check if items are on the shelves and priced correctly.

Some people say robots will create new jobs for people who can fix and program them. But others worry that robots will take away jobs that need people skills. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, says robots will work with people and other robots soon. In a few years, many big companies will have a special person in charge of robots. 

In five years, people working with robots will earn more money, but there will not be enough skilled workers for all the jobs. Dr. Zhang says people need to learn new skills because they cannot do the same job forever. New robots will also be made for homes and will be very smart. 

This change is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. Many jobs might be lost, so education is important. Countries need more people studying science, technology, engineering, and maths to stay strong in the future."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous climber, was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He said, ""Because it's there."" People often wonder why anyone would do something so dangerous. Some think climbing is about adventure and fun. 

In 1967, a writer named Tejada-Flores talked about different types of climbing. He said there are seven kinds of climbing, each with its own rules. For example, some climbs use a lot of equipment, and some use very little. This idea is popular among climbers today.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom when they climb. But sometimes, climbing can feel limiting, like when a storm keeps you stuck in a tent. This is a bit of a puzzle, but some say the simple life of a climber is a kind of freedom.

Joe Fitschen, a US climber, thinks we should ask, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is in our nature. We like to take on challenges, even if they are risky.

Brian Treanor, a US academic, says climbing can teach us important things like courage and respect for nature. He thinks these are important in today's world.

Some climbers believe that climbing without help from others or technology is better. Ebert and Robinson, two expert climbers, think these climbs deserve more respect. But this idea can be dangerous because it might make people take unnecessary risks.

Climbing is also about being in the moment and solving problems. Some people say climbing is like Zen philosophy, which helps train the mind to find peace. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,"Alfred Brendel was a famous pianist for over 60 years. He played and recorded many important piano pieces. He did not teach much. People who knew him well saw he could be fun, but he was serious in concerts. He worked hard, always studying, traveling, and playing music.

One day, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not want to teach him. He thought, ""You don't need a mountain guide to teach a child to walk."" But Kit, who was 14, played very well. Brendel listened to him and thought, ""I have to make time for him."" Kit played beautifully and had a special way of understanding music.

Now, Kit is 19 and learning many things. He studies languages, math, and plays tennis. He also writes music. Brendel says it is important to write music to understand it better. Kit has a great memory and listens well. He can do what Brendel teaches him.

Brendel is careful not to say Kit will be a great pianist too soon. He thinks it is not good to expect too much too early. Brendel is now 80 years old and does not play in public anymore. He is happy with what he has done in his life and still thinks about music."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were beautiful places. My grandad's garden was not in a dirty city. It was next to a river and went down to the water. You couldn't touch the river, but you could hear the water and birds. I thought all gardens were like this â€“ quiet and peaceful. Grandad's garden was simple. He didn't have a greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows with plastic patches.

At home, my dad was often quiet. He liked funny things and had favorite phrases like ""It's immaterial to me,"" which means ""I don't mind."" He left school without finishing and became a plumber. He didn't love plumbing; it was just his job. He and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but they didn't. He was good at fixing things at home, like making bookshelves.

My parents moved house only once. My mom liked to change furniture. One day, we got a piano. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mom took them away. My sister got piano lessons, not me. When I asked why, my mom said, ""You'd never have practiced.""

I liked the river best. I would go there with a fishing net and old sandals. I looked for fish to catch and take home. After trying to keep them alive, I put them back in the river.

I wanted to leave school early, but it seemed hard. One day, my dad said, ""There's a job for an apprentice gardener. You might like it."" He thought I should be a carpenter, but he saw I loved gardening. I think he hoped it would be good for me."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his island, the Isle of Muck, in Scotland. The wind is very strong, but Lawrence is not worried. He is with his sheepdog, Tie. Lawrence is showing me the islands around us. He points and says, ""That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It rains a lot there."" I see the rain on Rum's mountains. ""Beyond Rum is the island of Soay,"" he says.

Lawrence has to move his sheep, so we walk down the hill. He tells me about the island. Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide. The geese eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. While moving the sheep, Tie, the dog, is not doing well. Lawrence tells Tie to go right, but Tie goes straight. Lawrence is not happy with Tie.

The Isle of Muck is run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son, Colin, takes care of the cottages. Their daughter, Mary, and her husband, Toby, run the island hotel. Mary and Toby like that their children can play outside safely.

Life on the island is different. Electricity is not always on. My first night, I wait for the lights. In the morning, Mary makes breakfast with a torch. There is no mobile phone service, but you can get it on a hill. Most people stop using their phones after a few days.

The boat brings groceries and three musicians to the island. They play music in the tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on the Isle of Soay without seeing it. Jenny went to manage it, even though she only had typing skills.

It rains a lot, but the food is good. Mary sends me to get fresh fish from Sandy Mathers. We eat the fish for dinner, and it is very tasty. The next morning, I need to take a ferry to another island. Many ferries were canceled before because of bad weather. If my ferry does not come, I will stay on Muck for two more days, which I secretly hope for."
22,"Text: 'The video game industry used to be small and mostly for young people. Now, it is very important and growing. Making video games is hard work. It needs many people and a lot of time. Jim Donelly, who works for a games magazine, says it is hard to get a job in big companies. But the industry needs more game designers. Not just the big bosses, but also people who make small parts of games. To get into the industry, you should make your own games. You need to show what you can do. John Field, another expert, says it is not easy. Many people want to work in games, but not everyone has the skills. A good course in games can help. Most game designers start as programmers or artists. They like all kinds of entertainment and art. They are not just fans; they want to make games better. Knowing people in the industry can also help you get a job. Video games are not just for kids anymore. Families play together, and there are many games on phones and social media. John thinks there are many chances to grow in this industry. Games are fun and can help people learn new things.'"
23,"Text: 'Since I was a child, I always wanted to play football. My dad liked football too and he helped me play. He didn't force me, and I am happy about that. I had a friend who came to the park with us. His dad was very strict and always said, â€˜You canâ€™t do this, you canâ€™t do that.â€™ My friend stopped playing football because of this. I am glad my dad was not like that. When I score a great goal, people say it is luck, but it is not. I practiced a lot since I was a kid. The best players practice for many years. Sometimes young players bump into each other, but I learned good skills. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning. I played many sports at school like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know school is important, but I only thought about football then. The teachers were good, but I didnâ€™t notice. I donâ€™t want this for my son. We read him books, but he is too young to sit still. He likes to kick the books, like me. At the start of my football career, the manager helped young players like me. He didnâ€™t make a big deal about it. We knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game, but we lost. A TV presenter said, â€˜You canâ€™t win anything with kids.â€™ This made us work harder. I trust my friends and family a lot. Having a lot of money can be hard. People say, â€˜Why does your mother still work?â€™ I help my parents with money. I paid for their house and bought them a car. My family is strong and they like to work. My mum is a hairdresser and she loves her job. I like to help people around me with my money. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off. I want to go skiing, but I canâ€™t now. If I break my leg skiing, I canâ€™t play football and I wonâ€™t have insurance.'"
24,"Sam Carter helped us find a place to live at Reef Point. Sam was my dad's agent in Los Angeles. My dad couldn't write in Los Angeles, so Sam found us a cheap place to stay. Reef Point was quiet in the summer because of the sea fogs. People didn't visit much because the road was bad, and a nicer place, La Carmella, was nearby. Only people with no money or who loved surfing came to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, many people came. My dad was busy writing a script and didn't notice me much. I spent time on the beach with my dog, Rusty. Rusty wasn't our dog at first, but he stayed with us. I gave him water, and my dad didn't mind him much. Rusty liked to dig and bring me things, sometimes things that weren't his. I had to give those back to their owners. Rusty also liked to swim with me, even though I was faster. One day, after swimming, we watched surfers. One surfer was really good. She came over and talked to me. She asked why I didn't surf, and I said I didn't have a board or money. She found out my dad wrote a book called ""Tall as the Morning."" She was interested when she heard that. People were always more interested when they knew about my dad's book."
25,"Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on the ship called Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this advice was wrong. There was a problem with the computer system, and everyone had to wait. People were upset because they paid a lot for the trip and wanted it to be nice.

Violet wanted to leave, but she realized she lost her phone. This made her feel even worse about the trip. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left her phone there because all her numbers were in the phone. Her son Harry always told her to be careful about this. She asked a couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to look for her phone in her apartment.

Finally, the line started moving, and Violet gave her travel papers to get on the ship. She didn't like the ship's entrance because it looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, and carpets like those in airports. She took the elevator, which was crowded with tired people, to the twelfth floor. She was happy to find her room had a balcony, just like she wanted. She had paid a lot to make sure she could see the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was finding the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 pictures by Maier, a street photographer who took interesting photos. Maloof now has a big collection of Maierâ€™s work. In his home, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, plus many movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked at all of it and felt lucky. â€˜When I bought this, I didnâ€™t know what it was,â€™ Maloof said. â€˜I could have sold it all to someone else.â€™ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maierâ€™s life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and grew up in France. In 1951, she went back to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always had a camera. She wore big coats, hats, and strong shoes. â€˜On her day off, she had her camera and we didnâ€™t see her until late,â€™ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier. â€˜She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.â€™ Maier knew a lot about theatre and movies. She was not very social but liked to take pictures of people and sometimes recorded them talking. She loved her â€˜second jobâ€™ of taking pictures. â€˜She was a true artist and did what she wanted,â€™ said Rydzon. â€˜She didnâ€™t let anything stop her.â€™ Maierâ€™s work was pure art; she didnâ€™t do it for money. Her photos often showed women, children, old people, and the poor. â€˜Vivianâ€™s pictures are very interesting,â€™ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees other photographersâ€™ influence in her work and wonders if she made her own style. â€˜Was Vivian very skilled or did she copy others?â€™ Maloof wonders if he will see all the negatives, which he keeps in three big, safe cabinets. He was not interested in photography until he found Maierâ€™s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. â€˜As I learned more, I saw her work was about people and street scenes,â€™ he said. â€˜There was more to her work than I thought. Now, we want people to know her name. We want Vivian Maier in history books.â€™"
27,"Text: 'When a book is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her book to the officer. The officer asked, â€˜Whatâ€™s it about?â€™ This is not an easy question for a writer. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are many crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story is very complex. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a history book, but she found the past gave her more ideas for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it feels nice because people in her small country feel proud too. She said, â€˜What is annoying is when people think my book is not serious.â€™ She wanted to write the book like a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. The book gets faster as it goes. I asked if it matters if readers notice this. She said, â€˜I wanted to make a book with patterns that donâ€™t matter, but if you care, you can see them.â€™ Even with its special structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery. She didnâ€™t plan the book before writing. She liked to write herself into difficult situations and then find a way out. She also wanted the book to be fun for readers. We talked about her love for TV drama series. I asked if she wants to write for TV. She said, â€˜That could be pretty cool.â€™ She is very excited when talking about writing and New Zealand. She said, â€˜When I come to Britain, my imagination changes because it is a different place. I see why writers leave New Zealand to be around more people.â€™ But for now, New Zealand is her home. I hope it gives her ideas for more books.'"
28,"Jonny Kinkead loved making things and playing the guitar when he was a boy. For the last 40 years, he has been making guitars by hand. He says, ""I still love the guitar. It's amazing how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound. Different wood makes different sounds, and it still surprises me.""

Jonny learned to play the guitar at age 11. At 16, he wanted a bass guitar. Instead of buying one, he decided to make it himself. He studied guitars to understand how their shape and wood type changed the sound. Jonny and his brothers used to build model boats and planes, so he knew how to make things. His father taught them how to use tools. Jonny also fixed instruments for his friends.

Jonny's first bass guitar was good, but he didn't think about making guitars as a job. He liked painting and sculpture too. After school, he studied architecture at university because he liked design. But he left the course because he wanted to do something different. He realized making guitars is like sculpture because you shape the sound. He thought it was better than art because people use guitars.

Jonny started making guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows to earn money. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of the materials. As he became known as a good guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, he only makes about ten guitars a year, so he doesn't earn a lot. In the beginning, he went to music festivals to show his guitars to musicians. He learned how to price his guitars by talking to musicians.

Jonny thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers in the UK now. When he started, people thought only American guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are respected. Jonny says learning in a classroom is good, but trying things yourself is important too. He believes you learn a lot by looking at other instruments and trying different things. If you make mistakes, you learn from them. Jonny was self-taught, and he thinks this helped him learn everything."
29,"Text: When English people talk, they often start with the weather. This is a tradition. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This was true 200 years ago and is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they find it interesting. But this is not true. 

The American writer Bill Bryson says the English weather is not exciting. There are no big storms like tornadoes or monsoons. The English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman says the weather is interesting because it is always changing. You never know what the weather will be like.

But both Bryson and Paxman miss the point. English people talk about the weather to start a conversation. When someone says, ""Nice day, isnâ€™t it?"" or ""Ooh, isnâ€™t it cold?"" they are not really talking about the weather. They are just trying to start a conversation or fill a silence. 

Talking about the weather is like how monkeys groom each other to be friendly. English people use weather talk in three ways: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or to fill a pause when they don't know what else to say. This is why it seems like English people talk about the weather a lot."
30,"Alice Leader was in front of Hadrianâ€™s Wall in Britain. She was telling her class of 12- and 13-year-olds about how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip over trips to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built, but Alice felt her answers were not good enough. She could not find a good book about life at the Wall in Roman times, so she decided to write one herself. 

Alice stopped teaching after 31 years and started writing books in 2001. She said teaching was like acting and very tiring, but writing was exciting and less tiring. Her old teaching friends were jealous because she still worked with children through her books. Alice wants her books to be different from other childrenâ€™s books. She thinks many books for teenagers are about bad experiences or are total fantasy like Harry Potter. Her books are different.

Alice liked to teach English and History together. She loved seeing children go from bored to interested and from not understanding to understanding. She started writing because her two sons were leaving home, and her head teacher suggested a writing course. At first, she didnâ€™t want to do it, but she had to send a story to join the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. The course students liked her story and said she should publish it.

Alice asked for a year off from teaching to write her first book. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helped her edit the book. He read her chapters and helped make them better. Aliceâ€™s mother-in-law thinks they are competing, but Alice thinks they work well together."
31,"Text: 'To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to have a special race. The race was between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same place. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

â€˜Iâ€™m excited,â€™ Jonny said at the start line. â€˜Iâ€™ve never done this before. The roads have beautiful views, and itâ€™s very cold, so Iâ€™ll stay warm in the car.â€™ Alistair was also excited. He wore winter cycling clothes, while Jonny wore jeans and a sweatshirt. Alistair joked, â€˜Iâ€™ve seen Jonny drive before, so Iâ€™m not sure he will make it. I might stop for a cup of tea on the way.â€™

The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Fleet Moss, the highest road in Yorkshire. It was easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill on his bike. After a quick handshake, they started. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside, while Jonny drove the car on the road.

Jonny had a problem right away. A big tractor came onto the road. â€˜Welcome to Yorkshire,â€™ he said to the cameraman in his car. â€˜If Alistair wins, itâ€™s because of this farmer!â€™ After the tractor moved, Jonny continued driving. Alistair struggled with the hill and had to carry his bike. Sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. 

Finally, Alistair reached the top of the hill. He rode fast across the open ground. Jonny had another problem with narrow roads in the villages. He drove slowly through a stream on the road. After the last village, Jonny drove fast to the finish line. 

Neither brother knew where the other was. Jonny drove quickly to Fleet Moss, while Alistair rode across the last field and onto the road. Alistair reached the finish line first. He asked the crowd, â€˜Is he here?â€™ When they said no, he raised his arms and said, â€˜Yes!â€™ A few minutes later, Jonny arrived. â€˜Well done,â€™ Jonny said sadly. â€˜Iâ€™m disappointed.â€™'"
32,"Text: 'When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the soft grass. You throw it up to serve and hit it. You hear the sound of your own shot. The grass, the old stadium, the players in white, and the quiet crowd make you feel like you are in a different world. The quiet helps me play better. I try to think only about the game and the point I am playing. When a point is over, there is noise: clapping, cheering, and people shouting my name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I do not think about the 15,000 people watching me or the millions watching on TV. I am playing Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me it was the most important tournament. When I was 14, I told my friends I wanted to play and win there one day. Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer twice. In 2006, I was happy just to be there. Federer beat me easily because I did not believe I could win. In 2007, I lost again and felt very sad. I knew I could have played better. I cried a lot after that loss. Losing hurts more when you have a chance to win. My uncle Toni is a tough coach. He usually does not comfort me, even when I win. But after that loss, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I told him he did not understand, that it was my last chance. I know a sports career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I missed a big one in 2007. But Toni was right. I had another chance in 2008. I learned from my loss in 2007. I was sure I would win this time. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends. We did not talk about the match. They knew I was already thinking about it in my mind. Until the match started, I wanted to keep that space in my head for myself.'"
33,"Text: 'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in April 1957. She loved Africa and decided to live there for most of her life. Jane became famous for her work with chimpanzees. In 1963, she became well-known because of articles and TV shows about her research. She wrote many books, including a popular one called ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which is in 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. She helped us understand chimpanzees better. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. They also did not know that chimpanzees have emotions and social systems like humans. Jane's book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is very important for chimpanzee research. Her study in Gombe, Nigeria, is a great scientific achievement. Jane changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves. Even as a child, Jane was curious. When she was five, she hid in a henhouse for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity showed she would become a great biologist.'"
34,"Shirley Ford is a voice actor. She can speak like a young boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. People know her voices from children's TV shows and cartoons. She also does voices for work programs about health and safety. Shirley says she just did a voiceover about back injuries and had to learn medical words.

Shirley explains that doing voiceovers is more than just funny voices. You have to make the script interesting for people who can't see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they often don't get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.

After school, Shirley studied drama. She sang songs for TV ads sometimes. One day, someone asked her to try a voice for a rabbit in a cartoon. She thought it was funny but tried it and got a big part. Shirley found out she was good at voices and decided to do more voiceover work. In her second film, she played the main character and her brother and mother.

Adult women often do voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter. It's also easier than hiring child actors. Shirley learns new voices by watching children's TV. She does many types of voice work, like educational videos and ads for vacuum cleaners. She says it's hard to sound excited about things she doesn't care about, but smiling while talking helps.

The competition for voice work is tough. A good showreel, which is a recording of what you can do, is important. Shirley says it's good to invest in a strong showreel. She got to the top of her job by working hard and not giving up. She suggests going to special workshops for voiceover work. Shirley loves voices and sometimes keeps speaking in a character's voice even after work. Her children are used to her talking in different voices."
35,"Text: 'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because being a cartoonist is a fun job, like being a race car driver. Many people stop dreaming about these jobs and think about more common jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make money by drawing little pictures like the ones in school notebooks. But some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school papers, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college. After college, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted cartoons about local news. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money to live. To be a cartoonist, you donâ€™t need a university degree, much money, or even to draw well. You need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. Being a cartoonist is hard. You should only try if you feel you can't do anything else. Itâ€™s easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making money with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I donâ€™t say no to work because you can learn a lot from jobs you donâ€™t really want to do. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about everything. What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs at newspapers and magazines. But now, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to make and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than very talented artists. Some people worry someone will steal their ideas, even if they have never sold a cartoon. They donâ€™t let others see their work. To protect your work, you can draw a little â€˜câ€™ for â€˜copyright,â€™ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But itâ€™s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone steals a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it can be a lucky break!'"
36,"Text: Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house. I decided to throw away an electric guitar. My dad gave it to me for my 16th birthday. It was a black guitar from Japan. I usually keep old things, but I wanted to throw this guitar away. I took it to the rubbish dump. A young man saw me and asked, ""Are you really going to throw that away?"" I said yes. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. Later, I felt sad about giving it away. 

A few months ago, I got an email from a man named Keith Rushton. He fixes guitars. He said, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar was sold many times after I gave it away. Keith found my name on the guitar and found me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He wanted to sell the guitar back to me. I was very happy. Keith's price was fair. 

My dad used to put name stickers on my things, like my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar. It was popular in the 1970s. I liked the sound, but I was not good at it. So, I started playing the electric guitar. It was the time of punk music, and you didn't have to play well to be a rock star. 

When I got my guitar back, I remembered my birthday in 1978. My parents gave me the guitar. It felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I picked it up and played it. My fingers remembered the chords. Playing the electric guitar hurt my fingers a bit. 

The electric guitar is not for playing alone. I want to play in a band. My son plays the saxophone. Maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people like me. We could call our band ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There is a lot of talk about sleep now. I wrote a book called ""Insomniac"" about people who cannot sleep well. I talked about how not sleeping enough is bad for our minds, bodies, and moods. People who cannot sleep know how important sleep is. Now, more people are talking about sleep, which is good. But what about dreams? We do not hear much about dreams. When we wake up early, we lose the last part of sleep, which is called REM sleep. This is when we dream the most. Good sleepers spend a lot of time in REM sleep. If someone lives 90 years, they spend about six or seven years dreaming. When people do not get enough REM sleep, they have more REM sleep the next night. This shows dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep. Many people agreed with Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, who said dreams help us understand our minds. But later, researchers found that dreams are more about the brain's physical work. Now, researchers do not agree on many things about dreams. Dreams are important. A study showed that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams more than other people. People who like to be creative use their dreams more. Filmmakers, for example, have a strong connection with dreams because movies are like dreams. But everyone, like teachers and software designers, needs to be creative. Dreams help us think in new ways. When people wake up from REM sleep and say what they think about a word, their answers are more original. This is creativity. I write better after dreaming. Even if a dream is hard to remember, it helps me think. Creativity is not just for artists. We all need to think creatively in our lives. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small town by the sea in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, you can see the sea and photos of her two daughters, but no paintings. Susie is a famous copyist artist. She can paint like famous artists from the past, such as Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her paintings look so real that even art experts think they are the originals. The real paintings are worth millions, but Susie's copies sell for a few hundred to Â£12,000, depending on how long she works on them. 

Susie has many clients, including galleries and private collectors. Some people buy her paintings to show off, pretending they are real. One famous person likes to say he has a Van Gogh, but it is really a Susie Ray copy. Some people keep the real painting in a bank and hang Susie's copy at home to save on insurance. 

Susie is honest about her work. She signs her name on the back of her paintings. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and Susie does not do that. She knows people who have done it and got into trouble. Susie is not rich, but she is happy with her work and does not want to risk her reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She did not earn much money, but it helped her learn to draw accurately. She tells young artists to learn to draw well and study a lot. Susie can draw many things, but she likes French impressionist artists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas the most. 

Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie says it is not. The impressionists painted quickly but carefully, and it is hard to do both. Susie does not paint her own original art because she is a perfectionist. She once tried painting fishing nets, but they looked like photos. Susie is happy with her work and makes a good living from it."
39,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and wanted to be the fastest sailor. She started sailing when she was a child. Ellen felt very close to her boats. When she was on land, she missed the ocean and wanted to sail again. She once came second in a big race called the VendÃ©e Globe, where she sailed alone around the world without stopping. 

Ellen showed me her small boat, Kingfisher, where she lived for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, like how much food and kitchen paper she needed. She had freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and medical supplies. Her boat was very important to her because it kept her safe.

Ellen now thinks the world is like a boat. It is small and needs care. She realized this on a trip to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. She saw old whaling stations and thought about how people take too much from the Earth.

Ellen wants to help save the planet. She says we need to stop using things like coal, oil, and gas because they will run out. She talks about re-using things and has visited many factories and power stations. Ellen started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to teach young people about a better future.

Ellen misses the adventure of sailing, but she thinks helping the planet is more important. She wants to use her voice to make a difference."
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he could become very famous. Many young people play on computers and games, but Jordan wants to show them they can do big things too, like climbing mountains or going outside more. 

Jordan's team includes his dad, Paul, and his mom, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero'. Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and another mountain in Antarctica, he will be the youngest to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are 30 years old. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains.

Some people think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say a young person might be strong but may not have enough experience or emotional strength. The Romeros know people think this way. Paul says they think about the risks but believe their experience will help. He feels confident because Jordan is becoming strong and mature.

Some wonder if Jordan's dad is pushing him too hard. Paul says it is not about him wanting to be famous. They talk to Jordan to make sure he still wants to climb. Jordan says he likes the challenge and focuses on his goal.

Today, many people want to be the youngest or fastest to do something. They write about their adventures online, and people are interested in these records. Jordan needs to share his story to inspire others. This means he has to blog, take photos, and give interviews. He needs to do something big, like climbing Everest.

Paul says if Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, they will stop the project and support him."
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask them about Brahms, they might not know who he is. I am studying music at university, but my classmates do not know much about classical music either. If you do not know the music, you probably do not have any recordings of it. Not many people go to classical music concerts. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music. Classical music recordings do not sell many copies. 

Why do people not like classical music anymore? Some older people think TV and video games are the reason, but I do not agree. Classical music is not very interesting to most people, especially teenagers. Teenagers buy most of the music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who like classical music, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I am not a big fan of classical music. I like many types of music, but I do not listen to much classical music.

Why do teenagers not like classical music? Classical music changes speed and mood a lot, which is hard for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Experts say we cannot pay attention for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical music but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to. It also talks about things teenagers care about, unlike classical music, which has no words.

The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home. Now, we can find any music online, but we do not often choose classical music. Shops do not play classical music in the background. One of my teachers says more people go to classical concerts now, but not many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play in many places, but the audience is mostly older people. Teenagers often do not like what their parents like.

Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids like to play it in school orchestras. They practice a lot, but when they relax, they choose pop music instead.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mom's car and looked at Almonside School. ""I'll make you sorry I came here,"" she said to the school. Her mom didn't hear her. Bonnie's mom knew how she felt. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden among trees. It was confusing. Bonnie saw a sign that said ""Riding Centre"" and got interested. Her mom said, ""Headmaster's study. This way."" Bonnie followed her mom on a path between trees. Her mom said, ""I wish you'd walk beside me,"" but Bonnie didn't. 

Soon, her mom was talking to the headmaster, and Bonnie waited outside. Bonnie thought, ""Why should I just sit here? I'll be in trouble soon anyway."" She left and went to the riding centre. There was a nice building for horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie liked horses and treated them with respect. She looked at each horse. 

She found a horse she liked. ""Aren't you the best!"" she said. The horse was brown with some white. His name was Maverick. Bonnie wanted to ride him. She found a room with riding equipment. It was open. She put a saddle on Maverick and forgot about her mom and the headmaster. 

When she sat on Maverick, she felt like a queen. Her old school called her Queen Bee. She laughed. ""You're the best horse I've ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said. She made him walk and then trot. ""If I stay here, we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The wind felt nice on her face. She knew Maverick trusted her and would jump well."

Cody started playing the guitar when he was six years old. He began writing songs at seven. He also liked swimming and surfing. When he was 13, he put some videos online. These videos changed his life. 

Cody and a friend sang at a school concert. People liked the videos and wanted more. Cody made more videos at home. Many people loved them. Cody was also a good swimmer. He trained with top coaches. But then, music companies wanted to work with him. Cody had to choose: stay in Australia and swim or move to the US and sing. Cody chose to sing. 

It was hard for Cody to decide. He was only 12 or 13 years old. He told his swimming coach and friends he was moving to the US. They were surprised. Cody is a quiet person. He and his family moved to the US. His family helps him but stays out of the spotlight. Cody thinks it is important to have good people around you. 

Sometimes, Cody worries about his family. His little brother is eight years old. He travels a lot and does school on the road. Cody's family supports him and tells him not to worry. Success comes from saying 'yes' to big chances, even if they are scary. Cody is happy to visit new countries and play for many fans. But he knows it will not last forever."
44,"I woke up and looked out my bedroom window at the river. The ice on the river was starting to crack in the morning sun. Last week, I helped the town put sandbags by the river to stop flooding. It was hard work, and my back still hurt. I saw a boy I didn't know trying to walk on the ice near the warm water from the factory. I put on my kayaking wetsuit and checked my pocket for a special silver chain. My grandfather gave it to me from his trip to South America. I also have his diary from that trip, which I read at night.

I went to the kitchen. ""Morning, Rex,"" Mom said with a smile. ""You're up early. I'll make brunch after your training. Be careful."" ""Thanks, Mom,"" I said. I almost bumped into Grandpa in the hallway. ""Watch where you're going!"" he shouted. ""Where are you going?"" ""Kayaking,"" I said. Grandpa often gets angry, but I try to ignore it. He said, ""What's the point of training? You didn't win the competition."" His words hurt, but I took a deep breath. He went into the bathroom, and Mom gave me a kind smile. ""Don't mind him,"" she said. ""He's not himself right now."" I used to think Grandpa was a hero. He has photos in National Geographic and medals in his room. I don't go in there anymore. I have my own trophies now, and maybe one day, I'll be in National Geographic too. But I still care about him.

Mom said, ""At least he's coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination!"" I smiled and said, ""It'll be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my trip."" She laughed, and I went outside to the boathouse."
45,"Mum held Jess's arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table was a painting by Grandpa. It was not finished and looked different from his other paintings. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I haven't seen it before. I didn't know he was painting."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a big river, but it didn't look real. It was strange and beautiful. There were no animals or people in the picture. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded different, like she was excited. Grandpa never named his pictures. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa wrote. Jess read them: ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn't know why. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Yes, it's strange,"" Mum said. ""Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it."" ""Mum! You shouldn't have asked."" ""I know, but I was curious. It's unusual for him to name a picture. You can guess what he said."" Jess knew. Grandpa would say that a painting speaks for itself, like a poem. He would say it's not the artist's job to explain it. Mum laughed. ""Something like that. I thought you might know about this painting because you inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" Jess knew the word. Grandpa used it when she watched him paint. He would say the muse wasn't helping him or he needed to be nice to the muse. She thought the muse was a goddess, not a person. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"Text: 'This morning, I did not plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I am not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. Maybe if I tripped with Dadâ€™s knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet. I did not wake up thinking, â€˜Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.â€™ It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small, white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran kept china ornaments in it. I keep shells, fossils, and stones there. I was happy when Gran gave it to me! But it is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It needs to be in a corner. My bedroom is small, like a wedge of cheese, with only two corners. The big bedroom is Mum and Dadâ€™s; the back one is my sister Angelaâ€™s; the one over the garage is my brother Tomâ€™s; and the smallest one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But Angela is only fifteen, so I will be in my small room for a long time. I donâ€™t mind; I like my cosy room. The roof slopes down, and the window is at floor level. The problem is, there are not enough corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to put Granâ€™s cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a little too tall. I thought, if I canâ€™t cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. Dad calls this â€˜lateral thinkingâ€™. He always tells us to â€˜think outside the boxâ€™. That is what I was doing!'"
47,"The book 'The Borrowers' is about a family of very small people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to live. I was asked to make a TV show from the book. I knew it would be hard because people who love the book have strong ideas about it. I used the book's drawings a lot because I didn't want people to say I did it wrong. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' view, not humans', which made filming harder. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to film from far away. The crew had to film from low to show the Borrowers' view, and they wore out many jeans! We never lifted the cameras higher than the Borrowers, except for some shots from above. A big challenge was making the shadows look right when we mixed the small Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We made a special way to do this. After the show was on TV, a famous director, George Lucas, called to ask how we did it. We built the Borrowers' home under the floor with big objects to make the actors look small. It was funny and strange. The actors had to carry big things like giant scissors, and it made everyone laugh. There was a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. The actors were really scared because they had to go down a tunnel with water hoses. Getting the costumes right was important. The clothes were made from heavy material, so they looked like doll clothes. The main actress couldn't sit or take off her dress because it was sewn on. The main actor's trousers were made from a rug. It was very hot during filming, and the actors didn't like the costumes. Most scenes away from the Borrowers' home were filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. They had to pretend things were there. I drew 2,000 pictures to show how each scene should look. We didn't have much money, so I worked at night for three months. We worked fast, and once I filmed a scene without film in the camera. But in the end, the show was good and showed the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, but there are no journalists. I wonder how long it will be before people start asking for free tickets to my dad's concerts. ""Everything will be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her finger and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school alone. I wanted this change to get away from my old life. My dad's band is here to record music, and we are staying. I wanted to meet normal kids. Maybe kids with parents who work regular jobs. 

I walk into the school office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the secretary. ""Name?"" she asks. ""Desert McGraw,"" I reply. She seems confused but types my last name. My dad uses a stage name, so people don't recognize my last name. ""What grade?"" she asks. ""Eleventh,"" I answer. She prints my schedule and gives it to me. My first class is English Literature. I like English, so that's good. I studied the school map last night, so I know where to go. 

When I get to the classroom, the teacher is calling names. I quietly sit at a desk. The girl next to me smiles and says, ""Nice shoes."" I look at my fancy shoes and think I should have worn something simpler. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher calls my name, ""Desert McGraw?"" ""Here,"" I reply. The teacher, Ms. Smigla, talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. Then she lets us talk to each other. 

""Why did you move here?"" the girl next to me asks. I have many reasons. My dad said we needed a change and this place is good for recording music. But I think he just wants to relax on the beach. ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. ""What does he do?"" she asks. I know people will find out soon, but for now, I say, ""He's an artist."" ""Cool. I'm Becca,"" she says. She doesn't seem to care much, which is great."
49,"Text: 'Today, American teenage girls have many things to do. They need to be leaders at school, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in everything. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average. They have a lot of pressure. Teenagers have homework, tests, activities after school, jobs, chores at home, and they also try to have a social life. Kristen, a teenager, says people forget how hard it is for teenagers today. Even with all this work, people still think teenagers are lazy and only care about themselves. Kristen says this is not true. She uses her phone to help with her work, not just for fun. Teenagers need to be connected all the time. They use phones and tablets to do homework anywhere. Schoolwork does not stop at school; it needs attention all the time. Many teenagers wake up at 6 or 7 a.m. and go to bed after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. Only 20% of teenagers get the right amount of sleep. Some even fall asleep in school because they are so tired. Lindamarie, another teenager, says she has only 18 hours of free time each week. She uses this time to help others, not just for social media or TV. She likes to volunteer and help her community. In the future, teenagers will keep showing they are not just lazy. They will continue to make a difference in the world before they finish school.'"
50,"The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers from Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. They have sent over fifty balloons high into the sky, about 35 km up. This is a science project that is also an adventure, which is why many teenagers like it. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were going to send a balloon up to try and see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and makes a light trail. 

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside the box, there was a camera, a tool to measure how high the balloon goes, and a thermometer to check temperature changes. They also put two GPS trackers on the lunch box to find it later. A gas tank, given by someone from a nearby state, was used to fill the balloon with gas. The balloon grew as big as a small car. An older boy drove a long way to get the gas tank. â€˜I didnâ€™t really mind,â€™ he said. For these kids, this is normal. 

Finally, it was time to let the balloon go. They counted down, â€˜Five, four, three, two, one,â€™ and the balloon went up. Some kids ran and watched it with flashlights until it was out of sight. There was a quiet feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but some stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets and looked at the clear sky. It was hard to believe they were just four hours from Los Angeles, a big city with many people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. â€˜Weâ€™re the only ones talking,â€™ said one girl quietly. â€˜I know,â€™ whispered another. A meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon went up, the air pressure got lower, and the balloon got bigger until it popped. A parachute helped the lunch box come back to Earth safely. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but thatâ€™s part of the fun. The lunch box usually lands far from people. â€˜Finding the lunch box is a big part of the program,â€™ said the groupâ€™s leader. They have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. â€˜We learn about the land in a way we wouldnâ€™t normally,â€™ he said. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, they had to drive around the mountains. Then they had to decide if they should drive or walk to it. It could be hard if the lunch box was on a high mountain or in a tall tree. â€˜These students are from the Eastern Sierra,â€™ their leader said. â€˜What seems wild to some is normal to them.â€™ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was on a flat rock in a waterfall. The camera didnâ€™t record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but it was a chance to talk about how waves in the air work over mountains. And it was another adventure story to tell."
51,"Chloe Morgan didn't like science or Palaeontology much until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. Her younger brother loved dinosaurs, but Chloe didn't care about them. She helped him with a science project and read an article about new dinosaur discoveries. It amazed her, and she knew she wanted to learn more about it.

Chloe met a famous palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius. She was nervous at first, but he was friendly and listened to her questions. This made her feel comfortable.

Chloe talks about how movies like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs, but they don't show what palaeontologists really do. In movies, they are shown as strange or nerdy, which is not true. Chloe's job is different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, and writes for science magazines. She also likes to talk to people about science, especially young people, to help them understand it better.

Chloe helped with a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She made sure the dinosaurs looked right and lived at the same time. The show was popular because it showed dinosaurs in a new way, different from movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe thinks dinosaurs are interesting because they make us curious and want to explore. They remind us there is still a lot to learn about the world. Palaeontology is like traveling back in time."
52,"Text: ""I will say this one time: when you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not 'there yet' when you ask 'Are we there yet?' When you arrive, it is not 'there' anymore; it is 'here.' So, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' Parents want to be 'there' more than kids do because they hear this question many times on long trips. 

Kids should not complain. You can relax in the back seat, watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the car moves. Your mom or dad is in the front seat, giving you juice and cookies, changing the radio, and making sure everything is okay. 

But sometimes, my little brother Tim does something bad, like putting his foot on my side of the seat. I do the same, and then we fight. Mom or dad stops us and tells Tim to stay in his seat. 

Later, I feel air on my arm. Tim is blowing on me from his seat. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. I get angry, and Tim gets in trouble again. 

Dad has ways to make us quiet. When we ask 'Are we there yet?' he says, 'Yes, get out of the car.' But we are still on the highway! Then he says, 'Oh, maybe we are not there yet.' This makes us quiet for a while. 

You know you are 'there' when mom and dad get out of the car and walk away from the kids. So remember, if mom and dad can still answer your question, you are not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a cafÃ© in Oxford, UK. In their cafÃ©, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi want people to have fun and come back again. Zuzi says they started the cafÃ© because people use their phones and gadgets too much. They want people to talk and be together without screens.

In their cafÃ©, people play games called 'Eurogames'. These games have simple themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade with each other. Everyone stays involved until the end.

Some games are 'co-operative', meaning players work together as a team. One example is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players solve problems together. Leacock was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings. He wanted to make games that are fun whether you win or lose.

Leacock loved games since he was a child. He used to feel disappointed with some games, so he tried to make better ones with his uncle. Pandemic became very popular. It tells a story, like a video game, where players develop characters and face new challenges.

Video games have helped board games become popular. Many people play games on their phones now. Ben Hogg, who works for a games company, says more people are open to playing games today.

Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many play online, away from each other. Some people miss playing games with others in person. John and Zuzi's cafÃ© shows that board games are a way to connect with others in real life. This trend is growing."
54,"Jamie Scott is a famous music writer and producer from the UK. His story shows that working hard and not giving up are important in music. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. At home, he listened to a radio station for older people, which influenced him. He first heard a modern song when he was 12. Around that time, he had to choose between playing tennis and music. He played tennis very well, but he loved music more. At 17, he left school to become a musician. He was in a music group with a friend, but his friend did not want to make music a career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to make music. His dad said he had 18 months to succeed or get a job. Jamie got a music deal at 19 because of one song, but he had to leave his friend to be a solo artist. He found success writing songs for others, not performing. Jamie says he is one of the top writers in the UK. He helps new artists by writing songs that can be very popular. He believes writing songs that many people like is good. Jamie wants to write big hit songs and is not shy about it. He focuses on making great pop songs that people will love."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of famous person. He is very popular online, but many people who do not watch online videos might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist.' This means he does tricks on a bike, like jumping from a roof to a wall. These tricks are filmed and shared online.

I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many local boys and older people knew him and called him a 'legend.' After watching his tricks, I agreed. Tony is brave and creative. Before each trick, he tells me what he plans to do. Sometimes I can't believe he will succeed, but he always does. When I praise him, he seems not very interested. Even though he is famous online, Tony does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans and prefers doing tricks instead.

Tony's fame comes from social media and cameras. He says this technology helps him make money from his videos. In the past, people like him would only have a hobby. Tony says many people are always looking at screens, but he is not complaining.

I learned that to be a top athlete, you need energy and the ability to keep going after failure. These are more important than talent. Tony sometimes falls but gets up and tries again until he succeeds.

Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some people say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people do not understand his sport. He gets advice from experts to stay safe. Tony is careful about risks. He feels fear but finds a way to overcome it. He plans and prepares a lot before trying a new trick. He knows he must be confident when he jumps."

Her latest challenge was walking on a high wire. The wire was 66 meters above the ground. It was between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net. She wore a belt attached to another wire above her. She carried a long stick to help her balance. The stick weighed eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert how to walk on the wire. She found it very hard. She said, â€˜The training was a shock. I didnâ€™t know I needed to be so strong.â€™ Every day, she ran up a hill at 8 am. Then she did exercises for two hours. She also learned how to fall on the wire safely. Falling hurt, but she had to stay positive. If she was nervous, the wire would shake. On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths and walked slowly. The walk was 150 meters and took 15 minutes. She said, â€˜That was the scariest thing Iâ€™ve done. Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s over!â€™ Helen is now planning her next charity project. She wants to go to the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."

Before this, Jeff wrote a book about traveling in Canada in an old car. He loved motor sports and worked on racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even went to Amsterdam on it for a holiday. This trip made him want to see the world by bike. Jeff didnâ€™t want a normal bike, so he decided to build a penny farthing himself. He learned how to make it by visiting a museum. After two tries in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally started his trip in 2006. He traveled for three years and visited 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was seeing Mount Everest in Tibet. Even though he met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which he couldnâ€™t do, he was happy with his penny farthing. People were amazed by his bike the further he traveled from home. The worst part of his trip was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in bed for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. But Jeff says, â€˜if I had the money, I would travel again tomorrow on my penny farthing.â€™"
58,"I work at a university in the US. My team and I study water birds. We are learning about a bird called the American black duck. We use a special tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see ducks in the dark. We are worried because there are fewer black ducks now. We do not know if they have enough food on the east coast. We know what they do in the day, but not at night. Before, we did not have the right tools. But now, with the 'scope', we can see them clearly at night. This will help us take care of the places where they live. 

The work is hard. There are four people on our team. Each person works six hours every day. We study ducks in different places. I take a boat to some places and write notes about the ducks I see. The weather is not always good. Some nights are nice, but many nights are wet. It is very quiet, so I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake! We only missed one day of work because of deep snow. I like the challenge. In summer, we will work in a lab. We will look at our results together. It will be hard to stay inside, but it is important.

60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many things, like juggling, throwing and catching balls, and even fire. Students also learn trapeze, which is flying through the air. During the year-long course, students take more risks in each class, and sometimes parents come to watch. Sophia says that to be good in the circus, performers need to do different things and keep shows exciting. They must practice a lot. Making friends with other performers and learning from them is also important. Circus artists need to be fit, like athletes, and they train every day. The best performers want to succeed, have imagination, and always try to get better. Some people think circus performers get hurt a lot or only work a little each year. But the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel with the circus when you are young. The course also teaches business planning. Many students start their own businesses around the world and share their stories. Sophia says it's not a job to make a lot of money. The work doesn't have a regular salary, and it's competitive, but it's a lot of fun!'"

The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to feel more confident. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert. 

A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She liked it so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Ana was the youngest student, but she knew a lot about music. However, the teacher did not listen to her ideas, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about how this made her feel. She put the song online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the words.

Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, came from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know the company and did not want anyone to tell her what to sing. But Joss promised this would not happen, and soon Ana performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a great night.

Ana likes to write songs about difficult times because she has more to say then. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him sad. Ana hopes people like her songs, but she wants to write about things that are important to her."

He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not. I wanted to visit the area because I saw it on TV when I was a child. Our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. I asked Harry if I could go too, and he said yes! 

A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather was good when we got there. I was busy at work, so I did not have much time to plan. But Harry said he took care of everything, so I stopped worrying. 

When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group. We packed our things into small boats and started the trip. The guide said not many people lived along the coast. On the first morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands far away, but it was foggy, so we could not see them well. I watched the nice patterns our boat made in the water. 

We often stopped to look at rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish. I did not know many of them. It was nice not to worry about time. We always made lunch and dinner together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it was very relaxing. 

When it was time to leave, I was sad. I did not want to go back to normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad played basketball in Germany. His dad also played basketball. When I was a kid, I watched many of my dad's games. You might think I would love basketball, but I didn't. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, but I took a book to read instead of watching the games.

When I started secondary school, I was not a teenager yet, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I liked the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I played against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it was OK!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did well. I joined an adult team before moving to a sports school in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic players, and it was great to work with him. But I missed my parents. At home, I didn't spend much time with friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. I got used to my new life, and my English got better too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after going to the USA. I was taller than most players, but I needed to gain weight. My coach knew a team for me, so I joined them while still in college. I am happy I did."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and found out I really liked it. I saw my city in a new way, like the tourists did. After I finished college, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I needed to learn a lot more. In Chicago, guides must answer many questions about the city, like its buildings, history, and transport. After some hard months, I got my tour guide license. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You need to be fun and tell good stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy the tour, not hear about problems. I make sure my tours are good so visitors are happy. Happy visitors give good reviews online, which helps me get more customers. I work hard to make my tours fun, and people often recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help as volunteers at a place for elephants. This place helps sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would like the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this kind of work. But in the end, we did not need to worry.

One of our main jobs was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie thought it was hard work, but I liked seeing the elephants happy. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even if I got very wet!

In the evening, we took the elephants to the forest where they slept. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we knew it would be like that. The food was very good, and there was no meat, which we liked. After dinner, we talked and played games with the other volunteers and staff.

Now we are back in the UK. Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked it, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little upset because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy it fully. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day â€“ I know I will!"
69,"I'm Gina Dâ€™Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many people. Some people buy flowers for friends or their homes. Hotels and offices also buy flowers for their reception areas. Sometimes, we help with photo sessions by giving flowers for pictures. Once, I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very happy with it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping then, and my friends think I am crazy. But I love my job, so I donâ€™t mind. It is often cold and dark, but that is normal at that time. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. There are so many colors and smells. If I chose for myself, I would pick pink flowers because they are my favorite. But I have to remember that other people might like different flowers. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I cannot find what customers want.

I donâ€™t like arguing about prices with the flower-sellers, but it is part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and put flowers in vases. Then we make flower bunches and decide how much they will cost. Customers are sometimes surprised by the price, and I ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much work, but I enjoy making the best flower bunches for the money people want to spend. I love my job and wouldnâ€™t want to do anything else!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows new films and kids' films on weekends. It is close to my home. But a year ago, I wanted to talk about films with people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends! We did not want to rent a cinema. Instead, we pick a new place in the city each month. Once, we used an old factory to show a film about Antarctica. It was very cold, which made it feel like the film! Some places are free because they sell snacks during the film, so we can keep ticket prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own equipment. We sell tickets online, so we know how many people are coming. There is always a lot to do, but when people say they had a great time, it feels wonderful. Our website helps us connect with other film clubs in the country. We visit them to see how they do things, but we love our own club. We also started a blog because people look online for film information. We put up posters in cafÃ©s, but people telling their friends about us works best. The audience loves our special activities, like last month's movie quiz, which everyone enjoyed."
71,"Text: 'When I was a child, I loved taking photos. At 15, I wanted to do something special with my hobby. I decided to take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers did this, and I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I liked taking photos of many things. Someone told me to focus on one topic to make my project better. I agreed and started taking photos of nature, like birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different because others took color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost stopped. But I trusted myself and felt better about my style. I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photo competition for people my age. I entered my photos for fun. I was so happy when I won first prize. It was the first time I thought my photography was good. I now have my own photo studio and I am happy with my career choice.'"
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn new skills like speaking in front of people. In NYC, you can do many activities and learn new things. There are different levels, from easy to hard, and adults called 'leaders' help you. When you finish a level, you get a certificate.

When I joined, my leader asked me to help at a local children's club for two hours a week. I was not sure because I went to that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and other kids already had friends, so I stopped going. But I wanted my first NYC certificate, so I tried it.

Soon, I loved spending time at the children's club. It was more than just getting a certificate. After I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep helping at the club because I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week and I really enjoy it.

Because of my time at the club, I want to go to college in three years to become a youth worker, someone who helps children. I never thought about this job before. This is my favorite part of NYC, and I have learned to talk better with people while helping others. I have more NYC certificates now, and one is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and had not thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. After this, I started to love snowboarding and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people get bored of snowboarding, but I still love it. I like to win, and this makes me try harder. I enjoy not having a fixed plan. Once, I got a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I was not sure I would try the jumps, but I did, and it made me trust myself more. In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I do not have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend time with my friends. It helps me when I cannot snowboard. I think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I want to have another plan in case I do not become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time to study at college. I love snowboarding, but I know I cannot do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I did not think about the future. I did not know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could have a phone if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. This was a good lesson for me. I worked every Saturday in a cafÃ©, but I did not like it. My parents said I could start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it was hard, but it was easy for me. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home. I sold my first jewellery to my friends and family. They said they liked them, but I thought they just wanted to make me happy. I wanted to know if other people liked them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery to give as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country wanted to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum. Then, I knew it could work, so I made a website. Now, I make a lot of money from my business, mostly online. We still have our market stall too. It has been a lot of fun."
75,"When Janine Stuart was 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is a little bit about Janineâ€™s own life. In an interview, Janine said, ""My family moved a lot because of my dadâ€™s job, so I got good at making new friends. I know how it feels to be the new student in a class, and this helped me write about Amelia, the main character, starting at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Ameliaâ€™s life at home, especially with her older brother. I donâ€™t have brothers or sisters, so I used my imagination for that."" Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mom always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers told her to write, so it was a good way for Janine to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story competition on a website for young writers. Because of this, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they wanted to read it right away. They loved it, and a year later, Janineâ€™s book was in stores. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the book cover has happy teenagers, the story is about people facing hard problems, which makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than some other famous authors. Janine is still getting used to being famous: ""At first, I hid when people knew me on the street, but now itâ€™s OK. I want to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just spend time with my friends, and then I have something interesting to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom. I'm fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad got a job as the castle's manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings. At first, we were not sure about moving. We thought the castle might not be as nice as our home, and there was no school on the island. But after we moved, we got used to it. The castle is not very pretty, but our apartment is nice. In summer, many people visit the island, and there are parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families on the island. There are not many teenagers, which I hoped for. The adults help each other with work on the island. The biggest change for me is taking a boat to school every day. I like going on stormy days with big waves, but the boats don't go then. If I miss the bus to the boat after school, I miss the last boat home. So, I tell my friends to hurry when they visit. We see great views, like the sunset over the sea. Sometimes it's foggy, and then sunny again. It's amazing. We have bad storms, and I worry about the castle. But it has been here for a long time, so I think it will be okay."
77,"I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby called birdwatching. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds there. My parents taught me how to know different birds and where to find them. It was fun! When I came back home, I joined a birdwatchers' club for young people. I want to see 200 different kinds of birds. I have seen many birds on family holidays in other countries. We always look for places with birdwatching activities. I have been to Egypt and South America. I hoped to see my 200th bird in South America, but I didn't. I learned that I need to be patient. I made a video about my birdwatching challenge. Many teenagers liked it and said it was interesting. My teachers saw the video and asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was nervous, but I had notes to help me. After the talk, my teachers said I did well. I might do another talk next year. I am happy to live in the countryside. I know teenagers in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds in green areas. Birdwatching clubs should help more young people enjoy this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, and it doesn't cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved playing football, and soon I became a good player. My family thought I would stop playing, like I did with other hobbies. But I didnâ€™t stop. I dreamed of playing football as a job when I grew up. 

One day, I played in a local game, and a referee saw that I was a good player. He told the manager of a professional womenâ€™s club to watch me play. The manager liked how I played and asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didnâ€™t know young girls could join womenâ€™s clubs. I started training with the club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at football. 

Some people didnâ€™t think I would be a star player, and that made me a little sad. But my coach told me to believe in myself. He let me play in a big match. I ran very hard because I didnâ€™t want to lose. By luck, I scored the winning goal. I heard my coach cheering for me, and after the match, my team carried me around the field. It was amazing! 

Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. We want teenagers to like football and talk to other players in my club. They can see what itâ€™s like to play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them is the same as my coachâ€™s advice to me: you will have good times and bad times. I have had mostly good times, so I am lucky!"
79,"Text: In the UK and other countries, schools and universities want students to start doing research early. Research is not just for famous scientists or big universities. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research helps in school and at work. It is about asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? 

Research can be big and complex or small and simple. It starts with asking questions and looking for answers. Students have done research in school projects and at work. You do research when you plan a holiday, grow plants, fix things, train a dog, or shop online.

In college, you need to ask questions, find problems, and think about what you read or hear. In some places, people think knowledge is already known, and you learn by listening to teachers. But in the UK, US, and other places, you should question what you learn. 

Critical thinking is important in research. You should not just repeat what you read. Think about it and see if it makes sense. Check if the information is true and backed by evidence. Do not just believe everything you read or hear."
80,"Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the past, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafÃ©s. But living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso moved to the countryside later. 

Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural. Scientists are studying how cities affect our brains. They found that city life can make us tired and think less clearly. One reason is the lack of nature. Seeing trees or nature helps our brains relax. For example, hospital patients get better faster when they see trees from their windows.

More people live in cities now than ever before. We live in crowded places with many people around us. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a busy city street, our brain has to pay attention to many things, like people and traffic. This makes us tired because our brain uses a lot of energy to focus.

Nature is different. It helps our brain relax and feel better. This idea is called attention restoration theory. It means that being in nature helps our brain rest and recharge. Parks in cities, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. Just a short walk in a park can help our brain work better.

Even though city life can be hard, cities are still places where new ideas happen. The busy streets and many people help create new things. Scientists say that social interactions in cities lead to creativity. Cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are successful because of this. 

The challenge is to make city life better for our minds while keeping its benefits. People still want to live in cities because they are exciting and full of life."
81,"Text: 'Where is the mind? Many people think the mind is only in our heads. We have special machines that show us the brain working. But I think the mind is not just inside our heads. There is a lot of proof that things outside our heads, like tools and writing, help us think. For example, old stone tools and writing systems have helped humans grow and change. So, maybe the mind is also outside the head. 

When scientists study the mind, they often look at the brain alone. This is because they use machines that only look at the brain. But we also think with things around us. I believe the mind is more than just the brain. Our intelligence can spread into the world and things we use. 

I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It says that things we use, like tools, become part of our thinking. For example, when we use a stick, it becomes part of us. A blind person with a stick can feel the world through the stick. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. This shows that our mind can change and grow with new tools.

Our mind is always changing. From old stone tools to the internet, tools help us learn and understand the world. Humans use tools to know more. This is why humans make many things, and these things help shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity. Our minds change as we use different tools. MET helps us see how tools, from old to new, change how we think. Humans have used tools to change their minds since they first appeared.'"
82,"Photography is a very important invention. It changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of life. People used it for science, work, art, and fun. Many say photography is the best thing the US gave to art. 

Photography started in the mid-1800s. It was popular because it was a new technology. People liked new things like trains and electricity. Photography showed people the world in a new way. It was also a way for people to show who they were. Families used cameras to keep memories.

Photos look real. They show everyday life. A photo tells us to look at something. It is a record of what was in front of the camera. But, the person taking the photo also adds their own view. 

Photos can mean different things. We need to know why a photo was taken and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things at different times and places.

Artists use photos in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photos in his art. Today, photos are important in art. They help us understand the world."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American thinker and doctor, called psychology the ""science of mental life."" This means psychology is about how our minds work. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we have some idea of what this means. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is mostly about humans. James said human psychology has three main parts: thoughts and feelings, the world around us, and how we know about these things. 

Our understanding of the world is personal. It comes from our own thoughts and feelings. Sometimes, we think we know why people do things, like why they feel sad or quit their jobs. But people can see things differently. Psychology tries to find the best explanations for why things happen. It helps us know what is true and what is just our opinion.

Psychologists study the mind and brain, but they do not know everything about how the brain works. They learn a lot by watching how people behave. This is like solving a puzzle. They look at clues, measure things carefully, and use logic to understand what is happening inside us.

Psychology wants to describe, understand, and predict how people think and act. It helps in many areas, like teaching children to read better or helping people talk about their feelings. Psychology has been studied scientifically for about 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means thinking about their own thoughts, but this has limits. Today, psychologists prefer to watch how people behave to learn more."
84,"In a simple building in Michigan, USA, there is a special place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy, like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, thinks each product has a sad story because the people who made and sold them hoped they would be popular.

The museum started by accident. A man named Robert McMath wanted to collect new products as a 'reference library.' He began buying one of every new product he saw starting in the 1960s. He found out that most products do not succeed. So, his collection became mostly products that failed.

Many people like to think positively and believe things will go well. This is common in the 'self-help' area, where people are told to imagine good things happening. But research by Tali Sharot shows that people often think things will go better than they really do. Gabriele Oettingen found that thinking too much about success can make people less motivated to work hard.

Psychologist Carol Dweck says how we think about our abilities affects how we deal with failure. Some people think their ability is fixed and cannot change. They find failure very upsetting. Others believe they can improve with effort and see failure as a chance to learn and grow. This second way of thinking is like exercising muscles: you get stronger by pushing your limits. Dweck believes that thinking you can grow and improve is a happier way to live."
85,"Sports teams often play better at home. But why? People have different ideas. Sports are changing, and we are learning new things. Two important things are science and money. Scientists study why players do well at home. People with money want to know if home games are important. They think players should play well anywhere if they are paid enough.

Fans love to watch their team play at home. They think their cheering helps the team win. When fans cheer, they remember the times their team scores. They forget the times when nothing happens.

Scientists did a test with referees. Some referees watched a game with crowd noise, and some watched in silence. The referees with noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that crowd noise can affect referees.

Home advantage is not as strong as before. In the past, home teams won more often. Now, travel is easier, and stadiums are similar. But home advantage is still important in some sports. Basketball teams do well at home, but baseball teams do not.

Playing at home can make players feel more confident. In team sports like basketball, players work together better at home. Also, players have more energy at home games. This might be because they want to protect their home ground.

In some big games, home teams win even if they are not the favorites. They play with a lot of energy and do not give up. This is called home advantage."
86,"Text: ""â€˜The more I practise, the luckier I get,â€™ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous in sports. It means that practice makes you better. People argue about who first said it, but it is still popular. The saying is about practice and talent. Do we get talent from birth, or do we learn it? Many people think practice is more important. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said you need 10,000 hours of practice to be an expert. This idea is in many books, like Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. These books say practice is the most important thing. But writer Epstein says it is not always true. He looks at why some people are very good at what they do. He travels to many places to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that sled dogs need both drive and desire, which might be in their genes. This means that maybe our drive to practice is also in our genes. Epstein talks about nature (what we are born with) and nurture (what we learn). He says both are important for athletes. He thinks if Usain Bolt grew up in the US, he might have played basketball instead of running. Epstein also talks about race and gender in sports. He asks why men and women compete separately if practice is all that matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the best."""
87,"A new report says many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why kids today are so sad. In her book, ""Kith,"" she says it's because they stay inside too much, watching TV or using computers, and don't play outside in nature. She thinks this is a big problem. 

A study talked to kids and found they don't just want new gadgets; many want to play outside more. People over 40 remember their childhoods fondly, saying they had more freedom to play outside, which was healthier. But these adults now keep their own kids inside because they worry about safety.

Griffiths talks about how parents' fear helps toy companies sell more products to keep kids busy indoors. She also mentions how some kids are given medicine for being restless or have to wear goggles for games, which she thinks is silly.

Griffiths believes kids should have freedom to explore and take risks. She says kids need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones. But she doesn't explain how to make sure these accidents are safe. She also wonders if all kids want to be adventurous, as some might prefer staying home. The real problem might be forcing all kids to do the same thing, whether staying inside or going out."
88,"I am a scientist who studies how the brain works, and I have studied a lot in school. I am good at solving problems, but this is not because of school. Most problems in life need thinking and creativity, not just what we learn in school. For children, play is very important for learning. My research is about how play helps children grow. All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that need to learn more, play more. For example, animals that hunt play more than animals that eat plants. Children play more than any other young animals because they have a lot to learn. 

Play helps children learn important skills that school cannot teach. These skills include being creative, getting along with others, and controlling emotions. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can think of new ideas and solve new problems. Creative people often keep their playful minds as they grow up. Albert Einstein, a famous scientist, said school almost made him lose interest in math and science, but he found it again by playing with ideas.

We cannot teach creativity, but we can stop it by making school too strict. It is important for children to play with others to learn social skills and fairness. Play is something children choose to do, and they can stop if they want. This makes play fair for everyone. 

Today, school is harder, with less playtime and more homework. Adults control sports and playtimes, leaving less room for children to play freely. These changes happened slowly but are now very big. They are caused by parents' worries and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. 

Children need more play, not more school. We must let children play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for the future."
89,"In many countries, more young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them talk directly to employers. This is different from the past when people would stand outside offices with signs saying ""hire me."" But using social media can also lead to mistakes. 

For example, a young person in the US tried to connect with a marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts. The young person thought these contacts could help him get a job. But the executive was not happy. She did not want to share her contacts with someone she did not know. She sent a mean reply, which many people saw online. 

This story shows that using social media for jobs can be tricky. Many young people do not know how to use it correctly. Social media like Facebook and Twitter have been part of their lives for a long time. When they were teenagers, social media was fun and a place to try new things. But using it for work is different. 

Some young people are too confident when they talk to employers online. This can make them look arrogant. Employers do not like this. Young people need to be careful and polite when they contact someone for a job. 

To contact someone on a professional site, say who you are and what you can offer them. Do not send the same message to everyone. Be polite and humble. Social media can help you find jobs, but you must use it carefully."
90,"Text: 'It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, many UK newspapers have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think newspapers will disappear in 15 years. But old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here. Theatre, radio, and cinema have all survived new media like TV and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again. Newspapers were once new too. They became popular in the 19th century because of new technology like the steam press and telegraph. People started to want news regularly. In the past, people did not expect change. They only noticed big events like floods or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. Before that, people did not need news every day. Newspapers have a set format, but online news is different. Online, people can choose what news they want to read. News can be updated quickly, and there is no limit to how much can be written. But online news often focuses on being first and getting comments, not on understanding. In the past, news was shared in places like markets, where it was mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand the world better.'"
91,"Text: 'Humans are not like animals that see well at night. We need sunlight to see clearly. Our eyes are made for the day. This is why we use lights at night. We have changed the night by adding lots of lights. This is called light pollution. Light pollution happens when lights shine up into the sky instead of down to the ground. This makes the night too bright and affects animals and people. For example, birds can get confused by bright lights and fly into buildings. Some birds sing at night because of the lights. 

In the past, cities were not very bright at night. People used candles and lanterns. Now, cities are full of lights. This is not good for many animals that are active at night. Light is very strong and can attract animals. Birds and other animals can get trapped by bright lights. 

We need darkness to stay healthy. Our bodies work best with a regular pattern of day and night. Too much light at night can make us sick. It is important to have dark nights to see the stars and remember our place in the universe. Light pollution makes it hard to see the stars and understand how big the universe is.'"
92,"A big company said it will not count how many days off its workers take. This idea came from another company that did the same thing. The boss of the big company got the idea from an email from his daughter. The big company has 50,000 workers and does many different things like finance, transport, and healthcare. The other company is smaller with 2,000 workers and does one thing. 

The boss said workers can take as many days off as they want if they are sure their work is done and it won't hurt the company. But is this really possible? When you take a holiday, work piles up. This can make workers feel guilty and stressed, which is not good for work in the long run. 

In big companies, people often work late and might feel they can't take holidays. If there are no set holidays, workers might worry about looking lazy. They might not take the days off they need. 

With modern technology, people can get work messages anytime, which mixes work and free time. The smaller company started this policy because workers asked why they had to follow old rules about time off when work hours were not clear anymore. But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. 

Workers need time off for their health. Good feelings, creativity, and working well can happen without this new policy. So, it is not clear if letting workers take as much holiday as they want is really the goal or if it will work."
93,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This helps make sure the research is good and not wrong. It can take up to a year to review a paper. Some people think this is important to make sure the research is trustworthy, but others are not so sure. 

There is a new way called preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed. This helps share new research quickly so others can read and discuss it. Publishing in journals is often about becoming famous and helping careers, which can lead to problems. Sometimes, scientists leave out important data to get published in top journals. Reviewers also focus more on whether a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good science.

Preprints have been around for 20 years, but not everyone uses them. Some scientists worry that journals won't accept papers that were shared as preprints. Others fear that without peer review, bad science might be published. However, preprints allow everyone to see and discuss the research, which can be helpful.

Preprints also let scientists share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals. More people read and cite papers on preprint archives, showing they are useful for sharing research. Preprints focus on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,"Text: 'When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it is like a ""painting in words."" Their answers don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked them to choose an object and write about it in two ways. First, like a scientist, and second, as if the object is talking. They called the second part ""Poem."" One student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class see how poetry is different from anything else. The exercise was fun and led to good talks. When I was in school, poetry was hard for me. I thought poems were puzzles that stopped me from understanding. After school, many people read fewer poems. Sometimes, you see a poem and it dares you to read it. You might feel disappointed or confused. But you feel good for trying. What do we want from poems? Are they for deep feelings, beautiful images, or smart jokes? Maybe. But for tears, we watch movies. For information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings are nice to look at, and music is a mix of words and sounds. But poems can be unclear, like life. This doesn't tell us what a poem is. If you search online for ""poem,"" it says ""poetry"" is art with sound and rhythm. But the word ""poem"" comes from Greek, meaning ""a thing made."" Poets are ""makers of things."" So, what kind of thing is a poem? Some say poems are like wild animals or machines. But these ideas don't fully explain poems. Talking about poems helps us think differently. Poems can change how we see things. Like song lyrics, poems can stay in our minds. Words and music are powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. Words can be strong, like sticks and stones. A poem in a newspaper or magazine can stand out. It can touch us deeply, even though it is just words on paper. Poems take up space that could be used for longer articles or ads. Poems are written and rewritten, like stories or articles, but they are not made to sell. Publishers send out poetry books, but they don't expect to make money. A poem is not for the market; it is for itself. Because of this, a poem can still surprise us, even for a moment.'"
95,"I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost Â£70, which was a lot of money. My wife, Marion, was happy when I found a gold ring worth Â£80 on my first try. I like finding old things because it makes me feel connected to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 

One rainy February afternoon, I went to a place with old farming tools. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug in the mud and found a round, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, but it was a beautiful gold necklace called a torc. It looked like the famous Great Torc in the British Museum, from over 2,000 years ago.

I took the torc home and showed it to Marion. We didn't try it on because it was too precious. I hid it in our house because I was worried. The law says I had to tell the authorities about it in 14 days. I showed it to a friend in the hospital before taking it to the council office. The torc was real and sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. I got Â£350,000, which I shared with the field's owner.

Finding the torc was amazing, but I still enjoy looking for other things like brooches and coins. It's like fishing; you never stop because there might be something bigger tomorrow."
96,"Text: 'I love sleeping when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. My friends plan their trips with many activities like visiting museums and hiking. I smile and listen, but I don't say much. They might be surprised to know that I plan time for naps and lazy mornings on my trips. Sleeping better is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's YucatÃ¡n coast in my 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept, more than 12 hours a day. There were noisy birds, but I still slept well. Away from home, I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams. Without alarm clocks and work, sleep comes easily. I think sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break. When we travel, we see and hear new things. We take in new cultures, music, and places. We process all this when we sleep, so sleep feels more intense. Sleep changes in different places. People talk about jet lag, but I think adjusting to new places is more about local habits than time zones. In Trinidad, people wake up early, rest when it's hot, and become active in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me time to get used to their sleep pattern. When I do, I feel like I belong. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all took naps. I understood why they had many pillows. I joined them and experienced the siesta, a nap after lunch. It was a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Being in a new place, I enjoy the different smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. Slow travel means enjoying every moment, and sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should tell my friends that sleeping while traveling is an activity too.'"
97,"The woman looked away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I think this one looks best on you,"" she said kindly. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Everyone will wear a hat like that at my daughterâ€™s wedding. This small red and black hat will make me stand out."" She touched the little hat on her head. ""Yes, this is the one I want."" Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, Tattie. Mia's husband, Jeff, had asked, ""What kind of name is Tattie?"" Mia said, ""It's short for Tatiana. I think itâ€™s nice."" Jeff did not like fancy things and always spoke his mind. He would have told the woman in the shop that she chose the wrong hat. He often told Mia, ""You are too polite."" Later, Mia closed her shop and went home. Her shop was next to her house, so it only took forty seconds to get home. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia turned an old barn into her shop. Jeff was unsure if people wanted hats, but Mia knew they did. Her shop, Miaâ€™s Hats, was a success. Women came from far away to try on hats in her shop in Little Pelham. Mia also started selling handbags and jewelry."
98,"Lawrence Okoye is from London. He moved to Atlanta, USA. Lawrence is on a big sports journey. He was in the Olympic discus final. Now, he wants to play American football. Lawrence never played American football before. But he might join a big USA team. In Atlanta, he is learning his new position. Lawrence is 21 years old. It is surprising he might join a top team. Lawrence is good at surprising people. He was going to study law at Oxford University. But he chose to train for discus instead. In 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence went to Atlanta for discus training. He wanted to get ready for the world championships. He thought about American football before. But he decided to try it in the USA. He read about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he never played, he applied. Lawrence was not nervous. He believes in himself. He did well in tests and drills. Coaches liked him. Lawrence is happy but careful. He knows he has a lot to learn. Coaches say he has what it takes. He just needs to work hard. Lawrence is calm about the selection. He is not worried. He remembers the Olympic final. He came last, but he was happy to be there. Lawrence does not talk about it much. NFL players earn a lot of money. Lawrence changed from rugby to discus and now to American football. People ask why he does not focus on one sport. Lawrence says he is following his dream. If it does not work, he can go back to discus. He thinks carefully about his choices."
99,"We were flying east all night. When I woke up, it was already morning. I looked out the window and saw the land below. It was brown and green. It was mid-September, but there was no snow in Siberia yet. I saw no people, just mountains, streams, and forests. My neighbor woke up and smiled. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a Russian accent. His name was Sergei. He was from Moscow and sold safety clothes to miners. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. But with a dictionary, I told him I was going to Magadan in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to go back to England by bicycle. Sergei said, ""But, Robert, there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, with a friend named Al,"" I said. ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and said ""Holodna"" (cold) and pointed outside. I showed him with my hands that I had warm clothes. I did not tell him that I bought my clothes cheaply because I did not have much money. I was not sure if my clothes would be good enough. I had big over-trousers that I bought for Â£10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of tired students. The teacher was talking, and I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? I wrote a note to my friend Al. ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" Al was sitting in front of me. I gave him the note. He read it, thought, and wrote back. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I was a geography teacher. The job was hard but interesting. I had long holidays to go on adventures. Twice, I met Al during these holidays. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted more adventures. He decided to cycle around the world. This was his biggest challenge. Sometimes he thought the road would be too hard. But he was having a great adventure. He was doing something difficult every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots fly through tall poles. The poles are 15 to 25 meters high. The pilots make sharp turns and loops at very high speeds, up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to try it. 

Before the flight, I signed two forms. One form said I was healthy. The other form said I would empty my pockets. Small things can be dangerous in the plane. I learned to keep looking at the horizon. The pilot told me where to look. I also had to relax when flying upside down and enjoy the view.

Before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started moving, I tried not to touch the pedals or switches. I was nervous. To stay safe, I had to stay calm and focus. Panicking is not good.

The pilot, Dario, and I were in a fast plane. We took off and turned right quickly. It was very strong, and I felt the air push on me. I looked at the horizon and tried to breathe. We turned left and went down fast. My stomach felt strange. We flew close to the ground between two poles. It was very fast. 

For two minutes, I flew the plane. My hand was shaking. Then Dario did a barrel roll, a full turn. He asked if I was okay. I said yes, but I was not sure. Then he did a loop, a big circle in the air. Some people like this, but I thought it was too much. 

At the top of the loop, I heard a voice say, ""Relax, look up."" I saw fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was easier than what the pilots do in a race. After we landed, Dario ate sandwiches. I did not eat for hours. That night, I dreamed about the loop again and again."
101,"Doug Allan films animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature film, he probably filmed them. He likes it when the temperature is -18C. Allan studied marine biology and was a commercial diver. He loved diving and learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to make a wildlife film. He helped the crew and realized he wanted to be a wildlife cameraman. He liked travel, adventure, and filming underwater. Now, he is a top cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife shows. 

When he started, not many people had been to Antarctica. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. He became the ""cold man."" The camera technology was simple 35 years ago. It is easier to film today because of digital technology. Before, film was expensive, and you had to remember what you filmed. Now, you can film a lot and see it right away. 

Allan is good at filming in cold places. He feels comfortable on sea ice. He says there are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes in these places. Filming wildlife has successes and failures. Once, he went to the Orkneys to film birds but could not tell which birds they were. 

Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. It is a place with polar bears and is very cold, usually -32C in April. The wind is strong, and carrying cameras in the snow is hard. After 23 days, he saw only one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, he felt like he was living in the bear's world. He watched a hole in the snow and saw a bear come out. Then, two cubs appeared. It was like a show, and he had the best seat.

Now, Allan wants to make a film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to people who live there and see the changes. He thinks he can make a great documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies. He had to swim in very cold water and be careful of frostbite and polar bears. Eight months later, he also went to the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic for a new trip. This trip is very important. Pen and two friends will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice to see how thick it is. No one has done this before, and it will help scientists understand global warming.

Pen was ready for this job. When he was a child, a woman who worked for a famous explorer took care of him. She made him strong by sending him outside in cold weather with little clothing. His father loved cold adventures, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and the outdoors. She helps with his polar guide business. Mary says Pen is in more danger when he drives at home because he is always thinking about the Arctic. For fun, Mary once raced Pen in a mountain event. She finished an hour before him.

Pen and Mary have two children. Pen says it is hard to leave them. Last time, he told his son to take care of the family, but it was too much for him. This time, Pen will not talk to them much while he is away. He is getting ready for the trip and checking his equipment. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer, will go with him. A team of six will bring them supplies.

Pen is worried because he is almost 47 and has not trained enough. He thinks this trip is important because it will help scientists learn more about the Arctic. He says their skills are now very useful."
103,"I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being an Olympic athlete is amazing. I had time to write, work on TV, and talk to businesses and schools. These activities were fun, but I missed competition. I wanted to stay fit in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. That was good, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's question: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to my rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. If I joined, I would want to win. Would Ben help me win? Probably not. But being the underdog sounded fun. I contacted Ben. He was already planning to race and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. The race was now possible. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost Â£70,000. It was a lot of money. I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money after retiring from sports. People are interested in my story, but I wanted a new goal. Joining the race meant I could talk about something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. Being a full-time athlete was easier. Training for the Olympics was hard, but everything was organized. I worried people would think I just wanted to be on TV with Ben. But during our preparations, I realized the race was more about the mind than rowing. Ben had done tough challenges before, but he couldn't row well. I was surprised by this, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I should have known his skill level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"A year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the north of Finland. I was 26 and wanted a change from busy London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They let me work as a husky dog handler for the winter. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides with huskies. The company started with six dogs and now has more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm', which is simple and has no running water. They told me the work is hard and the hours are long, but I was excited to go.

November 6, London On my flight, I tried to learn the names of over 100 huskies, but I was nervous. I looked out the window and thought about winter coming.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus ride north was just what I wanted. We drove through snowy forests and saw reindeer. I arrived at the farm at night and was given boots to go outside. Anna asked if I was ready to start right away. I followed the barking dogs and saw people getting the huskies ready for sled rides. The dogs were very excited. I joined them and we went off into the dark with only a headlight.

November 15, Hetta I quickly learned how to be a husky guide. Anna asked if I was useful, and I realized I had a lot to learn. I had never driven a snowmobile or chopped wood. But I did have a driving license. I learned the basics of dog-sledding: lean in corners, use the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. Feeding the dogs was hard because water freezes quickly, so we made a hot meat soup for them. By the end of the first week, I was tired but happy. I emailed my friends, ""I can chop wood, hammer nails, and use a saw in the snow."""
105,"On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and finished the race. The news people were surprised by her amazing run. Her time was so good that she could compete with men in the world championships in Paris. Reporters asked her about emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman told her to use it after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she didn't really understand how big her achievement was at the time. She felt it was just what she was supposed to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits.

During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried she was running too fast and might not finish the race. Hartmann was angry about this but understood why someone might think it was risky.

With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast and still finished the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the end, she thought she could run even faster. The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would beat her time soon. Radcliffe thought she could do it again next year, but that didn't happen.

After the race, people wondered how she ran so well with her unusual style. Hartmann worked with her a lot, helping her with the pain from running 250-300 kilometers each week. He said she was very tough and could handle a lot of pain. Hartmann traveled from Ireland to France to help her, and she always wanted to start training right away. She worked very hard, and that made her great.

Radcliffe doesn't know why no one has beaten her record. She trained very hard, but she thinks others are more talented. She thought Mary Keitany might beat her record. Radcliffe says maybe people are racing each other instead of pushing themselves. She always pushed herself to do her best, even when she was winning.

That marathon was the best race of her career. She never ran that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" started, I didn't know if people would like it. At that time, many people were talking about a big change in food in Britain. I thought our show was new and different, but I was still worried. Would people like a show about cooking that also talked about history, memories, and science? I watched the first show feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to many other interesting projects, like a book about my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether it's about the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote more books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was real, with travel and meeting new people. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest book, where you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best pasta. These people have spent many years trying to make perfect food. Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish wasn't there. But after a long meeting, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on feelings, memories, and places. I knew the recipes wouldn't be the best ever, but I wanted to use my skills and knowledge to find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says perfection means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV series let me explore new foods, people, and places, which was very exciting. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. Some adventures included visiting a factory with the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that wasn't good enough to film. I also tried new cooking methods, like hand-milking a cow to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house while making pizza."
107,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and stopped in a field. John got out and looked at the engine. He didn't know what to do and started to laugh with Mum. Bea was worried and said, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was big with grass and flowers. I agreed with Bea because it was safe to be on her side. We got back in the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. John went to find someone who could fix the van. Mum lay on the grass and asked for a story. I told them about two birds I heard in London. They talked about food, other birds, and the weather. Bea said it was silly because no one understands birds. I felt sad because I thought I did. Mum fell asleep. John came back with three boys who helped push the van to a hotel. Bea stayed in the van, but the boys smiled and waved at her. We went to a cafÃ© near the road. John thought it was expensive, but Mum said we would just have tea. The tea was very sweet. We stayed there all day while John tried to fix the van. When it got dark, Mum made a bed for us outside. John said we needed to be towed to Marrakech. Later, we sat in a truck watching our van being pulled. Bea didn't want to move, so John carried her to the truck. I wondered how we would get home. I thought maybe we could take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel. She talked to two other pianists. One was a man from Tokyo, and the other was a woman from Europe. Lucy didn't hear the woman's name clearly. They were not in the competition like Lucy. They were older than Lucy, about ten years older. They spoke English well and talked about music and travel.

Lucy said, ""I think I'm going to Tanglewood this summer."" It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She didn't want to do many things, like concerts and competitions. These events made her miss a lot of school. She studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco instead. Lucy didn't even want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen young pianists from around the world were chosen, and she was one of them. Her dad bought her a necklace to celebrate, and her brother Gus dreamed of going to the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her to dinner to plan her music. Lucy didn't apply to the festival herself. Her mom did it for her. Her mom said, ""I didn't want you to be sad if you didn't get in."" Lucy thought her mom just didn't want her to say no.

The man from Tokyo asked, ""Tanglewood?"" Lucy said, ""Yeah."" He asked, ""How old are you?"" Lucy said, ""Fifteen."" The woman said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't want to brag. She just wanted to fit in. The woman left to talk to someone else. The man from Tokyo stayed and asked if Lucy had been to Japan. Lucy said she went once when she was eight.

Then, Lucy's grandfather came and took her to meet other people. He said, ""Don't get too friendly with the competition."" Lucy said, ""They're not the competition."" Her grandfather said, ""Everyone is the competition."" He made her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she didn't hear everything.

In the elevator, her grandfather said, ""You did well, Lucy. I'm proud of you. This is an important festival, and people know who you are."" Lucy liked being important, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. At school, being a pianist didn't make her special. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't care about her music skills. But at the festival, Lucy felt like she mattered."
109,"Dad said, ""It's not good to spend so much time online. You should go out more."" I wanted to know what experts think about this. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends and feel like they belong. They also learn important computer skills. Simon Miles, an expert, says social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers use it a lot, not just for quick things like adults do. It's not good or bad; it depends on how you use it.

Jim Matthews, who studies social media, says it's like when our parents went to youth clubs to talk and have fun. Social media helps teenagers find out who they are and learn to get along with others. Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says social media can help teenagers understand themselves better. They can share their favorite music or sports and see different opinions. People who use social media a lot are not as focused on themselves as those who don't.

Professor Andrew Phillips studies young people using social media. He thinks it helps quiet people with special interests find others like them. If you like a special kind of music and only a few people at school like it too, social media can help you find more friends who like the same thing.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers can find new interests online and create their own content. They make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers learn and share pictures. This can help them get jobs in the future because businesses use social media to sell things. If you have many friends on social media, they can be your customers.

Jim Matthews agrees that using social media creatively is good for future jobs. Working with others online to make and share things is an important skill today."
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a family vacation, they don't usually think of a long trip through nine states in the US and a part of Canada. But my parents wanted a different kind of vacation this year. My dad planned a big family trip. He said, ""Not enough people do this anymore."" My brother and I were not very excited. In June, we packed our car with bags and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was happy but knew I would miss my privacy for two weeks. We started our trip, leaving our big home for a small space in the car. We drove west through Oklahoma. We had some adventures, like almost getting caught in a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right to cross the road first! The next day, we woke up early and drove again. We saw deserts and mountains. We visited the Great Sand Dunes and Pagosa Springs in Colorado. The town smelled like sulfur, which was new for us. We learned that some roads are only for special cars like Jeeps. We saw many wind farms and went to Yellowstone National Park. We saw bears near the road, which was exciting. We stayed in an old hotel with no internet or phone service, but the views were amazing. After a rainstorm in Canada, we drove back home. My parents were right. We didn't need to go far to see amazing things. It was nice to be home, and I didn't fight with my brother during the trip! We took many photos to remember our journey. I will always remember the fun and unexpected moments.'"
111,"Rose Frost was 16 years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was going to be apart for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy would finish her last year of school and live at the college. She had a nice room with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would still check on Amy.

Rose was moving to her grandmother's house. She only remembered a little about her grandmother from holidays. She never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose's parents were not very happy, but Daisy wanted to know her granddaughter again. Rose did not know why her parents did not like her grandma, but they had a problem in the past. Rose was happy when she last saw her grandma.

Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy liked to meet people and go to events. Rose would get dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. Rose smiled at the thought. Daisy was not a typical old lady. She went to many social events.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was smart and mature. She knew about eating healthy, staying fit, and sleeping well. Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking every time. She did not want to be told about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood.

Rose's mother gave her a new phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to make good choices, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too strict. If there was a problem, they would talk about it.

Rose was not a wild child. Her school friends were like her, so her school reports and exam results were good. In five weeks, Rose would start a new school, meet new friends, and start her life again. It was her fourth school in five years, so she was used to it. This was her last time changing schools. For Rose, it was a new start in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher thought she might write a book one day. Charlotte thought writing a book was a big challenge. When she was 13, she decided to try. Now, her book is going to be published. She told her old teacher, who was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didnâ€™t want to wait because she thought she could be good at it.

Charlotte is 15 years old, and her book is very good. It has a strong story and lots of action. It doesnâ€™t seem like a teenager wrote it. A person from the book company is with us, but Charlotte doesnâ€™t need help. She is smart and confident but not too confident. Charlotte knows she is young and doesnâ€™t have all the answers. She wanted to ask big questions in her book, like about taking responsibility.

Charlotte thinks books for teenagers often show three types of teenagers: the outsider, the naÃ¯ve one, and the awkward one. She didnâ€™t like this because she thinks not all teenagers are like that. She believes teenagers can know who they are.

Charlotte likes reading fantasy books, but they almost stopped her from writing. She thought she had to write like them to be good. She learned from a book called How Not to Write a Novel that if readers can guess what happens next, the story is not exciting.

Charlotteâ€™s parents are journalists, and her dad knew someone in publishing. This helped her book get read. She knows she was lucky, but she also knows that writers need to be good to succeed. She doesnâ€™t take her success for granted."
113,"Text: ""â€˜Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,â€™ said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked down the ski slope. â€˜Now, who wants to go first?â€™ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had done some freestyle ski-jumping before, went first. He skied fast towards the jump and flew up, but something was wrong. We watched closely. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. â€˜Remember,â€™ Gareth said, â€˜speed can be tricky.â€™ Maybe I wasnâ€™t good at this freestyle skiing. On other ski holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I wasnâ€™t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes. I thought it looked fun, but I didnâ€™t know how to do it. My parents decided weâ€™d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing centre in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes. After practising inside, students went outside to try for real. â€˜Progress is sure!â€™ the centreâ€™s slogan said. â€˜Before places like this, new ski jumpers just went down the slopes and hoped for the best,â€™ said Gareth. â€˜But remember â€“ if you land on the flat part, youâ€™ll be in trouble.â€™ The â€˜knuckleâ€™ is the flat part before the slope goes down again. Land in the right place, and you keep moving. Land on the flat, and you stop suddenly, which hurts. Thatâ€™s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to go fast towards the jump. My legs wanted to stop, so I landed on the flat part. I didnâ€™t fall, but I felt tired. â€˜You need to control the jump,â€™ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought Iâ€™d hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some moves were like ski-jumping, others taught us to know what our body was doing in the air. Gareth talked to us. My â€˜aerial awarenessâ€™ needed work. I only knew what was happening before I jumped and then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. I had more problems before I landed right. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But it didnâ€™t last long. On the last run, I didnâ€™t slow down, jumped, and landed well. Then I saw my skis sliding down the slope without me."""
114,"Text: 'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at a fun park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster goes up slowly. It stops for a moment. Then, it drops fast, and you feel your stomach in the air. You go forward, left, and upside down very quickly. You feel scared and shout. But you wanted to go on the ride, like many other people. Amusement parks with exciting rides are very popular. Many people work to make these rides fun and safe. They are engineers and designers. Making a rollercoaster is hard. It must be fun and safe. It also needs to be new and exciting. Many ideas for rollercoasters were made by John Miller in the early 1900s. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts said it is about making people feel excited but safe. Rollercoasters need a good story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase. They also need to be the tallest or have the most twists. Professor Walker said that experience and testing are important. Jeff Hornick said you need to like thrills to make good rides. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said it can add to the ride, but the real rollercoaster is still the most important part.'"
115,"Miranda Ellington is 25 years old and works as a choreographer. She makes dances for many theatres and dance companies. Sometimes, she still dances too. She likes dancing because it reminds her of how it feels to be a dancer and listen to choreographers. This can be hard and stressful. As a choreographer, she teaches young students. She likes working with them because they are open to new ideas and want to succeed. They listen to feedback, even if it is tough. 

When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on dance steps and music. Sometimes she does not like the music, but she still tries to make a good dance. If dancers do not like the music, it can be hard, but she finds solutions. She cannot change the music because it is already chosen for big shows. She wishes she could try different music to make rehearsals more fun.

Miranda does not work with just one theatre or school. She likes meeting new people and learning different styles. This helps her not to get stuck doing the same thing all the time.

There was a documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda thinks it shows real life in a dance company. It shows how hard dancers work and how much they practice. 

Miranda believes a great dance show has good music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Everything should work well together. Sometimes, even if the dance is good, bad costumes can ruin it.

Miranda does not want to be known for just one type of dance. She wants to try many things and learn more."
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said you can see great things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to see and do? This talk gave me an idea for a fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, and it became the star of the film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and used old seatbelts to pull it. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it every night, even one night on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and cheered me on. I have walked a lot in the past, but this was new. It was the longest walk I have done, and it was on main roads. I could stop at a cafÃ© and relax on the sofa with a coffee instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. People often asked me, ""Are you doing this for charity or a marathon?"" I liked telling them, ""No, I just wanted to do it."" When someone at work asks about my weekend, I like to say I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"Text: 'When I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. At the Greek port, the man was surprised when I asked for one ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I told him I would join ten others to swim around the islands. He was still a bit confused, but he smiled and let me on the boat. Our group had sent emails before the trip, but we didn't have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides said a support boat would be with us, and they showed us how to talk to it. We did a short swim to divide into speed groups, then it was time for our first 1.5 km swim. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swam in a river, but never in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first swim, and I was happy when I did it by myself. The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to look at the scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and enjoyed them more. We didn't need the support boat much. I can't wait to come again next year.'"
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy. But since I started, I have traveled a lot, from the US to Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. This is a good job for a young person like me! 

When I was a child, I went to a school in another country, away from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers. Some said yes. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and find something new.

At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people. Many were accepted. They were smart and wanted to change jobs, like me. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and past work, not just that I loved to travel. I got the job!

I think this job is great for anyone. There are many good things about it, but free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard. We say, ""no-oneâ€™s finished till everyoneâ€™s finished."" It feels like a big family. Even if we donâ€™t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I donâ€™t have to think about work. If I have difficult passengers, which is not often, I know the flight will end soon, and I will not see them again!"
119,"Text: 'At the summer camp where I work, I like seeing the children do things they thought they couldn't do. Most children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel scared, but after we encourage them, they try and reach the top. This makes them feel happy. Some children miss home at the start of the week. It's not the very young ones who miss home the most â€“ it's the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we say they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's too late now, call tomorrow. Most children feel okay after a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time. Sometimes, it's not just the children who feel lonely. Parents often call a lot, asking how their child is doing, which is not needed. Often, the child is busy playing games or doing something else, so we tell the parents to call back later. We also see some children come in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something better for camp, but soon they understand why.'"
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show. The actors must also be good musicians. It started in London last year after five years in the USA. In the USA, it won â€˜Best Musicalâ€™ four times! In the UK, it was hard to find enough actors. This is because young actors in the UK can do fewer shows each week than in the USA. So, they needed more actors in the UK. But the director found many talented actors in the UK. They have just won their first â€˜Best Musicalâ€™ award in the UK. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA. It is full every night because people want to hear the songs. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, â€˜Itâ€™s great that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.â€™ Jamie said the young actors are busy. They have school lessons at the theatre every day. He likes the teacher but misses his old school friends. His whole class came to see the show. The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. His class loved the show, and it made Jamie feel good. His parents come when they can, but it is expensive for them. I told Jamie I also play guitar. He gave me a guitar, and we played a song together. I did not know the song, but Jamie helped me. I was happy when I played it right. Jamie is very good at playing, and I wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up. I was glad the director was not there to hear my mistakes! The young actors are already musicians. Some play many instruments, but they never played in a band before. They found it easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first played together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year. It is worth seeing.'"
