1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This made people think about the problems with sharing too much online. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with the world, offering chances for wealth and fame. So, we share our secrets, photos, and stories online. But later, we might find out that this can be risky and confusing.

However, there is hope. A group of early internet users, called bloggers, learned these lessons before social media existed. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with fame. We can learn from their experiences. In 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. He wrote about everything, and people were interested in his stories. But one day, he had to choose between his blog and his love life. He learned that sharing too much online can make people not trust you.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, who worked in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job, but someone at work shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. Armstrong stopped blogging for a while but later started again, writing about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger"" and earns money from her writing. She learned that just because we can say anything online, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Scientists usually agree with this idea because no one knows everything about the universe. However, some scientists were worried about the film and called it ""atrocious"" and ""dangerous."" This made people curious to watch it.

At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists talked about how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by happy people and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people found this evidence convincing, but many scientists did not.

The idea that water is affected by thoughts is amazing and could mean new forces are at work in the universe. But we need strong proof to believe it, and pictures of crystals are not enough. The real problem is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is expanding because of a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" These discoveries are based on years of research.

Other amazing discoveries are also being made. Neuroscientists found that our brain takes about half a second to process what we see, but we don't notice this delay. Anthropologists think they know where modern humans first lived and why they moved to other places. Some theorists believe there are links between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Science is not finished. We are still far from knowing everything. New ideas like chaos and quantum uncertainty show that we can't understand everything completely. Scientists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. Many people think the universe is best described with one word: incredible."
3,"I find writing novels difficult, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, and writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both are important to me. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind moves the leaves. In the garden, flowers bloom, and bees and butterflies come. This shows how seasons change. 

Since I started writing, I switch between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories. After finishing short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write both at the same time because they use different parts of my brain. 

I started with two short novels in 1975. Then, from 1984 to 1985, I began writing short stories. It was hard at first, but I enjoyed it. My world of stories grew bigger, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story book, Tales from Abroad. 

Writing short stories is nice because they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to make a short story good, but I can keep changing it. Writing a novel takes a year or two and is much harder. Short stories are a nice break for me. 

You can make a short story from a small idea, a word, or an image. It’s like jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. If a story doesn’t work, it’s okay. Not every story is great, even for famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. I learn from my mistakes and use them in my next story. 

When I write novels, I learn from my short stories. Short stories are like a test place for me. Without them, writing novels would be harder. My short stories are like soft shadows or small footprints I leave behind. I remember each one and how I felt when I wrote it. They are like signs to my heart, and I am happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,"Science is a big part of our lives. It can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. Science has made our lives easier, but it can also be dangerous. It tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the huge universe. Science is important, but sometimes people misunderstand it or think it is perfect when it is not.

Science is always changing. New ideas often replace old ones, even if people first laugh at them. Scientists sometimes feel jealous or angry, but their work is important. This book talks about big ideas in science that changed how we think. We will look at these ideas and see their beauty, but also remember that science has limits.

Science is not always right. Scientists often find new explanations that change what we know. Sometimes these changes are small, but sometimes they are big and change our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Later, scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein showed us new ways to understand the universe.

Science keeps moving forward. At the end of the 19th century, people thought there was nothing new to discover in physics. But then we found radioactivity, X-rays, and many other things. Now, some people think we might soon understand everything about the universe. Maybe this is true, maybe not.

Science is powerful. In the last 200 years, we have learned not just to watch nature but to change it. Sometimes we change things without understanding the effects. Science needs to be watched carefully. Everyone should know about science because it affects our future and the world our children will live in. Science is not just for scientists; it is important for everyone."
5,"Starting around 2015, big publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped growing or even went down. This made people question if ebooks would be important in the future. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, and his company lost faith in traditional books. Even though digital and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea makes us think and talk a lot. Why do we see ebooks and print books as fighting each other? This question is about more than just books; it shows how we feel about new things and changes. 

In my research, I found that people often think new technology will replace old ones. For example, when TV was invented, people thought radio would disappear, but radio survived by being used in cars and other places. The idea of books disappearing is not new. In 1894, people thought phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This has happened many times with movies, radio, TV, and smartphones. Some people thought losing books would be bad for culture, while others thought ebooks were much better. 

When new technology comes, like e-readers, it changes how we feel about things we use every day. We often feel close to things like books, TVs, and computers. So, when new technology appears, we miss the old things. This is why people still like old products and technologies. For example, when the printing press spread in Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. When movies got sound, people missed silent films. The same happened with photography and music records. E-readers made people appreciate the feel and smell of old books. 

This should comfort those worried about print books disappearing. But the idea of losing old media will always be interesting because it shows how technology changes us and how we resist change. We use stories to understand change, like stories of endings. The story of books disappearing shows our excitement for the future and our fear of losing what we know and love."
6,"For a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how famous people from the past 400 years did their best work. I wanted to know how they found time each day to be creative and productive. I looked at their daily lives, like when they slept, ate, and worked, to understand their habits and personalities.

The book I wrote is called ""Daily Rituals."" It talks about people's routines, which are the things they do every day. Routines can help us use our time and energy better. The psychologist William James said that having good habits can help us focus on important things. But he also had trouble sticking to a schedule.

I got the idea for this book one Sunday when I was supposed to be working on a story for a magazine. Instead, I was cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a morning person, so I work best in the early hours. That day, I started looking online for how other writers worked. I found many interesting stories and decided to collect them in a blog called ""Daily Routines."" This blog later became the book.

In the book, I included many different people's routines. I used quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. I also used information from biographies and articles. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section for anyone who wants to read more."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His father decided they could not go on holiday to Spain because of money problems. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. This made him want to become a palaeontologist. 

At university, Howard decided he wanted to study the very old times, not dinosaurs. He liked studying small, ancient creatures in rocks. After finishing his studies, he worried about finding a job. He knew he was good, but getting a job was not always fair. 

When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied. On the day of his interview, the professor who liked another candidate could not come. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, helped Howard get the job. Howard was happy to get the job, even though he later learned why he got it. 

Howard liked his job because he could plan his work. But life was not always easy. One day, someone stole his briefcase with important notes. He had to cancel a lecture. While having coffee, he met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils there. This was a big opportunity for him. 

Because of the theft, Howard changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he wanted to go to Nairobi to study the fossils. 

*An ammonite is a type of fossil."
8,"Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. At home, he even has ice cream made from bee larvae, which tastes a bit like nuts and flowers. Spence and his team are trying to make eating bugs more normal. They study how different things, like who we eat with or the color of our plates, change how food tastes. 

Spence wrote a book called ""The Perfect Meal"" with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman. It has many interesting facts about eating. For example, the first person to order food in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most. Also, we eat more when we are with other people.

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple, with old equipment. This helps him work with chefs who can't pay for research. His work is often paid for by big food companies. These companies want to reduce salt and sugar in their products without people noticing. They do it slowly so customers don't taste the change.

Spence also works with famous chefs like Heston Blumenthal. Together, they created a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"" that uses sound to change how food tastes. Spence found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. Some airlines and food brands are using his research to match music with food.

At home, Spence has fun dinner parties. Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colored lights and sounds to see how it changed the taste of drinks. For Spence, home and work are closely connected."
9,"Our brains are working harder than ever before. We get a lot of information, some true and some not, and we have to decide what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing more things by ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in shops. Now, we do these things on our own. We try to manage our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and TV shows, and our smartphones help us do this. But there is a problem. We think we are doing many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly between tasks, which is not efficient. Multitasking can make us stressed and confused. It makes our brains want more new things to focus on, which distracts us. The part of the brain that helps us focus is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask can make us perform worse. Glenn Wilson, a psychology professor, found that trying to focus on a task while having an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. Multitasking can be worse than being tired. Russ Poldrack, a scientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to a part of the brain that stores skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to a part of the brain that organizes it better. Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to answer a text or not. Making many small decisions can make us tired and lead to bad decisions. Many people, like business leaders and scientists, say email is a big problem. It is not the email itself, but the large amount of communication. A colleague's son said his father just answers emails all day, which is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and finish other tasks."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think these questions were important. Scientists studied animal behavior and the results, but they did not think animals had feelings or thoughts. Recently, this has changed a bit. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals might have emotions. This idea is now in some popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? In an experiment with cows, those that opened a gate to get food were happier than those that had help. If cows like solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? Some people, like Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, think we should stop eating meat. He believes this is a big change in how we think about ethics, like when slavery ended. Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He says animals have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. These experts may never agree because the main issue is philosophical, not just scientific or moral. It is hard to define consciousness, so can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an experiment with starlings, a type of bird, that he thinks shows they can feel depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were put in two groups. One group had nice cages, and the other had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid bad worms from another. Later, when only bad worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages ate them. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt pessimistic. Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, believes we will one day see animals like we see racism now. He says we cannot support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger. If he was the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning wrote a book about animal behavior. He says ideas about animals change over time. In the early 1900s, people thought animals thought like humans, but then they changed their minds. Now, the idea is changing again. It is a difficult topic, and people have strong opinions."
11,"Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear better. Adrian West, a research director, says that people think arguments help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve problems and make it harder to think deeply. We see a lot of poor thinking and opinions, which can confuse us. More data does not always mean more knowledge or better decisions. Reading books has decreased, and some people, like Patricia Greenfield, think this affects critical thinking. She says we focus more on quick media and doing many things at once instead of concentrating on one thing. We don't know exactly how technology affects thinking, but it changes how we think. Computers and the internet can be good or bad for thinking, depending on how we use them. Reading helps us think and imagine, but visual media like video games and TV do not. However, visual media can improve some skills. Many young people do not use their full potential because of this. How we see technology affects how we think about critical thinking. Video games are often seen as bad for kids, but James Paul Gee says they can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and thinking skills. In the digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects thinking."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He wrote a book about how working with your hands is good. His new book talks about how to live in the modern world. He got the idea when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. He thinks these ads make it hard for us to focus on what we want to think about. 

Crawford says that because of these distractions, we find it hard to think or remember things. We also avoid talking to strangers because we don't want to be interrupted. He believes that things like video games and phone apps take over our attention. Many people feel the same way. For example, some people complain about emails but still check them all the time. Studies show that just seeing a phone on the table can distract us.

Crawford thinks technology makes us focus too much on ourselves. We often choose to send a text instead of talking to a friend. This can make us lose real connections with people. He gives an example of a gym where people used to share music, but now everyone listens to their own music with earphones. This change makes the gym less social.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. Second, we should do activities that make us focus on real things, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us connect with the world and other people. They also help us pay better attention to what is important."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often talk about our jobs. But when you are a philosopher, like me, it is a bit harder to answer. Saying you are a philosopher can sound like you think you are special or know more than others. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But people often think philosophers are different. 

One reason is that philosophers think about life and ideas. A long time ago, a Greek philosopher named Aristotle said that thinking about life is the best way to live. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that we should think about our lives and not just follow what everyone else does. This helps us make our own choices. 

Thinking about life does not mean you have to read many books or think deeply all the time. It means looking at your daily life and making sure it is good for you. It is practical and should be shared with others because it helps us live better lives.

Another reason people think philosophers are different is that academic philosophy has become very specialized. Philosophers often write for other experts, not for everyone. This makes it hard for people to understand what philosophers do. 

I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I study ethics, which is about deciding if actions are right or wrong. But ethics is more than just following rules. It also looks at how we think about responsibility and our attitudes. Philosophy helps us look closely at our actions and beliefs. By doing this, we can learn more about ourselves and help everyone."""
14,"Text: People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. In the past, philosophers talked about food to explain other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, they seemed to talk about food, but they were really discussing other things. 

An interesting example is the Greek philosopher Epicurus. He talked about enjoying life and avoiding pain in many ways. But today, people think of him as someone who loved eating and drinking. His name is used in restaurant names and food websites because it makes them sound special.

Food is very social and cultural. It comes from history and is shared with people around us. We eat with others and get our food from farms and stores. We deal with food more than any other thing, so it is a good topic to think about deeply.

When food is ready, people talk and write about it. Some say food critics are not special; they just describe food well. Most studies on how we sense things focus on sight, not taste, and this should change.

Food also has an artistic side. We say paintings and music are beautiful, but not food. Some think food should be part of art discussions, like sculpture or poetry. But food is eaten and gone, unlike art that lasts, so some say food cannot be true art.

There are many ethical questions about food. What should we eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-GMO? Our choices show our beliefs, and philosophers ask why we choose what we do.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a duty to their guests because of love and friendship. Everyone is welcome in a home kitchen. Professional cooks have duties to their boss and the food, so only trained people work in their kitchens.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ talks about how food can help connect different cultures. We can learn about others by enjoying their food and eating together, which has been important in international relations. The essay uses fun stories to explain this idea to readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, makes special board games called 'legacy' games. He thought the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. So, he wondered if board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices in one game affect the next game? He changed a classic game called Risk to make Risk Legacy. In this game, choices you make can change the game forever. You might have to tear up cards or change the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players remember past actions. Daviau said, ‘You can point to the board and say: “You did this!”’

Daviau also helped make a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to stop diseases. His next game was SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very popular, SeaFall was a big test for legacy games because it was a new idea. In SeaFall, set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players explore new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said it takes a lot of time. Sometimes the game works well at first, but then it breaks, and they have to fix it.

Legacy games were not expected to be very popular. Daviau thought only a few people would like them. He said, ‘I thought I would be known as the guy who did this weird project.’ But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it is a big change in game design. ‘It’s exciting to learn a new game or way to play,’ he said. Ben Hogg, another fan, liked the adventure in legacy games. He said, ‘You’re buying into an experience. It’s like the stories in video games.’

The legacy format is like video games and TV shows with episodes. Daviau wanted to write for TV but ended up in game design. He likes telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock says making a legacy game is like writing a book. ‘You need to know how it starts and ends,’ he said. Daviau is happy to see others use his idea but thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, thinks legacy games change how we see board games."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online and seemed like something from a children's movie. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think animals are like humans. Octopuses are very smart, even though they look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells for protection, and even play in a smart way.

Some people think it's not scientific to say animals are like humans. But Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, says it's wrong to ignore the human-like traits of animals. He calls this ""anthropodenial."" He says animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.

In the past, people thought animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, who created the theory of evolution, said the difference between humans and animals is not big. In the 20th century, people started to see animals as machines that just respond to things. They thought animals didn't have feelings or thoughts. This view came at a time when humans were destroying animal habitats and not caring for animal welfare.

Now, de Waal believes we are starting to understand animal intelligence better. He says we are learning a lot about animals, thanks to the internet. The best tests for animal intelligence consider what each animal is good at. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide nuts, even if they might not do well on human memory tests.

In her book, ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery says if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might ask how many color patterns we can make on our skin. We would fail that test, and the octopus might think we are not smart.

De Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean. But he knows that stories like Inky's help people appreciate how smart animals are. He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got upset because grapes are better. A video of this experiment convinced many people that animals can feel envy. This shows how powerful stories and videos can be in changing our minds about animals."
17,"Robots were once just in science fiction stories, but now they are becoming very important in our world. They are changing how we work, just like machines did during the industrial revolution. For many years, robots have been used in car factories and other industries. Now, experts say robots will soon be used in many more areas, and many countries are not ready for this big change.

Most people think robots will do most of the work humans do in the next 50 years. But, many also believe their own jobs will still be around. This is not true. Robots will change every job sector in the next few years. For example, an Australian company made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This is much faster than two people can do in a day. In San Francisco, a robot named Tally helps in supermarkets by checking if products are on the shelves and priced correctly.

People who support robots say they will create new jobs for people who can fix and program them. But, some people worry that robots will take away the need for human skills. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots will change jobs. He says that soon, robots will be smarter and work well with humans. Many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will make new rules about robots.

In five years, salaries in the robotics field will go up, but many jobs will not be filled because there are not enough skilled workers. Dr. Zhang says people need to learn new skills to keep up with technology. We cannot expect to do the same job forever.

New robots will also be made for homes and personal use. These robots will be more advanced and interact with us in new ways. This is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future. Countries need more people studying science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive."
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountain climber, once said he wanted to climb Mount Everest ""because it’s there."" People often wonder why anyone would do something so dangerous. Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams. It shows that climbing can be about adventure and fun. 

In 1967, a writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay about climbing. He said there are seven different types of climbing, each with its own rules. For example, some climbs use a lot of equipment, while others use very little. This idea has become very popular among climbers.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom they get from climbing. But climbing can also be difficult and limiting, like when a storm keeps you stuck in a tent. This is a bit of a puzzle, but some say that having fewer choices makes life simpler and more free.

Joe Fitschen, a rock climber, thinks we should ask ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is in our genes. We like to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it's risky. This might be more about our biology than about thinking it through.

Brian Treanor, a US academic, says climbing can help us develop important qualities like courage and respect for nature. He thinks these are important in today's world, where people often avoid risks.

Some climbers believe that climbing without help from others or technology is more challenging and deserves more recognition. Ebert and Robinson, two expert climbers, said that climbing alone or without extra help is harder and should be respected more. But this idea can be dangerous if it encourages people to take unnecessary risks.

Climbing can also be about being in the moment and focusing on the task. Some people say climbing is like Zen philosophy, which helps train the mind to find peace. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,"Alfred Brendel was a famous pianist for over 60 years. He was very serious and focused on playing European piano music. He wrote and played a lot but did not teach much. People who knew him well saw he could be fun, but he was serious during concerts. He spent a lot of time studying, traveling, and performing.

A few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not want to teach him because he had not taught many students before. He thought it was like asking a mountain guide to teach a child to walk. But Kit, who was about 14, played the piano very well. Brendel listened to him and was impressed. Kit played beautifully, and Brendel decided to teach him.

Now, Kit is 19 and is becoming known in the music world. Brendel is careful to make sure Kit does not get too tired or stressed. Kit is very active and likes to learn new things, like languages and math. He also writes music and plays tennis, with his mother always watching over him.

Brendel says it is important to write music to understand it better. Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. He listens carefully to Brendel and can do what he is told. Brendel is careful not to say Kit will be a great pianist too soon because it can be harmful if people expect too much.

Brendel is now 80 years old and does not perform anymore. He says he did not want to be famous quickly but wanted to achieve certain things by the age of 50. He feels he has done many of those things and is happy with his life now, even though he does not play the piano anymore."
20,"When I was a child, I thought gardens were always beautiful places. My Grandad’s garden was not in a dirty city. It was next to a river and went down gently to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a place to escape and find peace. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows, with plastic covering broken glass.

At home, my father was often quiet. He wasn’t boring, though. He liked funny things and had favorite phrases like ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ which means ‘I don’t mind.’ He probably wished he had done more with his life. He left school without finishing and learned to be a plumber. He didn’t love plumbing; it was just his job. He wasn’t very ambitious, but once he and Mum thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was good at fixing things at home, like making bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents moved house only once. But my mother liked to change furniture often. The biggest change was when we got a piano. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and took them away. I never got to play the piano. My sister had lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn’t get lessons, she said, ‘You’d never have practised.’

I liked going to the river. I could imagine being in another world. I would take a fishing net and wear old sandals. I’d walk along the river, find a spot, take off my sandals, and look for fish to catch with my net. After trying to keep them alive at home, I put them back in the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as I could, but it didn’t seem possible. Then one day, my father said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.’ My dad usually didn’t like gardening, but he saw that I loved it. I think he hoped it would be good for me. Even if he didn’t like gardening, he saw my passion for it."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. The strong wind from the Atlantic Ocean is very powerful. It feels like it could blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. Lawrence's sheepdog, Tie, comes to us, and Lawrence pets him gently. The wind is loud, but Lawrence is comfortable here on his island. He is showing me around. He points to the north and shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see rain falling on Rum's big mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay,’ he says. Suddenly, Lawrence says he needs to move his sheep because rain is coming. We walk down the hill, and he tells me about the island. Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide. The geese eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. We stop talking to move the sheep. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to gather the sheep but is not doing well. Lawrence tells Tie to go to the right, but Tie goes straight, causing confusion. Lawrence is disappointed and says, ‘That will never do.’ The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son, Colin, manages the cottages, and their daughter, Mary, runs the island hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail boats in the summer. ‘They go out and come back when they’re hungry,’ Mary says. But living on the island has challenges. Electricity is only available sometimes. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, Mary makes breakfast using a flashlight. I get used to it, even without mobile phone service. Mary tells me, ‘There is mobile reception on the hill. Most people last a couple of days, then put the phone away.’ So I do the same. Life on Muck is surprising. Today, a boat brings groceries and three musicians. They play music in the island’s tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, by the fire, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. Her father bought a farm on the Isle of Soay without seeing it. Jenny was sent to manage it, even though she only had typing skills. I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. I eat well because almost all the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to get fresh fish from Sandy Mathers, a fisherman. I bring it back to Mary, and by 7 pm, we have a delicious fish dinner. The next morning, I am supposed to take a ferry to another island. But many ferries have been canceled because of high waves. If my ferry doesn’t come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. Secretly, I hope to stay longer, even without a phone."
22,"The game design industry used to be mostly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people. But now, the video games industry is taken seriously. Making video games is not easy. When a new movie comes out, video games based on it need many team members and months of hard work. Like many industries, it is hard to get into, but it is growing.

Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is hard to make progress in big companies or to have a say in big games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just the people who lead the whole game, but also those who design parts of it. How can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim thinks differently. He says the only way is to make games. You need to create something to get a job. Game design is more than a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, you have to do it to make it real.

Another expert, John Field, says there are other ways. Many people want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs. Even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and business ability to help the industry grow. Can you do it alone? John says it is tricky, but a good course in games can help. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all kinds of entertainment and arts. They might have worked for a few years after finishing school and then decided that games are their passion. They are not just fans; they are excited about the future of games and know how diverse games can be. Connections can also help. To succeed in games, you need to network.

The idea of a young boy always playing games is outdated. Now, games are seen as a grown-up activity. Families play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. Games are popular with large audiences and are a great way to learn. He sees many new possibilities and opportunities in this big area."
23,"Since I was a child, I always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy. He always told my friend what he couldn't do. My friend stopped wanting to play football because of this. I am happy my dad was not like that. 

When I score a great goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but it's not. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. You need to practice a lot to score amazing goals. The best players in the world practice for many years, even if they have natural talent. 

Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned technique. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning skills. At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know education is important, but back then, I only thought about football. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't notice it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, but he is too young to sit still. He likes to kick the books around, like me.

At the start of my professional football career, the manager helped young players like me join the first team. He didn't make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A TV presenter said, ""You can't win anything with kids."" This made us realize we had a lot to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.

I rely on my close friends and family a lot. Having a lot of money can cause problems. People say, ""I can't believe you let your mother keep working."" I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would not like to be on my payroll. My mum is a hairdresser and loves her job. I like to use my money to help people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. Money doesn't solve everything.

After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off to do things I couldn't do before. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't ski now because if I break a leg, I can't play football, and I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter helped us find a place to live at Reef Point. Sam was my dad's agent in Los Angeles. My dad couldn't write anything good in Los Angeles, so Sam found us a cheap place to live. Reef Point was quiet in the summer because the sun was often hidden by sea fogs. Not many people visited because the road was not nice, and a nicer place, La Carmella, was nearby. Only people with little money or those who loved surfing came to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, many people came, and it became busy. My dad was busy writing a script and was in a bad mood. I spent most days on the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We didn't have a dog when we moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I gave him water, and my dad pretended to be angry but wasn't really. Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found, like shoes or towels, which I had to return to their owners. He also liked to swim with me, even though I was faster. One day, after swimming, we watched surfers. One surfer was very good and came to talk to me. She asked why I didn't surf, and I said I didn't have a board or money. She realized I was British and asked about my dad. When I said his name, Rufus Marsh, she recognized his book, ""Tall as the Morning,"" and became more interested in talking to me."
25,"Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on the ship called the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this advice was wrong. An announcement said there was a problem with the computer system, and the passengers were getting upset. They had paid a lot of money for this trip and wanted it to be special. Violet felt like leaving. She looked for her phone in her bag but couldn't find it. This made her feel even worse about the trip. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left her phone there because all her numbers were in the phone. Her son Harry always told her to be careful about this. 

Violet asked a friendly couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at home. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her was relieved, but she didn't tell Harry. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother. Her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding because he was forgetful too. 

Finally, the line started moving, and Violet gave her travel documents to go on the ship. She felt disappointed when she saw the ship's foyer. It looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy, with fake wood, shiny chandeliers, and airport-style carpets. She followed signs to the elevators, which were full of tired passengers. Violet was squished in the elevator until she reached the twelfth floor. She was happy to find her room had the balcony she wanted. She had paid extra to make sure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he didn't know he was starting a journey into the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Maier, a street photographer who took amazing pictures. Now, Maloof has a big collection of Maier’s work. In his home, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, 100,000 negatives, and many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked at all of it and realized he found something special by accident. ‘When I bought this, I didn’t know what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I could have sold it all to someone else.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she went back to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always had a camera with her. She wore big coats, wide hats, and strong shoes. ‘On her day off, she would leave with her camera and come back late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. She wasn’t very social, but she liked to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, sometimes recording them on audiotape. She loved taking pictures of the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and did what she wanted,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anything stop her.’ Maier’s work was pure art; she didn’t do it for money. Her photos often show women, children, old people, and the poor. ‘Vivian’s pictures are very interesting,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of other photographers in her work and wonders if she created her own style. ‘Was Vivian very skilled or did she copy others?’ Maloof wonders if he will ever look at all the negatives, which he keeps in three big, fireproof cabinets. The funny thing is, he wasn’t interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I saw that people and street scenes were important to her,’ he said. ‘There was more to her work than I thought. Now, we want to make her famous. We want Vivian Maier to be in history books.’"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a funny story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her book, and the officer asked, ""What's it about?"" This is a hard question for a writer. 

The Luminaries is set in New Zealand in the 1860s. There are some crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complicated. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a history book, but she found the past made the story more interesting. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked her how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it feels nice because people in her small country feel proud of her success. She also said it is annoying when people think her book is not serious. 

Catton had an idea to write the book like a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. The book gets faster as it goes. I asked if it matters if readers notice this. She said she wanted to make a book with patterns that don't matter, but if you care, you can see them. Even with its unusual structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery. Surprisingly, she didn't plan the whole story before writing. She liked to write herself into difficult situations and then find a way out. She also wanted the book to be fun for readers. 

We talked about her love for TV drama series. The Luminaries has cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she would like to write for TV. She said, ""That could be pretty cool."" She was very enthusiastic and laughed often. She loves talking about her work and New Zealand. She notices how her imagination changes when she is in different places. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busy cities. But for now, she will stay in New Zealand. Many people hope it inspires her to write more books."
28,"Jonny Kinkead loved making things and playing the guitar when he was a boy. For the last forty years, he has been building guitars by hand. He says, ""I still love the guitar. It's amazing how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound. Using different types of wood makes different sounds, and that still amazes me.""

Jonny learned to play his brother's guitar at age eleven. At sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. Instead of buying one, he decided to make it himself. He studied guitars to understand how different shapes and woods change the sound. The bass guitar was the first instrument he made from scratch, but he and his brothers had already been making model boats and planes. His father taught them how to use tools.

Jonny's bass guitar was good, but he didn't think about making guitars as a job. He liked painting and sculpture too. After school, he studied architecture at university because he liked design. But he left the course halfway through because he wanted to do something more creative. He realized that making guitars is like sculpture because it involves shaping sound. He thought it was a practical way to make art because people use guitars.

Jonny has been making guitars for a living ever since. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows to earn money. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of the materials. As he became known as a good guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, he only makes about ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings.

In the beginning, Jonny worked hard to get noticed. He went to music festivals and asked musicians to try his guitars and tell others about him. He also learned how to price his guitars, which was difficult for him.

Jonny thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. When he started, people thought only American guitars were good. But now, UK-made guitars are respected. Jonny says new guitar-makers should take courses to learn important skills. However, he believes learning by trying different things is also important. He says, ""Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn't, and try new things. If you learn from someone else, you only learn one way. If you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything."""
29,"When English people talk, they often start by talking about the weather. This is a tradition. A famous writer from the 18th century, Dr. Johnson, said that when two English people meet, they first talk about the weather. This is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they are very interested in it. But this is not true. 

Some writers, like Bill Bryson, say the English weather is not exciting. There are no big storms or dangerous weather like in other places. Another writer, Jeremy Paxman, says the English weather is interesting because it is always changing. You never know what the weather will be like.

However, the real reason English people talk about the weather is different. Talking about the weather is a way for English people to start a conversation. It helps them talk to each other. When someone says, ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" they are not really asking about the weather. These are just ways to say hello or start talking.

There are three main times when English people talk about the weather: 
1. As a greeting.
2. To start a conversation.
3. When there is nothing else to talk about.

Because of this, it seems like English people talk about the weather a lot. But really, they use it to help them talk to each other."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to tell her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built, but Alice felt her answers were not good enough. She couldn't find a good historical novel to help explain life at the Wall in Roman times, so she decided to write one herself. 

After teaching for 31 years, Alice retired and started writing in 2001. She felt it was a big change. Teaching was like acting, with a performance every day, and it was very tiring. Writing was exciting but not as exhausting. Her old teaching friends were jealous because she still connected with children through her books. Alice wanted her books to fill a gap in children's fiction. She thought many books for teenagers were about negative experiences or total fantasy like Harry Potter. Her books were different.

Alice liked to teach English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy. She loved seeing children go from being bored to interested and from not understanding to understanding. She saw her writing as a way to keep teaching. She started writing her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. She didn’t want to spend her summer on a course she thought she didn’t need.

Before the course, she had to send her best piece of fiction. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. After three hours and 30 pages, she sent it and was accepted. During the course, other students liked her story and suggested she publish it. With only school report cards as proof of her writing, she asked for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, who is a critic and editor, helped her a lot. He read her chapters, changed sentences, and suggested new words. Alice’s mother-in-law thought they were rival authors, but Alice felt they worked well together."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. The race was between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

Jonny was excited about the race. He said, ""I’ve never done anything like this before. It’s exciting! The roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold now, so I’ll be warm in the car."" Alistair was also excited. He wore full winter cycling clothes, while Jonny wore jeans and a sweatshirt. Alistair joked, ""I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he’ll make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Fleet Moss, the highest road in Yorkshire, 350 meters up. The car might have an easy time, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill at the start. After a quick handshake, the race began. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside, while Jonny drove on the road. They would see each other again at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s confidence dropped quickly. Just 15 seconds into the drive, a big tractor blocked the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he said to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!"" After the tractor moved, Jonny continued driving. Alistair struggled with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. The ground was open, and the sun came out. Alistair started to go faster.

In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The roads in Yorkshire are very old and narrow. Jonny had to drive slowly around tight corners and through a stream on the road. After the last village, the road was straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. Jonny sped towards Fleet Moss, while Alistair rode across his last field and onto the road from the other side. Alistair reached the finish line first. He asked the crowd, ""Is he here?"" When they said no, he raised his arms and said, ""Yes!"" A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. ""Well done,"" Jonny said sadly. ""I’m disappointed."""
32,"Text: 'When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the first thing you notice is the silence. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass. You throw it up to serve and hit it, hearing the sound of your own shot. The grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the quiet crowd make you feel like you are in a different world. The silence helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to think only about the game and the point I am playing. When a point ends, the silence breaks with applause and cheers. I hear them, but they feel far away. I don’t think about the 15,000 people watching me or the millions around the world. I am very focused as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, always told me it was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I would play there and win. Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer twice, in the finals the two years before. Losing in 2006 was not so bad. I was happy to be there at age 20. Federer beat me easily because I didn’t believe in myself enough. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have done better. It wasn’t my skills that failed, but my mind. I cried a lot after that loss. Losing is always painful, but it’s worse when you know you had a chance. My uncle Toni, who is a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me. He even criticizes me when I win. But after that loss, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I told him he didn’t understand, that it might have been my last chance. I know a professional athlete’s career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I missed a big one in 2007. Toni couldn’t make me feel better, but he was right. I got another chance in 2008. I was sure I learned from my loss the year before. I believed I would win. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends. We didn’t talk about the match. They knew I was already thinking about it in my mind. Until the match started, I needed to keep that space in my head for myself.'"
33,"A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in April 1957. She loved Africa and wrote to her family saying, ""I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became well-known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made Jane famous by showing her work with chimpanzees in articles and TV shows. She also wrote books for children and adults, including a bestseller called ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century, like Marie Curie. Many stories about her life focus on her adventures and dreams, but they sometimes miss her real achievements. Jane's work helped us understand chimpanzees better. Before her, people did not know that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. She showed that chimpanzees have emotions and social systems like humans. 

Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is very important for chimpanzee research. Her study of chimpanzees in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered a great scientific achievement. Jane changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves because chimpanzees are our closest relatives.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of becoming a scientist. When she was five years old, she disappeared one day. Her family and the police looked for her. Later, she came back with straw in her hair. She explained that she wanted to see how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours to watch. This curiosity was the start of her career as a biologist."
34,"Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist. This means she uses her voice to play different characters. In one conversation, she spoke like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. People know her voices from children's TV shows, cartoons, and health and safety videos. She recently did a voiceover about back injuries and had to learn medical words quickly.

Shirley explains that doing voiceovers is more than just making funny voices. You have to make the script interesting for people who can't see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they often don't get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.

After school, Shirley took a drama course to become an actress. She also sang jingles for TV ads. One day, someone asked her to try out for a rabbit character in a cartoon. She thought it was funny but tried it anyway and got a big part. She realized she was good at voices and decided to focus on voiceover work. In her second film, she played the main character and her brother and mother.

Adult women often do voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter. Hiring child actors is complicated, so companies prefer adults. Shirley learns new voices by watching children's TV. She enjoys doing cartoons the most, but she also does educational videos and ads for things like vacuum cleaners. She says it's hard to sound excited about things she doesn't care about, but smiling while talking helps make her voice sound happy.

The competition for voiceover work is tough. A good showreel, which is a recording of what you can do, is very important. Shirley says it's worth investing in a strong showreel. She got to the top of her profession by working hard and not giving up. She suggests going to workshops to learn about voiceovers. Shirley loves voices and sometimes keeps speaking in a character's voice even after leaving the studio. Her children are used to her talking in different voices."
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because being a cartoonist is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people stop dreaming about these jobs and think about more realistic ones, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make money by drawing doodles like the ones in school notebooks. But some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. 

For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school papers, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college. After college, I showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to live on.

To be a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree, much money, or even to be great at drawing. You need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. It’s a hard job, and you should only try it if you can’t imagine doing anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and gives you time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t say no to work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about everything.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But now, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to make and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than those who are very artistic but not good at business.

I often meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they won’t show their work to anyone! To protect your work, you just need to draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it’s not a disaster – it can actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and getting rid of things I didn't need. I decided to throw away an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a black guitar made in Japan. I usually don't like to throw things away, so why did I want to throw this guitar away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, ""Are you really going to throw that away?"" I said yes, but I already felt a little sad. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways. 

For years, I felt sad about what I did. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that surprised me. It was from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes and sells guitars. He said, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address sticker on the back of the guitar. He used my name to find me online and contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He offered to sell the guitar back to me. I was so happy I almost cried. Keith's price was fair, and I was glad my dad put those stickers on everything I owned, even my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this story!

My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s because it was popular then. I liked the sound of the classical guitar because it was calm and gentle. But I didn't get very good at it, so I switched to the electric guitar. At that time, punk music was popular, and you didn't have to play well to be a rock star. When I got my old guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. The guitar felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I picked it up and felt like I needed to stand up to play it. My fingers remembered how to play the chords, even though I couldn't draw them. My fingers hurt a little from pressing the strings, but it felt good. 

The electric guitar is not usually played alone, so I think I need to start a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who can't sleep well, I felt like I was the only one talking about how bad not sleeping enough is for our minds, bodies, and moods. People who can't sleep will tell you that sleep is very important for feeling good mentally, physically, and socially. It seems that people who have trouble sleeping know best how important sleep is. So, it's good that sleep is getting more attention now. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about dreams in these talks. We often lose dreams. When you wake up early, you miss the last part of sleep, which is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, where we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen in REM sleep, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This shows that dreams are important. When researchers found REM in 1953, many agreed with Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. But it wasn't that simple. Later studies showed that dreams might come more from physical processes than psychological ones. Now, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study that showed actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams better than other people. He thinks that people who are interested in creativity use dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't all people, like teachers and software designers, need to think creatively? Stickgold says dreams help us think in new and surprising ways, using what we know from the past and present to find new ideas. For example, Stickgold found that when people wake up from REM sleep and are asked to say what they think of a word, their answers are more original than when they wake up from other sleep stages. They think of unexpected things that make a kind of strange sense. This is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a bad dream, or one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and ideas come so fast that I can hardly type them. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complicated world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, you can see the sea, but there are empty frames on the walls. There are also photos of her two daughters. Susie is a famous copyist artist. She can paint like famous artists from the past, such as Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her paintings look so real that even art experts think they are the originals. The real paintings are worth millions, but Susie's copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how long she works on them.

Susie has many clients, including galleries and private collectors. Some collectors like to show off her paintings as if they are the real ones. One famous person likes to say he has a Van Gogh, but it is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. Some people keep the original paintings in a bank and hang Susie's copies at home to save on insurance.

Susie is honest about her work. She makes her copies look very real and signs her name on the back. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and Susie does not do that. She knows people who have done it and got into trouble. Susie is not rich, but she is doing better now and does not want to risk her reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator at a botanical garden. She did not earn much money, but it helped her learn to be very accurate. She has no regrets about that job, but she is happy to have found something that pays better.

When young artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and be accurate. She has studied a lot to do what she does. Susie can draw many things, but she likes French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas the most. Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie says it is not. The impressionists painted quickly but were also very careful, which is hard to do.

Susie does not create her own original art. She says her work is the result of years of training, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried to paint her own things, like fishing nets, but they looked like photos, not special. Susie is a perfectionist and likes to do things perfectly."
39,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything else. She wanted to be the fastest person on the water. From a young age, she was very interested in sailing. She felt a special connection with the boats she sailed around the world. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, normal life seemed boring. People always asked her about the race, and she quickly wanted to return to the ocean. She liked to challenge herself against nature, even in dangerous places.

Ellen came second in the Vendée Globe, a solo race around the world. She showed me her small boat, Kingfisher, where she lived and worked for 94 days. She talked about how she planned everything carefully, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. Preparation was very important to her. She showed me her food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical supplies. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat. It is small, beautiful, and can be damaged. She realized this during a trip to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. She helped with a bird survey there and saw many old whaling stations. This made her think about how people take what they want and then leave. 

When I met Ellen at her office, she was finishing a phone call. She explained why we need to act now to save the planet. She said, ""No one is making coal, oil, or gas anymore. We have to find a way to not use everything up."" At first, she told people to use less, but now she talks about re-using things. She is very interested in things like reusable carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories and talked to governments and businesses about using fewer non-renewable resources.

Ellen started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a sustainable future. She says she misses the adventure of being at sea, but her new work is important. She wants to use her voice to help the planet. She says, ""I may have been the fastest around the world, but this work is more important than anything I've done before."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he could become very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to inspire them to go outside and try new things. Jordan's team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero'. Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

Some experienced climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say a young climber might be strong enough, but they worry if a teenager is emotionally ready. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros know about these concerns. Paul says, ‘I know people criticize us, but I can’t focus on that – we have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.’

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father wants him to? Paul says, ‘This is not about me trying to be famous because of my son. At first, Jordan talked about doing this later, but we thought: ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.’ When I ask Jordan why he likes this challenge, he says, ‘I just focus on reaching my goal.’

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record challenge. This makes Jordan think. People might say that trying to break records is more important than enjoying the climb, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he needs to share his story. This means writing online, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, ‘If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.’"
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they won't know who he is. I am studying music at university, but my classmates don't know much about classical music either. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't have their music. The numbers are not good for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and classical music recordings sell only about 300 copies each. I find this hard to believe. Why are fewer people interested in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract many people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. Some teenagers do go to classical concerts, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I'm not a big classical music fan. I like many types of music, but I don't listen to much classical music. So why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Experts say we can't focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more interesting to teenagers than long classical pieces without words. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people are going to classical concerts now, but I think not many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why more people like classical concerts as they get older, but I know that if your parents love something, you might not like it. Some people say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They like classical music when they play it, but it's not their favorite music to listen to. When we want to relax, we choose pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said quietly. Her mother was getting out of the car too, but she didn’t hear Bonnie. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do so. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be in trouble soon anyway,"" she thought, ""so why not start now?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre. There was an old building for the horses and a large place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She was careful and respectful as she went to the horses. The horses were well cared for, she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony as she touched its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""You’re the best!"" she said. He was brown with a little white. He looked lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" said Bonnie, petting his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. She wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,"" she thought. The room with the riding equipment was unlocked. Bonnie was happy. She put a saddle on Maverick and forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said. ""I know about horses, even if I don’t know about other things."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The movement was exciting, and the wind made her cheeks glow. She felt Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."
43,"I have met Cody Simpson before, and I always liked how he is quietly confident. Cody is a 15-year-old from Australia who has made many popular songs. But how did a relaxed surfer become a famous singer? Cody says, ""I first played the guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" He remembers that he was swimming and surfing every day. These activities were very important to him. When he was 13, he was in high school and posted some videos online. These videos changed his life. He started by posting a video of him and a friend singing at a school concert. People liked it and asked for more videos. Cody made more videos at home and shared them. Many people loved them.

Cody was also a very good swimmer. He trained with top coaches and worked hard to be better. But then music companies noticed him, and he had to make a big decision: stay in Australia and keep swimming or move to the US for music. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very hard for me to choose a career at such a young age,"" he says. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise for many people. I am a quiet person,"" he says. Cody and his family moved to the US, leaving one dream to follow another. His family stays out of the spotlight but supports him. Cody thinks it is important to have good people around you to stay grounded.

Sometimes Cody worries about how his decision affects his younger brother and sister. His brother is eight and travels a lot, doing school on the road. Cody wonders if this is hard for him, but his family always supports him. Success comes from saying ""yes"" to big opportunities, even if they are scary. ""Everything happened so fast,"" Cody says. ""Now, I visit countries I never thought I would see and play for many fans. It is like a dream for many people, but I know it won't last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed and looked out the window at the river. There was a new crack in the ice shining in the morning sun. I looked at the sandbags we put up to stop the river from flooding when the ice melts. My back still hurt from lifting them. Last week, I worked with many people from the town to put the sandbags in place. My grandfather didn’t seem to notice my hard work. I looked at the river where the water was warm from the factory. There was a boy I didn’t know trying to walk on the ice. I put on my kayaking wetsuit and checked my pocket for a silver chain. My grandfather brought it back from South America. I also have his diary from that trip, which I read before bed. I went to the kitchen. 

“Morning, Rex,” Mom said with a smile as I took a banana. “You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.” 

“Thanks, Mom.” I walked down the hall and almost bumped into Grandpa. 

“Watch where you’re going!” he shouted. “Where are you going?” 

“Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.” He should know this because I kayak every morning. Grandpa often gets angry, but I try to ignore it. 

“What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,” he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom came over with a kind smile. 

“Don’t mind him. He’s…” 

“…not himself at the moment,” I said. I didn’t say that he’s always been like this. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me photos of him in National Geographic magazine. Those photos are still on his wall with his medals and trophies. I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now and hope to be in National Geographic one day. But part of me still wants to care about him. 

Mom smiled. “At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!” 

I smiled back and peeled my banana. “It’ll be warmer in South America if I find sponsors for my trip.” She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went outside to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was a painting. It was one of Grandpa's, but it looked different from his other work and was not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in it, but she didn't recognize it. Maybe it wasn't a real river, just an imaginary one. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely there, just a little green, and the eye was drawn to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it seemed right that way. It felt like there was no place for living things in this picture. Jess was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, like she was hiding her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud: ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess what he said."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you that artists don't need to explain their paintings because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone."" ""He said 'ignoramus,'"" Mum corrected, laughing. ""Yes, every ignoramus. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted, still laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" ""Someone who gives an artist ideas."" Jess knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint. He would say the muse wasn't helping him today or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to paint. He never said the muse was her. She thought he meant a goddess, not a person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"This morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I tripped with Dad's knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet by itself. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I will cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm unlucky that way.

I was actually trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's small, white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it. I keep my shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. I always loved Gran's cabinet, so I was excited when she gave it to me. But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it needs to stand in a corner.

I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But Angela is only fifteen, so I think I'll be in my small room for a long time. I don't mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to fit Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a little too tall. If I could just cut a few centimetres off the bottom... Then I thought, if I can't cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. He always tells us to ""think outside the box,"" and that's what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' view, not the humans', which made filming more difficult. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to film from far away. When filming the Borrowers' world, the crew had to film from no higher than 15 centimeters. They wore out many pairs of jeans doing this! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was making the shadows look right when mixing images of tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was very surreal. When I asked them to carry big things like giant scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act. Getting the costumes right was important to me. I made them from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and had to be sewn into her dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for the costumes! Most scenes away from the Borrowers’ home were filmed with actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I drew pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren’t perfect, but they worked. We didn’t have money for special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work fast – I once filmed a whole scene without film in the camera. But it all came together, and I think the series showed the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists, but there are none. I wonder how long it will be before things get crazy. It always happens: fake smiles, people pretending to be friends, and asking for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. ""Everything’s going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so cool and normal. 

I walk into the school’s main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the school secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. Not many people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it’s printing,"" she says. She hands me the schedule. English Literature is my first class. I like English, so that’s good. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, on the second floor. I studied the map last night so I wouldn’t get lost. 

When I reach the door, the teacher is already calling roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I quietly slip in and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! No one will suspect anything now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and says her name is Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them, she lets us socialize. All teachers should do this. 

""So why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many choices. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else pick a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out soon. But I can pretend to be normal for a while. ""He’s an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way."" And she doesn’t seem to care. Perfect."
49,"Text: 'Today, American teenage girls are expected to do many things. They should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in everything. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Teenage boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average. Being average is not enough anymore. People think that not having big goals is being lazy. 

Teenager Kristen Loose says, 'People forget how much pressure teenagers have now. We have a lot of homework, tests, activities after school, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. We also try to have a social life.' Even though these pressures are normal for teenagers today, people still have negative ideas about them. They think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might be like this, it is not fair to say all teenagers are the same.

Kristen Loose says people think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV and using their phones. She thinks this is not true. She keeps her phone close, but not just for fun. It helps her and other teenagers manage their busy lives. People expect students to be connected to the world all the time, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their work anywhere. They can even listen to lessons while going to school. Schoolwork and activities now need attention all the time, making teenagers very busy.

Many teenagers start their day at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the nine hours of sleep they need. A survey found that only 20% of American teenagers get enough sleep. Also, 28% of teenagers said they fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are so tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen does not waste this time on social media or TV. She spends a lot of her free time volunteering. She says, 'People think teenagers only care about themselves, but I love helping others. I want to make a positive impact in my school and community.'

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers might change, but they will still prove it wrong. There will be a new generation of students who will make a big impact on the world before they even finish school.'"
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. This group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. Their project is both a science experiment and an adventure, which is why teenagers like it. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to try to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. 

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside the box, there was a camera, a tool to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were on the outside to help find the box later. A gas tank, given by someone from a nearby state, was used to fill the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy had driven seven hours to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it was time to launch. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they counted, and the balloon went up. Some of them ran and followed it with flashlights until it disappeared into the night. There was a quiet and a feeling of wonder. 

After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the clear sky. It was hard to believe they were just four hours from Los Angeles, a big city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor crossed the sky. 

As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. The lunch box usually lands in a remote area. ‘Recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader. They have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘We have learned a lot about this landscape,’ he said. 

This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the other side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. ‘These students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What seems wild to some is normal for them.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was on a flat rock in a canyon, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but it was a chance to talk about atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. It was also another adventure story to share."
51,"Chloe Morgan didn't like science or Palaeontology much until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. Her younger brother loved dinosaurs, which is common for kids, but Chloe didn't care about them. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new dinosaur discoveries. It amazed her, and she knew she wanted to learn more about it.

Chloe met her first palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous. She was nervous because she thought he might find her annoying with her questions. But he was patient and listened to her, which made her feel better.

Chloe talks about how movies and TV shows show palaeontologists. She says movies like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs but not always in Palaeontology. She thinks movies often show palaeontologists as strange or nerdy, which is not true. Her job is very different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, and writes for science magazines. She also likes to explain science to people, especially young ones, to help them understand more about science.

Chloe helped with a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She made sure the dinosaurs looked right and lived in the same time period. The show was popular because it showed dinosaurs in a new way, different from movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe thinks dinosaurs are interesting because they make us curious and remind us there is still more to discover. Palaeontology is like traveling back in time."
52,"When you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you probably know you are not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" Once you arrive, it becomes ""here,"" not ""there."" So, you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" Parents probably want to be ""there"" more than kids do because they hear this question a lot during long trips.

Think about it: as kids, we can relax in the back seat. We can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the scenery passes by outside. In the front seat, mum or dad gives us juice boxes, cookies, and changes the radio or temperature. They make sure everything is okay during the trip.

But sometimes, things go wrong. My younger brother, Tim, might put his foot on my side of the seat. I do the same, and soon we are fighting. Mum or dad has to stop us and tell Tim to stay in his seat. Then, we calm down and enjoy the view again.

Later, I might feel a breeze on my arm. Tim is blowing air at me from his seat. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is not doing anything wrong. I get angry, and Tim gets in trouble again. Then, we calm down once more.

Dad has ways to deal with us. When we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he sometimes says, ""Yes, get out of the car."" But we are still on the highway, so we know we are not there yet. This makes us quiet for a while.

You know you are finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids. So remember, if mum and dad can still answer your question, then no, you are not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi hope people will enjoy this and come back again. Zuzi says they started this business because people spend too much time on phones and gadgets. They want people to talk and have fun together without screens.

The games in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have simple themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources. Everyone stays involved until the end, and no one feels left out. Later, 'co-operative' games were made where everyone wins or loses together. This makes people talk and work together more. 

One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by another Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He wanted to make games that are fun whether you win or lose. As a child, Leacock loved games but was often disappointed by them. With his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular, and its new version has a lot of storytelling, like video games.

Video games have helped board games become popular. Many people play games on their phones now. Ben Hogg, who works for a games company, says more people are open to playing games today. Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many video games are played online, and players are not in the same place. So, some people want to play games with others in person again.

John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun. In our online world, games are a way to connect with others in real life. This trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced many big UK songs. His story shows why you need to keep trying in the music business, even if things don't go well at first. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. At home, he only listened to a radio station for older people, which influenced him as he grew up. He was 12 when he first heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he was very good at, and music. He spent his school lunchtimes playing the piano. Jamie says, ""I was good at tennis, but I didn't want to do it forever. It was too hard."" At 17, he left school to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who played guitar well but didn't want a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to make music. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he got a music deal at 19 because of one song. But the labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he left his friend. Jamie became famous behind the scenes, not on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he moved to another label to release a new album, but he didn't become famous. Jamie says, ""As an artist, I was often in the wrong place at the wrong time. But as a writer, I was in the right place."" Writing songs for others is where he succeeded. He says, ""I think I'm one of the main writers in the UK, helping new artists start their careers."" He sometimes tells artists that writing popular songs is okay. He asks, ""Don't you want 10 million people to listen to your music next month?"" Jamie wants to write great songs that sell well. He is honest about wanting to write number-one songs. He knows he has the talent to do it. Jamie says, ""When I work with someone, we aim to write the best music for next year. It's not just about being cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs."""
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of famous person. He is very popular online, but many people who don't watch online videos might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist.' This means he does tricks on his bike, like jumping from a roof to a wall. These tricks are filmed and shared online.

I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many local boys knew him, and even older people came to say he is a 'legend.' After watching his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each trick, Tony explains what he will do, and sometimes I can't believe he will succeed. But he always does. When I tell him how great he is, he doesn't seem very excited. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he doesn't like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans and prefers doing tricks instead.

Tony's fame comes from social media and new camera technology. This technology helps him make a living from his videos. He says, 'This technology gives people like me a chance to earn money.' But he also thinks people spend too much time with cameras and screens. Still, he is happy because he can make money from what used to be just a hobby.

I have learned that to become a top athlete, you need energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent. In risky sports, you need mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times but got up and tried again until he succeeded.

Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some people say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people don't understand his sport. They don't know he gets advice from experts to stay safe. Tony is careful about risks. He says, 'Some people never get scared, but they shouldn't do these sports. It's good to know the dangers. I feel fear but find a way to overcome it. I plan and prepare a lot. Sometimes I ride around to get ready before a new trick. I know I must be confident before I jump. If I am fully committed, I am okay.'"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous things for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net. She only had a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she knew some circus skills, she found out that high-wire walking was very different. ‘The training was a surprise,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then I did an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterward. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ But Helen is still planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing. A penny farthing is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Before this, Jeff wrote a book about traveling in Canada in a very old car. He loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip made me want to see the world by bike,’ he says. Jeff didn’t want a normal bike, and he wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bike I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to learn how to make one.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 because of a knee injury, he finally started his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which I couldn’t do, but I never regretted my penny farthing. The further I traveled, the more amazed people were by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in bed for ten days without medicine. He had no money for hospital bills or to go home. Despite all this, Jeff says, ‘if I had the money, I would start traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US. My team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see the ducks at night. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have gone down a lot. We are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night. Before, we did not have the right equipment to see them at night. But now, with this new scope, we can see them clearly, even when there is no moon. This will help us learn more and take better care of the places where they live.

The work is very hard. There are four people on our team, and each of us works six hours every day. We have studied ducks in different places. I have to take a boat to some places and write down notes about every duck I see. The weather is not always good. Some nights are nice, but often it is rainy. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. I like the challenge of this work. In the summer, we will spend hours in a laboratory looking at our results. It will be hard to stay inside, but it is important to do this. I would not change my job for anything!"
59,"When I tell people about my job, they are surprised. But it's true! I work by eating chocolate. My job is to make sure the chocolate from my company is perfect. Every week, I get small pieces of chocolate from our factory. I check how they taste, feel, and smell. I also taste the nuts and fruits we use in the chocolate. I spend time picking the best ones. Next to my office, I have a kitchen. There, I can make and taste chocolate. I give some to my work friends, and they like it! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients. It is nice to have my own space to work. Every day is different in my job. Sometimes I am in the food lab, and other times I travel to buy ingredients. I have a young family, so traveling can be hard. But I like the change and not having a routine. The best part is still the chocolate! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I have worked with it for a long time, but I still love eating it. I even eat more chocolate at home in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which is flying through the air above an audience. The course lasts one year, and students slowly take more risks in each class. Parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. 

Sophia says that for a circus career, performers need to do different things all the time. It is important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important. Circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have imagination, and always try to improve their skills. People often think you might get hurt or only work a little each year. But the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel with the circus while you are young, and then you need to think about other jobs.

The course also teaches business planning. Many students from the past have started businesses around the world and like to share their experiences. Sophia warns that it is not a job for making a lot of money. The work usually means not having a regular salary. It is also competitive, but it is a lot of fun!"
61,"Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. This means she sings behind the main singer. You might not know her name or face, but you have probably heard her sing many times. Some people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers, but that is not true. They need to be very good. People like Mariam are important in the music world!

Mariam loves her job because it is different every day. When she goes to the recording studio, she never knows what she will sing. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock music. Sometimes, she sings funny songs for radio or advertisements. Once, she had to sing like a fish underwater! She never argues and just does her job.

Mariam needs to be very good at music and learn quickly. Sometimes, there is no music to read. She remembers her first time recording music for a film. It was hard because there were eight singers and an orchestra. She was scared because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again. Recording takes a long time.

Mariam also likes working with songwriters. Some new songwriters do not know which music is best for a female voice. When they hear Mariam sing their song, they can learn how to make it better."
62,"Julie Deane started with only a little fashion knowledge and created a successful business with her 'satchels' - a traditional school bag. These bags are now sold in famous shops and are popular with celebrities. Before choosing to make satchels, Julie thought about different businesses, like cake decorating and party planning. She wanted to choose the best idea. Not everyone agreed with her choice, but Julie believed in her idea. She worked with her mother, who had never had a job but was good at business. The design of the bags came from children's storybooks. Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her a lot. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To get more interest, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them. They did, and more people became interested. Now, her company makes satchels faster. Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity has a satchel. Instead of spending money on online ads, she uses the internet to get ideas for new styles. This keeps her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied her design. Now, she makes sure she trusts her production team. People say her office has a good feeling, and everyone likes working there. There is a new factory, but the team is what makes it special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork. 

When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling and bought a special racing bike. He started joining competitions. Vicky thought it looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was near her school, so she could easily go to training after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped competing. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning, but I got tired of it. When the excitement stops, there’s no point.’ Luckily, she started a new career.

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who don’t like sports,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves. CycleZone does a great job and brings young people together.’ The charity uses famous people to help advertise their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people think celebrities only help to make themselves look good, and this can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Ana Ronson is a singer and songwriter from Ireland. Her parents were not musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert and felt happy.

A year later, Ana's brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She liked writing songs so much that she joined a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew a lot about music. But Ana felt the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her feelings. She put this song online, and it became very popular. People left comments saying they loved it and found new meanings in the words.

Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, came from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she did not know the company and did not want anyone to tell her what to sing. But Joss promised this would not happen, and soon Ana performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a great night.

Ana says she likes to write songs about difficult times because she has more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him sad. Ana hopes people will like her songs, but her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not. I wanted to visit the area because I saw it on TV when I was a child. I also knew our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go too, and he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather forecast said the sea would be calm when we were there. I was busy at work and did not have much time to think about the trip. But Harry promised he would take care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group. We packed our things into small boats and started our journey. The guide said very few people lived along that coast. On the first morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands far away, but the fog made it hard to see them. I watched the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I did not know. It was nice not to worry about time. We always made lunch and dinner together over campfires. When we went to sleep on the boats each night, even though the beds were hard, it felt very relaxing!

When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think I would love basketball because of this, but I didn't. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session, but I thought I needed to get better before playing in a real game. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I played my first game against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it went well in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. But I didn't like being far from my parents at first. At home, I didn't have much time with friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. I got used to my new life, and my English got better quickly too!

I became a professional basketball player at eighteen, three years after moving to the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I thought about different jobs and decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and found out that I really liked it. I saw my city in a new way, like the tourists did. After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that I needed to know a lot more to get a licence. In Chicago, guides must answer many questions about the city, like its buildings, history, and transport rules. After some hard but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping the group together. You need other skills too. You should be fun and tell good stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy the tour, not hear about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy, or they might write a bad review online. Good reviews are important because they bring more customers. That’s why I make my tours fun and easy. I put a lot of energy into my job, so my reviews are usually very good, and people often recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to Thailand to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. But in the end, we did not need to worry.

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants happy. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun doing this, even though I got very wet!

In the evening, we took the elephants to the forest where they stayed at night. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so it was a bit small. We chose to share because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we knew it would be like that. The food was delicious and did not have meat, which we liked because we do not eat meat. After dinner, we talked and played games with the other volunteers and staff.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked it, she says she loved it. I am not sure she is telling the truth. I think she might be a little upset because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy her time there fully. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go. Maybe she will go back one day—I know I will!"
69,"My name is Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different people. Some people buy flowers for their friends or homes. Hotels and offices also like to have flowers in their reception areas. Sometimes, we help with photo sessions for businesses by giving them flowers for their pictures. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very happy with what we did.

My day starts very early at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping at that time, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark, but I don’t mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. There are so many colors and smells, which makes it hard to choose. If I chose for myself, I would pick only pink flowers because pink is my favorite color. But I have to remember that other people might like different colors. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can’t find what customers want.

I don’t really like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it is part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at what customers have ordered and put flowers in vases. Then we make flower bunches and decide how much they will cost. Customers are often surprised by the price, and I sometimes ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much work, but I enjoy making the nicest flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That’s what you do when you sell things, and I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the new films I want to see. It also shows many films for kids on the weekends. The cinema is close to my home. But a year ago, I felt something was missing. I wanted to talk about films with people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends!

We decided not to rent a cinema for our club. Instead, we pick a new place in the city each month to show a film. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the film feel more real and exciting! Some places let us use their space for free because they sell snacks during the film. This helps us keep our ticket prices low. We only want to cover our costs, not make money.

Each time we show a film, it gets easier. We have our own equipment now, and we sell tickets online, so we know how many people will come. There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great time, it feels wonderful. Our website helps us connect with other film clubs in the country. We visit them to see how they do things, but we love coming back to our own club.

We also started a blog because most people look online for film information now. We tried putting posters in cafés, but the best way to get people is when others tell their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we do with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz, and everyone enjoyed it!"
71,"When I was a child, I loved taking photos. At 15, I wanted to make my hobby more serious. So, I started a special project: I would take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many different things. Then, someone told me that my project would be better if all my photos had a common theme. I agreed and started taking more photos of nature, like birds and the sky. Many of my photos were in black and white, which was different because most young photographers took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost stopped. But I trusted myself and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos for fun. I was so happy when the judges said I won first prize. It was the first time I thought my photography was really good, and maybe I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I am happy with my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new things like camping, sailing, and public speaking. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new skills. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called 'leaders' help you. When you finish a level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure about it because I had been to that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. But I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate.

Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I made good friends with the children. Now I go there for about four hours a week, and I really enjoy it.

Because of my time at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a youth worker, someone who works with children. I never thought about this before joining the club. This has been my favorite part of the NYC, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several other NYC certificates now, and one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and had not thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. After this, I started to love snowboarding and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people do many competitions and get bored, but I still love competing and winning. This helps me try harder. I like not having a fixed plan. Once, I got a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I started. This made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying because there is no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. This helps me when I can’t snowboard, which I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also want to have another option in case I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time to study at college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't think about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted one too. My parents said I could have a phone if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. This taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't like it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it would be hard, but it was easy for me. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they liked them, but I thought they were just being nice. I wanted to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery to take home as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at the market stall! Then I knew it could work, so I made a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money from my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun."
75,"When Janine Stuart was only 13 years old, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is a little bit about Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine said, ""Because of my dad’s job, my family moved a lot, so I got good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, starting at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s life at home, especially with her older brother. I don’t have any brothers or sisters, so I had to imagine that part."" Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mom always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers told her she should write, so it seemed like a good idea for Janine. The year before, she won a short story competition on a website for young writers. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they wanted to read it right away. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story have some hard problems, and this makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that even though Janine is young and her book is not very long, she is a better writer than some other famous authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer. ""At first, I hid when people knew who I was on the street, but now it’s OK. I’d like to give advice to other young writers, but they have to find what works for them. For me, I just spend time with my friends, and then I have something interesting to write about!"""
76,"My name is Tom. I am fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. This happened because my dad got a job as the castle's manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and lets people visit them. Dad was happy because he thought he might not get such a good chance again. It took some time for us to agree that he should take the job. We were worried about living on the island. We thought the castle might not be as nice as our home across the water, and there was no school on the island. But after we moved, we got used to living there. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment inside is nice. In summer, the island is busy with many visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there are not many teenagers, which I hoped for. The adults help each other with fixing things on the island, which is hard work. The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I was excited to travel on stormy days with big waves, but the boats don’t go then! I learned that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I miss the last boat home, which is scary. So when my friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry! But we often see amazing views, like the sunset over the sea. Some days, it is so foggy that you can’t see anything, and then it becomes sunny again, which is still surprising to me. We do have bad storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle is strong enough. But then I remember it has been here for hundreds of years, and it is still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I love nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby called birdwatching. I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural home. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They taught me how to tell different birds apart and where to find them. It was amazing! After we came back home, I joined a local birdwatchers' club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different kinds of birds. I am close to reaching this goal because, on family holidays, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list. I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I would see my 200th bird there. I didn’t see it, but I learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I made a video about my birdwatching challenge and put it online. Many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fun hobby. My teachers saw the video and asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I was not nervous until I walked onto the stage. I had notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I felt better when it was over, and the teachers said I did a good job. I might do another presentation next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why teenagers in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see, especially in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested. Everyone should connect with nature, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved playing, and soon I became a good player. My family knew I often liked new hobbies and then stopped them, so they thought I would stop playing football too. But I didn’t stop. I dreamed of playing football as a job when I grew up. 

One day, I played in a local tournament, and a referee saw that I was a good player. He told the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. The manager liked how I played and asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. I started training with the club when I was 13 years old. I got much better at football. 

Some people still thought I wouldn’t be a star player, and this made me a bit sad. But my coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in a big match for the club, earlier than I thought I would. I ran very hard because I didn’t want the other players to blame me if we lost. By luck, I scored the winning goal. I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, the team carried me around the field. It was fantastic! 

Since then, I have scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. We want to get teenagers interested in football and let them talk to other players in my club. They will see what it’s like to play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them is the same as my coach’s advice to me: you will have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I have had very few bad times, so I have been lucky!"
79,"In the UK and around the world, schools and universities are now encouraging students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research skills are useful for both studying and working because they help us think about the world and our tasks. As a student, you help create new knowledge. You do this by asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are part of what we call research.

Research can be very complex and done by experts, but it can also be simple and part of everyday life. For example, when you plan a holiday, grow plants, fix things, train a pet, or shop online, you are doing research. In college, you are expected to ask questions, explore information, and create your own ideas. Some students might find this hard because, in some places, knowledge is seen as something you get from teachers and books without questioning. But in the UK, US, and many other places, it is important to question what you learn.

Critical thinking is very important in research. We need to think about what we read and hear, not just accept it as true. We should check if the information is logical and supported by evidence. We should not just believe everything we are told."
80,"Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art in cafés. But living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. 

Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains. They found that cities can make our thinking slower. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients get better faster when they can see trees. Even a small view of nature helps our brains because it gives us a break from city life.

More people now live in cities than ever before. We are crowded into busy places with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a busy city street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and the city layout. This takes a lot of energy. In nature, our brains can relax more because there are fewer things to worry about. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. Nature helps our brains rest and recover.

Long ago, people like philosophers and park designers knew that cities could be hard on our minds. They wanted to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can help our brains work better in just a few minutes. While people try many things to improve thinking, like energy drinks or new office designs, a simple walk in nature is often more effective.

Despite the problems of city life, cities keep growing. They are still places where new ideas are born. Research shows that the busy and crowded parts of cities help create new ideas. Just like 18th-century London, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of creativity. Less crowded cities might have fewer new ideas over time.

The challenge is to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. Sometimes, people want to leave nature and go back to the city for its excitement and opportunities."
81,"Where is the mind? This might seem like a strange question. We usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have special machines that can show this. But I believe we should not only look inside the head to study the mind. There is a lot of evidence, from long ago to now, that shows things outside our heads also help us think. For example, in archaeology, we see that stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have helped humans grow and think. So, I think that what is outside the head can also be part of the mind.

Many people think the mind and the brain are the same. This is because scientists often study people without the things around them. This is important for brain studies, but it makes us forget that we also think with things outside our heads. I am not saying the brain is not important, but I think the mind is more than just the brain. I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET looks at how things become part of our thinking, like when we use clay to make numbers or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how this has changed over time and what it means for how we think.

Think about a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self start? The stick and the person work together. The stick helps the person feel and see. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. This shows that human intelligence can change a lot by using new tools. I see the human mind as always changing and growing. The 'stick' can be anything from old stone tools to the internet. It helps us understand and explore the world. For humans, tools help us learn and know more. This is why humans make things, and these things help shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds change as we use different tools. MET helps us understand how things like stone tools or smartphones change how we think and who we are. Humans have used mind-changing tools since they first appeared."
82,"Photography is an invention that has changed the world a lot. In the United States, photography became very important in many areas like science, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians say photography is one of the biggest contributions of the US to the visual arts. To understand its impact, we need to look at its start in the mid-19th century.

Photography was popular for several reasons. First, it was a mechanical process, which matched the US love for new technology. Like trains and electricity, photography helped people see the world more easily. Second, people used cameras to show their identity and create images of themselves and their families. This was important in a country where people often changed and reinvented themselves. Third, photographs were realistic and showed everyday life, which was a trend in US art.

Photographs are like messages, showing us what the photographer wants us to see. They are made by machines, so they are records of real things. But they also show the photographer's personal view. People often think photographs are a 'universal language' because they show things we recognize. However, understanding a photograph can be complex. We need to consider why it was taken and how it was first seen. The same photograph can mean different things in different places and times.

In recent years, artists have used photographs in their work. For example, US artist Andy Warhol used photographs in his paintings and other art forms. Today, photography is an important part of art, working together with painting to show how we see the world."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American thinker and doctor, called psychology the ""science of mental life."" This idea is still useful today. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we have some idea of what this means. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is mostly about humans. James thought human psychology had basic parts: thoughts and feelings, the world around us, and how we know about these things. Our understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences. Sometimes, we think we know why people act a certain way, like feeling sad or quitting a job. But people can see things differently. Psychology tries to find out which explanations are correct. It helps us know the difference between our own ideas and scientific facts. 

Psychologists study the mind and brain, but they don't know everything about how the brain works. They learn more by watching how people behave and making guesses about what happens inside us. Studying psychology is hard because we can't see the mind like we can see an engine. We have to guess what is happening by looking at behavior. Psychology is like solving a puzzle. It uses clues from careful observation and logical thinking. 

Psychology wants to describe, understand, predict, and change things it studies. It helps us understand our experiences and improve our lives. Psychology has helped in many areas, like teaching children to read better, making machines safer, and helping people talk about their feelings. People have talked about psychology for a long time, but it has been studied scientifically for only about 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means thinking about their own thoughts, to learn about the mind. But this method has limits. William James said trying to understand the mind this way is like trying to see in the dark. Today, psychologists prefer to study the behavior of others instead of just thinking about their own experiences."
84,"In a simple building in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows products that people did not want to buy. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, thinks each product has a sad story. These products were made by designers, marketers, and salespeople who thought they would be successful.

The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who used to work in marketing, wanted to collect a library of consumer products. He began buying one of every new product he could find starting in the 1960s. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection became mostly unsuccessful products.

Many people today are very optimistic, which might be why these failed products exist. In meetings, nobody realized the products would not sell. Sometimes, marketers spend more money on a failing product to try to make it sell, even if it is not a good idea.

In the self-help world, people often use ""positive visualization."" This means imagining things going well, which they believe will make it more likely to happen. However, research by Tali Sharot shows that people often think things will go better than they actually do. People who are not depressed tend to be more optimistic about their abilities.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that thinking too much about success can actually make people less motivated to reach their goals. For example, people who imagined having a great week at work often achieved less.

Carol Dweck, another psychologist, says that how we think about ability affects how we deal with failure. Some people believe ability is fixed and cannot change. They find failure very upsetting because they think it shows they are not good enough. Others believe ability can grow with effort and see failure as a chance to learn and improve. This second group is usually happier, whether or not they succeed."
85,"Sports teams often play better when they are at home. But why is that? Many people think they know, but sports are changing a lot, and what we thought was true might not be anymore. Two things are making us question this: science and money. Sports scientists want to know what helps players do their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. People who pay for sports want to know if home advantage still matters. If players get paid a lot, shouldn't they play well anywhere?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in another country to reach more fans? British fans think their team needs their support. They believe their cheering helps the team score goals. But they forget the times when cheering didn't lead to a goal.

There is one thing that seems true: home fans can influence referees. In an experiment, referees watched a game with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees might avoid making decisions that upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage is less than it used to be, but it still exists. In the 1890s, home teams in England won 70% of the time, but now it's about 60%. Travel used to be hard, but now players travel in comfort. Stadiums are also more similar now.

Home advantage is different in each sport. Basketball teams benefit the most from playing at home, followed by football teams. Baseball teams have the least home advantage. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball needs teamwork. Playing at home might make teams feel more confident.

Another reason for home advantage could be that players feel more protective of their home ground. Before home games, players have higher testosterone levels, which might make them more aggressive. This was seen in the Rugby World Cup, where home teams won against stronger opponents by playing with determination and not giving up. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said the golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports. Many athletes and coaches like it. The saying means that practice makes you better, not really luckier. This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate. This debate asks if talent is something you are born with or something you learn. 

Many people think practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said you can become an expert in anything with 10,000 hours of practice. This idea is in books like Outliers and Talent Is Overrated. These books say practice is the most important thing. But, as David Epstein explains in his book, practice alone is not always enough. 

Epstein looks at why some people are very good at what they do. He travels to places like Kenya, Sweden, and Alaska to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that sled dogs' success might be because of their natural drive, not just training. This suggests that some traits might be genetic. 

Epstein talks about the difference between nature (what you are born with) and nurture (what you learn). He says both are important for top athletes. For example, if Usain Bolt grew up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of a sprinter. Epstein also discusses race and gender in sports. He asks why men and women compete separately if practice is the only thing that matters. This shows how complex the topic is."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her book, ""Kith,"" she explains that children spend too much time indoors, watching TV or using computers, and have lost touch with nature. Griffiths believes this is the main problem. 

A study talked to children and found that many would be happier if they could play outside more. People over 40 often remember their childhoods fondly, saying they had more freedom to explore and play outside. They think this was healthier than how children live today. However, these adults are the ones who now keep their children inside because they worry about safety.

Griffiths argues that fear of danger helps toy and gadget companies sell more products to keep kids entertained indoors. She also talks about how some children are given medicine for being restless or are made to wear goggles for playground games. Griffiths is upset about these things and writes passionately about them.

While her ideas are interesting, Griffiths sometimes goes too far. She compares how children are treated today to racism, which seems extreme. She also believes children should have more freedom to explore and take risks. She says children need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. But she doesn't explain how to make sure these accidents are safe.

Griffiths thinks all children should be free to explore, but not all children are the same. Some are shy and prefer to stay at home. The real problem might be forcing all children to live the same way, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of school. Most problems in life cannot be solved with formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play. Those that have more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because they need to learn more. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, and moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include thinking creatively, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. Creative thinkers can help us succeed. The creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he found it again after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play'. He imagined chasing a sunbeam to develop his theory of relativity. We cannot teach creativity, but we can lose it through schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and this helps them learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit if they want. This makes play democratic. School has become harder: breaks are shorter, homework is more, and grades are more important. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised play. Adults now feel they must solve children's problems. These changes have been slow but big. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, experts warning about dangers, less close neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children need more play, not more school. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change this trend. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to play and explore to grow into strong adults ready for the future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them contact employers directly. In the past, people had to do things like stand outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign to get noticed. But with more access to employers, there is also a bigger chance to make mistakes.

For example, a young person in the US tried to connect with a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts that the young person thought could help him get a job. However, the executive was not happy with this request. She did not want to share her contacts with someone she did not know. She rejected his request and sent a very rude message, which many people saw online. People were shocked by her message, and she might regret how she said it. But this situation shows young people that they need to be careful when using social media for work.

Social media can be dangerous for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. Social media like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of their social lives for years. When I was a teenager, social media was a place to have fun and be different. You could talk to someone online and then ignore them at school. You could change your Facebook page to look more interesting. But using social media for work is different. Some young people do not see the difference.

We learned to be bold and confident online, but this does not always work for job hunting. Just because many people liked your Facebook posts, it does not mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. We need to understand that what we learned as teenagers does not help us in the job world. We must meet employers' standards to succeed.

Employers often say young job seekers on professional sites are too familiar and seem arrogant. This makes older people think we feel entitled. But many young people are just desperate to find jobs, which is why they use social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills to be good workers.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them. Maybe you can help with research or something else. This gives you a better chance of getting a good reply. Do not send the same message to everyone, and be polite. Remember, social media can help you make good contacts, but you need to use it carefully to avoid problems."
90,"Text: 'It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Some people think they will disappear. Since 2000, many UK newspapers have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think newspapers will stop being printed in 15 years. But old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here. Theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and TV. Radio is still popular even with TV, and cinema is still here despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales up a lot since 2008. Newspapers were once new too. They became popular in the 19th century because of new technology like the steam press and telegraph. People started to want news regularly because they saw the world was always changing. In the past, people only noticed the seasons and big events like floods or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. Before that, people did not need news every day or week. Newspapers have a set format and schedule, which can be limiting. Online news is different. People can read it whenever they want and choose what interests them. Online news can update quickly and correct mistakes fast. There is no limit to how much can be written. But online news often focuses on being first and getting comments, which can cause confusion. In the past, news was shared in places like markets or taverns, where it mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand the world better in the future.'"
91,"If humans were comfortable under the moon and stars, we would enjoy walking in the dark. Many animals are active at night and feel at home in the dark. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This is part of our nature, even if we don't often think about it. We have changed the night by adding light everywhere. This is like building a dam in a river. It helps us, but it also causes problems called light pollution. Light pollution happens when lights are not designed well. They shine up into the sky instead of down where we need them. This extra light changes the night and affects animals and people. It can change how animals migrate, reproduce, and eat. 

In the past, the idea of light pollution would not make sense. Imagine walking to London at night in 1800. It was the biggest city in the world, with almost a million people. They used candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no streetlights yet. From far away, you would smell London before you saw its dim light. We have lit up the night as if no animals lived there, but many animals are active at night. Light is very strong and attracts many animals. Birds can get confused by bright lights and fly around them until they are too tired. Some birds even sing at night because of artificial light.

People used to think light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the stars clearly. Most of us don't need to see the night sky for work, but we do need darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can make us sick. Our sleep and wake cycles are connected to the Earth's light and dark cycles. Changing these rhythms is like changing our balance. In the end, we are affected by light pollution just like animals near bright lights. We have lost our connection to the stars and the natural day and night cycle. Light pollution makes us forget our place in the universe and the beauty of a starry night."
92,"The boss of a big company said that his company will not count how many days off employees take. This idea came from another internet company that did the same thing. The boss got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in newspapers. Some people think this is just a way to make the company look good, but is it a good idea?

The internet company is small, with 2,000 workers and one service. The big company has 50,000 workers and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a small company where everyone knows each other's work. In a big company, it is harder to know if taking time off will hurt the business.

The boss said workers can take time off if they are sure their work is done and it won't hurt the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? When you take a holiday, work piles up. This can make people feel guilty about taking time off, which can lead to stress and less work done in the long run.

There might also be pressure from other workers about who takes time off and when. In many companies, people work late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture where people don't take time off because they want to get promoted. If there are no set holidays, people might feel they can't take time off because they don't want to look lazy.

Modern technology means we can get work messages anytime, anywhere. The internet company started the unlimited leave policy because workers asked how this new way of working fits with old holiday rules. If the company can't track work hours, why should it track holiday time? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Workers might feel they are always being watched, which can be stressful.

Workers have a right to a certain amount of paid holiday because rest is important for health. The good things like more creativity and productivity that come from unlimited leave can happen without this policy. So, I am not sure if ""take as much holiday as you want"" is really what the company wants or if it will work."
93,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This is to make sure the research is good and not wrong. It can take up to a year to review a paper. Some people think this is important to make sure the research is trustworthy, but others are not so sure. 

The way scientific publishing works is changing. Preprints are part of this change. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed. They help share new research quickly so others can read and discuss it. Publishing in journals is often about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can lead to problems. Scientists might leave out important data to get published in top journals. Reviewers sometimes focus more on whether a paper is interesting rather than if it is good science.

Preprints have been around for 20 years, but not everyone uses them. Some scientists worry that journals will not accept papers that were shared as preprints. Others fear that without peer review, bad science might be published. However, preprints allow for open discussion and feedback from many people around the world. 

Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. She said that preprints allowed for open discussion and feedback, which is not always possible with traditional journals. Preprints also help share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals. 

Preprints make it easier for more people to read and cite papers. They focus on the research itself, not just where it is published. This openness and sharing are important in the scientific community."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is like a ""painting in words."" These answers don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it. The first paragraph should describe it like a scientist, and the second should be from the object's point of view, called ""Poem."" One student wrote:

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry is different from anything else. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions.

When I was in school, poetry was confusing to me. I thought poems were puzzles that stopped me from understanding and feeling. After school, many people lose interest in poetry. Sometimes, you see a poem and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. You try to read it, but often feel let down because it is hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we want from poems? Are they for deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever thoughts? Maybe. But for tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music combines words and melody beautifully. But poems have something special: they can be unclear, like life often is.

If you search for ""poem"" online, it leads to ""poetry,"" which is described as a type of art using the beauty and rhythm of language. But the word ""poem"" comes from Greek, meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things."" So, what kind of thing is a poem? Some poets say poems are like wild animals or machines, but these ideas don't fully explain poems. The best part of comparing poems to other things is the discussion it creates. It can change how we think about machines or animals and help us see things differently.

A poem can stick in our minds, like song lyrics. Words and music together are powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. Words can be strong, like sticks and stones. A poem in a newspaper or magazine can have a big impact, even though it is just ink on paper. Poems take up space that could be used for longer articles or ads, but they are not made to be sold like other writings. Poems are special and can surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I have found many brooches and coins, and each one makes me happy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 

One rainy February afternoon, I had some free time and decided to go to a place I knew. It mostly had old farming tools. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I almost ignored it but decided to check. I dug half a meter down and saw a round, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, like curtain rails I found before, so I didn't get too excited. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, patterned loop. I realized it looked like the Great Torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. 

I took it to my car and drove home, looking at it the whole way. At home, I washed it in the sink. I called Marion and showed her. She was surprised. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. I hid it in our wardrobe, but I was worried, so I later hid it under a floorboard in my office.

The law says you must report such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before giving it up. I even showed it to a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The registrar was surprised when he saw it. The torc was checked and sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the field owner and me. But the torc is more than just money. It is something I saved for the nation. People ask if I will stop detecting now, but I still enjoy finding brooches and coins. Like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I keep going, hoping for another great find."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy travel plans, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for naps in the afternoon and lazy mornings in bed. Sleeping better is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, I could sleep deeply and have many dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. I think sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. We process all this new information while we sleep, which makes travel sleep more intense. Sleep also changes with different places. People often talk about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local habits is more important. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I truly belong there. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all took naps on hammocks and sofas. I finally understood the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said kindly to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little hat will make me stand out."" She touched the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this is the one I want."" Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, Tattie, who was coming too. Mia's husband, Jeff, had asked, ""What kind of name is Tattie?"" Mia explained, ""It's short for Tatiana. I think it’s nice."" Jeff didn’t like fancy things and always spoke his mind. He would have told the woman in the shop that she chose the wrong hat. He often told Mia, ""You’re too polite."" An hour later, Mia closed her shop and went home. Her shop was next to her house, so it only took forty seconds to get home. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia turned the barn next to their house into a shop. Jeff was unsure. ""Do you think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew people wanted hats for special occasions. She was right. After Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats became popular. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. They could try on many hats in a friendly place. Mia also sold handbags and costume jewelry now."
98,"Lawrence Okoye has moved from London to Atlanta, USA. He is on an exciting sports journey. Lawrence used to compete in the discus throw and even reached the Olympic final. Now, he is trying something new: American football. Even though he has never played American football before, he might join a big team in the USA. In Atlanta, he is learning about his new position in the sport.

Lawrence is 21 years old and from London. It seems surprising that he might play for a top American football team. But Lawrence is used to surprising people. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on sports instead. He played rugby before and became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world in just 20 months.

Lawrence went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus. He was getting ready for the world championships. He thought about American football before but only decided to try it when he got to the USA. He read about NFL trials in Atlanta and applied, even though he had never played the game. He was not nervous about the trials and did very well in the tests. Coaches told him he has the skills needed for American football. He knows he has to work hard.

Lawrence is waiting to hear if he will be selected for an NFL team. He is not worried because there is no pressure on him. He remembers his Olympic experience, where he did not do as well as he wanted, but he is proud he made it to the final. If American football does not work out, he can return to discus, which he loves. Lawrence is trying to achieve a dream he had since he was a schoolboy. He has made careful decisions about his sports career."
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daytime. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty land below. The dark colors of brown and green made me feel better because, even though it was mid-September, it had not started snowing in Siberia yet. I saw no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to a far place to sell safety clothes to the local mining industries. His English was almost as bad as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I wanted to return home to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I told him I believed there was a road, though not many people used it now. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and said one word, ""Holodna"" (cold), pointing outside. I tried to show Sergei with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, but I didn't tell him that because my trip was self-funded, I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my big postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students sitting tiredly. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer kept talking. I was thinking hard about a question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to control my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to have adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He loved adventures after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since that first ride we took together, Al had been setting himself bigger and bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest challenge so far. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would be too hard for him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an amazing adventure, finding that he could handle each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the people who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns flying through tall pylons, which are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to see what it feels like to be part of this. 

An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first form said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small things can be dangerous during the flight. I learned that I needed to stay aware of where I was. Someone told me, ""The horizon is your best friend,"" and the pilot would tell me where to look. I also promised to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. They told me not to touch anything. When we were moving down the runway, I tried not to touch the important pedals with my feet or the switches with my hands. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. 

In high-speed flying, you need to stay calm and focused. You have to tense up and relax at the right times. Panicking is not good. This was not comforting as we started moving fast down the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we quickly turned right. It was a strong move, and I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed my body, and took short breaths. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, making my stomach feel strange. 

Seconds later, we were 10 meters above the ground, flying between two pylons at 400 km per hour. I felt excited for a moment, but then we turned sharply right. We hadn't even done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I got to fly the plane. My hand was shaking, and the plane shook too because it was very sensitive. Then Dario said something, but instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I said. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle. 

Some people might find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, when we were upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what pilots experience in a race. To show this, Dario ate sandwiches happily after we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night I dreamed about the loop over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature documentary, he probably filmed them. He likes it when the temperature is -18C. Allan studied to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned how to survive in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I took the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I knew I wanted to be a wildlife cameraman. It had everything: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife series. ‘I started at a good time. When I began, not many people had been to the Antarctic. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed.’ The camera and technology were very simple when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is easier to film today. Before, you had to remember what you filmed. Now, with digital technology, you can film a lot and see it right away. You had to think about what shots you needed next and what you missed. You filmed less because film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is my experience in cold places. I know how it feels. I have spent so much time on sea ice it feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes, but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases, or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, has great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he could not tell which birds they were. When Allan got permission to film for a big TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he knew it would not be easy. It is a place with polar bears and is very dangerous. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong, and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very hard. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan saw just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, he says, he was living like a bear. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We move to stay warm. After five hours of watching, I see something. The camera is ready, and I look through the viewfinder. Nothing for a few seconds, then a black nose. The nose becomes a muzzle, then a head, and in less than a minute, she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow. She looks at me but is not worried. I think this can’t get much better … then she slides down the slope. I think she is having fun,’ he says, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘It’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan wants to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and see the impact of it. He says he could make an amazing documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies. He had to swim in very cold water and face frostbite and polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic for a new, bigger challenge. Pen and two friends will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole in three months. They will measure the ice thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the information is very important for scientists. This will show how global warming is affecting the ice.

Pen was trained for this. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who worked for a famous explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She made him go out in the cold with little clothing to make him tough. His father loved cold adventures, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps with his polar guide business and says she worries more when he is at home because he is always thinking about the Arctic. For fun, Mary once raced against him in a mountain event. She finished an hour before him.

Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. Pen finds it hard to leave them this time. Last time, he told his son to take care of the family, which was too much for the boy. So, this time, Pen will not contact them much while he is away. He is busy getting ready for the trip. On the ice, fixing things is very hard, so he must prepare well. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer, will join him. A team of six will fly in supplies.

Being in a team is stressful for Pen. He is also worried because he is turning 47 and has not trained enough. Organizing things took more time. Pen believes this mission is important for science. Before, reaching the North Pole was a personal goal. Now, the data will help scientists, and more people will learn about the Arctic. Pen says their skills are now very useful."
103,"I took a year off from my usual activities. I was an Olympian, which was amazing. During this time, I did some writing, worked on TV, and spoke to businesses and schools. These activities were fun, but I missed competing. I wanted to stay fit in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I started running marathons and doing triathlons. 

Then, TV presenter Ben Fogle asked me if I wanted to row across the Atlantic Ocean with him. I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to my rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. I knew if I joined the race, I would want to win. I wasn't sure if Ben was the best partner for winning, but the idea of being an underdog was interesting. 

Ben was already planning to do the race and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. We talked about the costs, which were very high. The boat and equipment alone cost £70,000. We thought we had a good chance, but it would be hard work. I also had to think about losing money from not working while racing. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money, and people are interested in my past achievements. But I wanted a new goal, like rowing across the Atlantic, to talk about.

Preparing for this adventure taught me to appreciate the life of a full-time athlete. Training for the Olympics was hard, but everything was organized with doctors and dieticians. I was worried people would think I just wanted to be on TV by racing with Ben. But during our preparations, I realized the race was more about mental strength than just rowing. Ben had done tough challenges before, like the Marathon des Sables and living on a deserted island. But he wasn't good at rowing. I was surprised by how little he knew about it, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I should have known his skill level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. I was 26 years old and feeling restless. I wanted to see the cold and quiet places of the Arctic, maybe because London was too noisy and crowded for me. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They let me work as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow. These rides can last from one hour to five days. Anna and Pasi started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm', which is pretty but has no reliable electricity or running water. They said I could join them for three months if I understood the work would be hard. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical,’ they said. I started packing right away.

November 6, London On my flight, I looked at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I was supposed to learn their names before I arrived, but I felt nervous and couldn't focus. I put the page down and looked out the window. People say that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, with flowers and leaves opening. But I felt like I was seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus ride north was just what I hoped for. We drove through dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrived at the farm after dark and was given boots and sent outside into the cold. 'Do you want to start right away?’ Anna asked. It wasn’t really a question. I followed the barking sounds, which got louder as I reached the dogsheds. Three people were busy getting the huskies ready and putting them in harnesses. The dogs were very excited and eager to go. I could hardly hear to introduce myself, and the others were too busy to talk. I stood on the side and petted one of the quieter dogs. Someone waved at me to get in a sled, and I almost fell into it. A command was given, and we started moving into the dark, with only a headlamp for light.

November 15, Hetta It didn’t take long to become part of the husky guide team, but first, I had to answer questions about what I could do. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asked. I didn’t know what to say. I had never driven a snowmobile, hadn’t done woodwork since school, and never used an axe. 'Do you have a driving licence?’ someone asked. I nodded, feeling relieved. The basics of dog-sledding are easy to learn: lean into corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But other things are more complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and giving water to the dogs are hard in the cold. Water freezes quickly, so we make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head was full of instructions, and my muscles hurt from pulling heavy sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I felt proud. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I emailed my friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and crossed the finish line. The press was amazed by her run. Her time was so good that she could compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Reporters asked her about emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had told her to use it after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she didn't really understand how big her achievement was at the time. She felt it was just what she was supposed to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits.

During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was with him. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep running so fast. Hartmann was angry about this but understood why someone might think it was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast and still managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would beat that time soon. Radcliffe thought she could do it again next year, but it didn't happen.

After the race, people wondered how she beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her a lot, helping her with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said she could handle a lot of pain. He would have to press very hard on her muscles, and it hurt his thumbs. Hartmann traveled 13 hours from Ireland to her training place in France. When he arrived, her husband said, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" She was ready for a two-hour session. She worked very hard, and that made her great. Hartmann spent so much time with her that other athletes were upset.

Radcliffe doesn't know why no one has beaten her record. She trained very hard, but she thinks others are more talented. She thought Mary Keitany might do it. Radcliffe says maybe people are racing each other instead of racing themselves. She always pushed herself, even when she was winning. That marathon was the best race of her career. She never ran that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, came out, I didn't know how people would like it. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I thought our show was new and different, but I was still worried. Would people like a cooking show that talked about techniques, history, memories, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my restaurant experiences. Each project feels like a journey, whether it's about the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often a real one, with travel and meeting new people. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest book, where you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best golden pasta. These people have spent many years trying to make perfect food. Perfection is different for everyone. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But after a long meeting, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on their feelings, memories, and surroundings. I knew from the start that I wouldn't say the recipes were the best. But I thought I could use my skills and knowledge to find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV series let me explore new foods, people, and places. I was excited about this, just like when I started in this business. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. Some of my adventures included visiting a factory that had the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that wasn't good enough to film. I also tried new techniques, like hand-milking a cow to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down to make a perfect pizza."
107,"We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field. It stopped moving. John got out and looked at the engine. He stood there for a long time. Then he said, ""I don’t know what I’m doing,"" and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried and said, ""We can’t stay here forever."" The field was big, with grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was safer to be on her side. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. John went to find someone who could help with the van. Mum lay on the grass and asked for a story. Bea lay next to her. I told them a story about two birds I heard talking in London. They talked about breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. They even argued about a worm. Bea said it was silly because no one understands birds. I said I did, but I wasn’t sure. Mum was asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped push the van to a hotel. Bea stayed in the van, but the boys waved and smiled at her. We went into a café near the road. John said it might be expensive, but Mum said we’d just have tea. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum said it was like syrup. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. He said it was a miracle the van got us this far. Mum made a bed for us outside in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on the ground. John said we’d have to be towed into Marrakech. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled behind us. Bea didn’t want to move, so John carried her to the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I wondered how we’d get home since our van needed to be towed. I thought maybe we could take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city. Lucy didn't hear her name well because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy. They spoke English well and talked about the music they were playing and their travels.

Lucy told them, ""I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer."" It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She didn't want to do many of the things that took her around the world, like concerts and competitions. She missed so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She didn't even want to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. Her mom had filled out the application and sent in a CD without telling her. ""I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,"" her mom said. Lucy thought it was more like her mom didn't want her to say no.

The guy from Tokyo asked, ""Tanglewood?"" Lucy said, ""Yeah."" He asked, ""How old are you?"" ""Fifteen,"" she replied. He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't mean to brag. It was hard to know when she was just sharing or showing off. ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying,"" she explained. Liesel/Louisa left to talk to someone else, but the guy from Tokyo stayed. He asked if she had been to Japan. Lucy said, ""Once. When I was, like, eight.""

Then, Lucy's grandfather came and said, ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone."" He took her away from the conversation. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition,"" he said. ""They're not the competition,"" Lucy replied. ""Everyone is the competition,"" her grandfather said. He made her talk to important people at the party. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she only heard about half of what was said.

In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ""You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" Lucy liked being somebody, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special to the kids at her old school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this festival, she knew she mattered."
109,"Dad said, ""It's not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to go out into the real world."" It's hard to argue with him, so I wanted to see what experts say. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, feel like they belong, and are learning important skills for the digital age. 

Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers live in it, not just use it like adults do. It's not good or bad; it depends on how you use it. Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says social media is like the youth clubs parents went to when they were young. It helps teenagers find out who they are and learn to get along with others.

Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says being a teenager is about asking, ""Who am I?"" Social media can help you find your identity. You can share your favorite music or sports and see different opinions. Research shows that people who use social media a lot are not as self-centered as those who don't. It can also help shy people because talking online can be easier than face-to-face.

Professor Andrew Phillips studies how young people use social media. He thinks it helps quiet people with special interests connect with others. If you like a rare type of music and only a few people at school like it too, you can find a group online and feel less alone.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says young people who find new interests online and create their own content are using social networks well. Teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers learn and share their work. This can help in jobs because businesses use social media to sell products. If you have many friends on social networks, they can be your customers.

Matthews agrees that teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they start working. Many sites let you work with others to create and share content. Working together is an important skill for jobs today."
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they don't usually think of a long trip through nine western states in the US and a part of Canada. But my parents wanted something different for our summer vacation this year. My dad planned a big family trip. He and my mom kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" while my twin brother and I looked at each other, thinking, ""There are probably good reasons why!"" In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With just enough space for us in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our big home for smaller places to stay over the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into. We drove west through Oklahoma. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under very dark, starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that on the road, cows have the right-of-way! The next day, we got up early and started driving again. I noticed a pattern. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to feel the same, but each adventure was different. We walked in the Great Sand Dunes and went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. We learned that roads for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of old and new things. We got used to traffic because of road work. We laughed when we saw big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We saw many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sun set over bear areas near the roads. Traffic would stop to let bears cross, and we had a close encounter with one, which gave us unforgettable memories. As we traveled, life at home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with no internet or phone service, didn't make us less excited. Instead, we enjoyed the beautiful views. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we drove back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to a faraway place to find something amazing. It was nice to be home again, and I didn't fight with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our trip to look through. I knew I would remember the unplanned and spontaneous moments.'"
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job in another country, and her mother, Dahlia, would go with him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school and live at the college. She had a nice room with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would still watch over Amy.

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a little about her grandmother from holidays. She never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose’s parents were not very happy, but Daisy wanted to know her granddaughter again. Rose did not know why her parents did not like her grandma, but they had a disagreement in the past. Rose was ten years old when she last saw her grandmother, but she had happy memories.

Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy liked to meet people and bring them together. Rose would soon have dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady. Daisy went to many social events.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new phone for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to make good decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were problems, they would talk about it.

Rose was not a wild child. Her school friends were like her, so her school reports and exam results were always good. In five weeks, Rose would start a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth school in five years, so she was used to it. This was the last time because she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to think she might write a novel. Charlotte thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed hard. She didn't know what other teenagers were doing, like being in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a book. Now, the book she started then is about to be published. She told her old teacher, who was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't understand why she should wait if she could be good at it now.

It's a winter afternoon at Charlotte's publisher's office. Even though I knew I was going to talk to a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a big achievement: the story is strong and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, shows it was written by a teenager. A public relations person is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn't. Charlotte is confident and smart, but also calm.

Charlotte knows she is young. I ask her about the difficult questions in her book. She says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don't have many life lessons to share,"" she laughs. ""I don't think my age limits my understanding, but I'm not very wise either. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.""

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are shown in books. She says there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows nothing, and the awkward teenager who isn't good socially. Reading about these types annoyed her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who are okay. Some writers make teenagers feel they can't know who they are because they aren't experienced. This can hurt their confidence.""

Charlotte loves reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost stopped her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers talk about deep things. I asked myself: do I have to do this to write a good book?"" She likes a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It says if the reader guesses what will happen, the suspense is gone.""

Some might say Charlotte's parents, who are journalists, helped her get her book published. Her father's friend in publishing helped get her book read. She knows she was lucky because getting a first novel read is hard, no matter the writer's age. ""Every writer needs support and luck, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte says."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew into the air, but something was wrong. We watched closely. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On other skiing holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it. I was afraid people would laugh at me. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and tried new tricks, landing in foam cubes. After practising inside, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers just went down the slopes and hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down again. Land in the right place, and you keep moving. Land on the flat, and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs would slow down, and I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises were like ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth talked to us as we practised. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work. Every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more problems before I finally landed right. Gareth was as happy as I was, and I felt proud. But that didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I didn’t slow down before the jump, landed in the right place, but then saw my skis sliding down the slope without me."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight as the ride stops and then slowly goes up. There is a pause, and then a fast drop makes your stomach feel funny. You move quickly forward, turn left, and go upside down. Everything is a blur, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose to be there, like many others who pay to enter theme parks every year.

Amusement parks are a big business. They have exciting rides to attract people. Behind these rides, there are many people working hard. There are engineers, designers, and marketing experts. They make sure the rides are fun and safe. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' sounds like a dream job for a child. But it is a big challenge. Designers must make rides that are fun and a little scary, but not dangerous. They also need to create new things to keep people coming back.

Many people think rollercoasters are getting more intense. But most of the ideas used today were created by John Miller, a designer from the early 20th century. Back then, rides were more extreme, but now designers have to follow rules and use certain track designs.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts said it’s about making people feel like they are being thrown around but still safe. The best rides tell a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and have exciting features like tall drops or many twists.

Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trying new things are important. Jeff Hornick, a theme park director, agreed. He said designers need to love thrills to understand what people want and to test the rides.

I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said not to expect big changes soon. Virtual reality can add something extra, but the real rollercoaster experience is still the most important part. New technology is exciting, but the physical ride will stay important for a long time."
115,"Miranda Ellington is 25 years old and has done a lot as a choreographer. She makes dances for many theatres and dance companies. Sometimes, she still dances herself. She says dancing helps her remember what it feels like to follow orders from choreographers, which can be hard and stressful. As a choreographer, she teaches and likes working with young students. New dancers are open to trying new things and taking risks. They want to succeed but don't always know their strengths and weaknesses. They listen to feedback, even if it's tough, and sometimes they give her honest feedback too.

When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on dance steps, and the music guides her. Even if she doesn't like a piece of music, she tries to create the best dance for it. If dancers don't like the music, it can be frustrating, but she has to find solutions. She can't change the music because it's already chosen for big productions. She wishes she could try different music to make rehearsals more fun.

Miranda doesn't want to work with just one theatre or school. She thinks it's important to meet new people and adapt to different styles. This helps her stay flexible and not get stuck in one way of working.

Recently, there was a documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says it shows the real life of a dance company. One scene shows a young dancer getting many corrections, which is common. The public often doesn't understand how much work ballet requires.

I asked Miranda what makes a great dance show. She says it's when everything like music, costumes, lighting, and dancers come together. Even if not everything is perfect, aiming high is important. Sometimes, good dance steps can be ruined by bad costumes or props.

Miranda has done many different types of work. People want to label her as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist, but she doesn't like that. She wants to explore many areas and not focus on just one thing. For now, she wants to keep learning and trying new things."
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on TV. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there is so much to see and do? This conversation gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and used old seatbelts to hold it. I put my bags on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I have been on many walking trips before, but this was different. It was the longest I have ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of eating sandwiches on a rock. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I like to say how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can see the film on my website.'"
117,"When I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. At the Greek port, the man was surprised when I asked for one ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I told him I would join ten others to swim around the islands. He still looked confused but smiled and let me on the ferry. Our group had sent emails before the trip, but we didn't have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides told us a support boat would be with us, and they showed us how to talk to it. We did a short swim to divide into speed groups, then we started our first 1.5 km swim. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and swam in a river, but never in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group, which was not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first swim, and I was happy when I did it by myself. The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to look at the scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and enjoyed them more. We didn't need the support boat much. I can't wait to come again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant is not easy, but I love it. Since I started, I have traveled to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and my life is never boring. This job is perfect for a young person like me!

When I was a child, I went to a school in another country, away from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers. Some of them let me help. I remembered this when I wanted to leave my banking job and try something new.

At the interview for the flight attendant job, there were many young people. Many of them were like me, changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and my past work experience, not just that I loved to travel. I got the job!

I recommend this job to anyone. There are many good things about it, but free flights are not the best part. Airline staff work very hard, and we have a saying: ""No one’s finished till everyone’s finished."" We are like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close.

When I am not working, I don’t have to think about work. If I have difficult passengers, which doesn’t happen often, I know the flight will end soon, and I won’t see them again."
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children do things they never thought they could do. Most children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel scared, but after we encourage them, they try it and reach the top. This makes them feel very happy. 

Some children miss home at the start of the week. It's not the very young ones who miss home the most; it's usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we say they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's too late now, call tomorrow. Most children feel okay after a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time.

Sometimes, it's not just the children who feel lonely. Some parents call a lot to ask how their child is doing, which is not needed. Often, the child is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we tell the parents to call back later. We also have some children who come in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors also play music. It started in London last year after being in the USA for five years. In the USA, it won ‘Best Musical’ four times! In the UK, it was hard to do the show with only British actors. In the UK, young actors can do fewer shows each week than in the USA. So, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. The director found many talented actors in the UK, and they won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it is full every night. People want to hear the songs that were first popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me the young actors are busy. ‘We have school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ What do his friends think of the show? ‘My whole class came! The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he said. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found another guitar and asked me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days. I didn’t know it, but Jamie helped me, and I was happy when I got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! The young actors were already musicians, and some play many instruments, but none had played in a band before. They found it easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first played together. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is really worth seeing.'"
