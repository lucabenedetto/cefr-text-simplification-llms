1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—when you announce your location online. The website's message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing too much online can have negative effects. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost. 

This might sound discouraging, but don't lose hope. There is guidance from early internet users who explored these challenges before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, faced job losses, made and lost friends, and dealt with the ups and downs of online fame. They have already experienced what many of us are going through now. It's worth learning from their experiences because, as the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. But Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, attracting readers with his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was open: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While his work was very personal, it also had a certain artistic quality.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He explained that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the issue remains. Sharing online is appealing, but if you expect it to make people like you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned to manage what she shares online. Armstrong's experience teaches us that while the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe that we don't understand. Most scientists agree with this idea because no one claims to know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it anything from ""atrocious"" to ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.

At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film talked about how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film mentioned discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher supposedly showed that the shape of a water molecule could be changed by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing because it is simple and clear. However, scientists usually respond with skepticism, saying, ""Give me a break."" They believe that while the idea is amazing, there needs to be solid proof that it is real. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough.

The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. Recent discoveries show that the universe is indeed stranger than we thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy.""

Other discoveries are equally amazing. Neuroscientists found that our conscious perception of events is about half a second behind reality, but our brains edit this delay out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.

Science is far from complete. In fact, we seem further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some of the world's top theoretical physicists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people believe the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,"Writing novels is a challenge for me, while writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. Writing each type might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch between them. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers liked seeing this other side of me. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revising can take longer). It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You can finish a short story quickly and move on. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I'll make it through. So, writing short stories is a nice change of pace. Another good thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, a word, or an image. It's often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don't have to worry about failing. If an idea doesn't work, you can just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. This is comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in your next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories' successes and failures. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like soft shadows I've left in the world, faint footprints. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers."
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is clear to experts, but its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and they often ignore or exaggerate its mistakes.

Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced by new ones, similar to how new music styles are first mocked but later accepted. Scientists often disagree, and emotions like jealousy and anger are common. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. We will admire these ideas but also question them, recognizing both human creativity and limitations.

Science is always changing. Scientists constantly challenge each other's ideas. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned this view, showing that observing the universe can change it and that we don't fully understand basic concepts. Some people see this as a weakness of science, but scientific changes often improve our understanding and ability to predict nature. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing.

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, relativity, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe. Maybe.

Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have gone from observing nature to controlling it, sometimes upsetting its balance without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the world their children will live in and even the children themselves. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. Deciding how to use science is not just for philosophers; it affects national budgets, health, and the future of life on Earth."
5,"Around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed book. Despite evidence that digital and print books can coexist, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. This idea continues to spark our imagination and debate. Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about new technologies and change.

Historically, whenever new technologies appear, people predict the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would disappear. However, radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and workplaces. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. In 1894, some thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, television, and smartphones, all supposedly threatening print books. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks.

The idea of the book's death often appears during technological changes. This reflects our hopes and fears about new technology. We form emotional connections with media like books, TVs, and computers, making them a core part of our lives. Studies show we even name our cars or get frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it changes our relationship with familiar things. This can make us nostalgic for what we used to have, leading to industries focused on retro products. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people sought original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have made people appreciate the physical quality of old books, even their smell.

This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. However, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power and our resistance to change. We often use familiar story patterns, like tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the book's death reflects our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, almost every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest minds from the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—like when they slept, ate, and worked—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, showing them as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and if you nap afterward."" In this way, my book is about the conditions for creativity, not the creative work itself. It’s about the process, not the meaning. 

The book is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even writing a business letter reveals something about your inner self. My book explores questions I face in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to focus entirely on one project or to dedicate a small part of each day to it? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time, as my dad always says, ""work smarter, not harder""? I don’t claim to answer these questions, as some may not have clear answers and might be resolved only through personal compromises. However, I have tried to show how various successful people have dealt with similar challenges. I wanted to illustrate how big creative ideas are built through small daily efforts and how working habits affect the work itself.

The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine might seem ordinary and thoughtless, like being on autopilot. But with the right approach, a routine can help you make the most of limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can guide your mental energy and help you avoid being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and couldn’t stick to a regular schedule. 

Interestingly, it was procrastination that led to this book. One Sunday, I was alone at the architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a morning person, focused in the early hours but not very productive after lunch. To feel better about this, I started looking online for other writers’ work schedules. I found them easily and they were entertaining. I thought someone should collect these stories, so I started the Daily Routines blog that afternoon, which eventually led to this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine profiles, and obituaries. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the original’s brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of an unexpected change in his family's plans when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain due to rising interest rates. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. During this holiday, Howard found an ammonite on the beach, which sparked his interest in palaeontology. 

As he grew older and studied at university, Howard realized he wanted to focus on the earliest periods of life, rather than the more popular Jurassic period with dinosaurs. He was interested in the very beginnings of life, studying ancient, delicate creatures in rocks. After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard was concerned about finding a job, especially in a place he wanted to work. He was confident in his abilities but knew that getting a job wasn't always fair.

When a job opened at Tavistock College in London, Howard applied, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't attend due to an accident. The replacement professor disliked the absent professor and made sure Howard got the job instead. Howard was initially grateful for the unexpected support, but later learned the real reason he was chosen. He was slightly disappointed but was mainly happy to have the job he wanted.

Howard often thought about how his professional life was orderly, with clear plans and goals, unlike the unpredictable nature of personal life. He experienced this unpredictability when his briefcase, containing important lecture notes, was stolen at an Underground station. Frustrated, he returned to the college, postponed his lecture, and reported the theft. While having coffee with a colleague and a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, he learned about a new collection of fossils that needed study. This opportunity became his greatest challenge and secured his professional future. If not for the theft, he wouldn't have known about this chance. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland, and instead focused on visiting the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. In his office at Oxford University, he mentions having ice cream made from bee larvae at home. Although they look like maggots, they taste 'slightly nutty and floral.' Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. His research is quietly influencing what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurant menus. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink, a field informally known as gastrophysics. They look at details like who we eat with, how food is presented, and even the background noise, as all these factors affect taste. 

Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers many interesting insights for anyone who enjoys eating. For example, did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? 

Spence's lab in Oxford is quite simple, with soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less serious in universities. However, now that universities need to show their work has an impact, this type of research is more valued. Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often without customers noticing. They do it gradually so that people don't detect the change in taste. 

Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a big food company. At that time, people thought science and food didn't mix well, even though food is quite scientific. Blumenthal and Spence worked together on a dish called 'Sound of the Sea' at Blumenthal's restaurant. Interestingly, the Italian futurists were doing similar things with food and sound a century ago, but it didn't become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. For example, his research shows that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with the food they serve, and a brand released an app that plays music while your ice cream softens, although they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence often finds is the case.

At home, Spence's dinner parties are quite unique. Once, they ate rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. They've also experimented with different drinks and sounds to see how they affect taste. For Spence, home, shops, food events, and international conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, fake facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what is important and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows. Smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried something will fall. Even though we think we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can make our thinking unclear. Multitasking creates a craving for distraction, rewarding the brain for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain, is easily distracted by new things. This is ironic because it is the part we need to stay focused. Just having the chance to multitask can harm our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former professor of psychology, calls it info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an unread email is in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. The mental losses from multitasking are greater than those from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember. Multitasking also involves making decisions, like whether to answer a text or ignore it. Decision-making is hard on our brains, and small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones. After making many small decisions, we can make bad decisions about important things. In talking with business leaders, scientists, and writers, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not about email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other things done."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can't find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions would not have been considered important. Scientists focused on animal behaviors and their outcomes, not on whether animals have feelings or moral systems. But recently, this has started to change. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, such as Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate that science may never fully answer: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a conscience, a sense of right and wrong? 

In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Those that opened the gate themselves showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for how we produce and consume beef? The observations are clear, but their interpretation is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the brink of a major ethical change, similar to the end of slavery. Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, suggests we should rethink how we view animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler version of a theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail argues we should stop attributing human traits to animals. The disagreement is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is difficult, can we ever truly understand what it is like to be a bat, or a bat helping another bat give birth?

Balcombe describes an important experiment he conducted, which he believes shows that starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were divided into two groups. One group lived in spacious, comfortable cages, while the other group lived in small, bare cages. Both groups were initially fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and they learned to eat only from the tasty box. Later, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the birds in the comfortable cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that the birds in the poor conditions became pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, ""We look back with horror at times of racism. Our view on animals will be the same one day. We can't support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger."" If Balcombe were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. However, Professor Aubrey Manning shares his views. Manning, who wrote a textbook called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour,"" says, ""We are seeing a change. In the early 20th century, some people thought animals thought like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are moving in the opposite direction. But it is a controversial topic, and you want to avoid the noise of academics with personal grievances and strong opinions."""
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way of engaging with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K. and a former computer science lecturer, notes that people often believe argument helps find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there is concern that it changes how we solve complex problems and makes deep thinking harder. West points out that we are exposed to a lot of poor but appealing ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Interestingly, having more data and information doesn't necessarily lead to better knowledge or decisions. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, literary reading has decreased by 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media has a downside. She suggests that less reading might lead to a drop in critical thinking because people are more focused on real-time media and multitasking rather than concentrating on one thing. However, there is no clear answer yet on how technology affects critical thinking. The presence of technology has made it difficult for academics to rely on their previous beliefs. Technology can have both positive and negative effects, and different uses can lead to different outcomes. For example, a computer game might help or hinder critical thinking. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking on links might reduce deeper thinking.

Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how people think. She notes that reading enhances thinking and imagination in ways that video games and TV do not. Reading helps develop imagination, reflection, and critical thinking, as well as vocabulary. However, she also found that visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are real-time and don't allow time for reflection or imagination. As a result, many people, especially younger ones, may not reach their full potential.

How society views technology affects how it perceives critical thinking. This is especially true with video games and thinking skills. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video and computer games can be good for learning, despite some negative opinions. Evidence shows that games like Sim City and Civilization help develop decision-making and analytical skills in realistic virtual environments. These games allow players to explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise. In the digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and motorcycle mechanic. He left his office job because he was unhappy with it. His first book talked about the benefits of manual work, and his latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he noticed ads appearing on a credit card machine while he was shopping. Crawford realized that these ads were making it hard for us to focus on what we want to think about. We are often unaware of these distractions, which makes it difficult to remember conversations or think deeply. To avoid constant interruptions, people are becoming more isolated and less willing to talk to strangers.

Crawford points out that we often experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us. These things reflect our desires and can take over our attention. Many people are worried about this issue. For example, office workers complain about emails but then spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just having a phone on the table can distract us. Although there is no scientific proof that our attention spans are shorter, we are more aware of other things we could be doing.

Crawford believes that technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, it is hard to control ourselves, which affects our social lives. We prefer texting to talking because it feels safer. By only interacting with digital versions of people, we might lose important social skills. Crawford uses his gym as an example. It used to have one music player for everyone, which sometimes caused disagreements. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds, making the gym less social. He believes real connections happen when people work through differences together.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he thinks engaging in skilled activities can help us connect with the world. For example, cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers have to deal with real situations and use their judgment. These activities show that digital experiences can't replace real ones. Crawford says that focusing on real tasks makes digital distractions less appealing. He doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but that using our judgment is important. This focus not only brings professional satisfaction but also helps us concentrate better on what matters."
13,"Text: ""When people ask, 'What do you do for a living?' they usually expect a simple answer. But for me, as a philosopher, it's a bit more complicated. Calling myself a philosopher can sound arrogant because people might think I claim to know some special truth. This isn't true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this stereotype makes me pause. Why do people think this way about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others' actions and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of thinking was the best life. While few modern philosophers agree completely, philosophy is still linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, 'The unexamined life is not worth living.' He meant that just following cultural norms without thinking is unsatisfying. Reflecting on life helps us make our own choices. But examining life doesn't mean reading lots of philosophy books or spending all your time thinking. It means looking closely at our daily experiences to see if they are important. It doesn't require living apart from society. In fact, examining life is practical and should be shared because it's part of a good life. Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from everyday life. This isn't entirely philosophers' fault. Universities focus on funding and publishing in expensive journals, so philosophers often only talk to other experts. To outsiders, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. Many philosophers used to challenge this view, but now some accept it. Universities created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As philosophy becomes more focused on specific debates, explaining these ideas to non-experts is hard. Philosophy has, in some cases, withdrawn from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an 'ethicist' because I work in ethics, which is about evaluating human actions. But this title doesn't fully describe my work because ethics is often linked to rules and laws. Recently, ethics has come to mean applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if an action is 'ethical' or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often discuss them. But philosophy is more than that. A typical discussion might start with whether illegally downloading films is wrong (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people examine the actions and beliefs that shape their lives. Sometimes we confirm what we already know; other times, we find our beliefs are hard to justify. By examining these ideas, we contribute to everyone's benefit."""
14,"Food lovers, chefs, and others who value food might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, philosophers have often used food as a way to talk about other topics, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related ideas. 

Take the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, for example. He talked about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is now closely linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites, likely because businesses think it will help them sell more if people associate their products with famous philosophers.

Food is naturally social and cultural. It comes from historical backgrounds and is shared with people in our communities. These communities give us people to eat with and the systems to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than any other product, making it an interesting topic for philosophical study.

Once food is made, critics start talking and writing about it. But why do they have such a special role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, food critics are just better at describing tastes. Philosophically, the way we perceive taste hasn't been studied much, as most research has focused on vision, which should change.

Another part of food is its beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. However, food is eaten and disappears, unlike art or music, which last over time. So, some think food can't be considered a true object of beauty.

There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often show our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices, which is important for food discussions.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests because of personal relationships. At home, everyone is included in sharing food and friendship. Professional cooks have duties to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are only for qualified people, and their relationships are professional.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by enjoying others' food and by building personal connections through shared meals, a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy engaging for readers."
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were not exciting or challenging anymore. So, he thought about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices made in one game affect the next? He changed a classic game called Risk into a new version: Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at important moments. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau was then asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was praised, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was the first game not based on an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players become explorers in a new world. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. To do this, they use testers to see how the game plays out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said: ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.’

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a small interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is different and pretty good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks many rules. I thought it would be popular with only a few people. I thought I would be known for this unusual project.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He sees it as a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and you get that with legacy games.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the adventure of the game was more important than worries about its lasting value. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and damaging the board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It’s like the stories you get from video games.’ The legacy format is influenced by video games and the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV shows. Daviau once wanted to be a TV writer but moved to advertising and then game design. The love of storytelling stayed with him. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start,’ he said. ‘But you also need more than just an outline.’

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is interested in seeing how others develop the idea. But he also thinks people might soon ask: ‘What’s next?’ Colby Dauch, who manages the studio that published SeaFall, believes the legacy format is groundbreaking. ‘It changes how you think about what a board game can be,’ he said."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like something from a children's movie, was shared widely online. Stories like this are fun because they let us imagine animals as being like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very intelligent but look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

People often think that giving animals human-like qualities is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that the real problem is the opposite. He calls it ""anthropodenial,"" which means not recognizing the human-like traits in animals. By looking at animal-cognition research, he shows that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. In other words, animals are much smarter than we have given them credit for.

De Waal believes that ignoring animal intelligence is a modern idea. In the past, people thought animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said that the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. It focused on training animals with rewards and punishments, making people see animals as simple machines. Anyone who thought animals had inner lives was seen as unrealistic or unscientific. This change happened at the same time humans were destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.

Fortunately, de Waal thinks we are starting to see animal intelligence as similar to human intelligence, even if it's not the same. He notes that there is a lot of new information about animal intelligence available online. The best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts, while we need apps to find our phones. In her book, ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might judge us on how many color patterns we can make on our skin. Seeing us fail, it might think we are not very smart.

De Waal is doubtful about Inky's escape story. He thinks it's unlikely that Inky knew how to find a drain leading to the ocean. However, he understands that viral stories can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers (a food they like) and others got grapes (which they like more), the ones with cucumbers got upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but what really convinced people was a short video of the experiment released ten years later. This shows how our human minds work in interesting ways."
17,"Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialization. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for years, but experts say we are close to a big change where robots will be used in many more areas. However, many people are not ready for this change. Most people think robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, but they also believe their own jobs will still exist. This is not true; robotic automation will affect every industry soon. 

For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a job that would take two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a startup called Simbe Robotics introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check if products are stocked and priced correctly. 

Supporters of robotic automation say that robots still need humans to service and program them, which will create new, high-skilled jobs. Critics, however, worry that we are not ready for the loss of human interaction in jobs. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will start making laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but there will be a lack of skilled workers.

Dr. Zhang believes that people with lower skills will be most affected by automation. He suggests that they should retrain themselves instead of relying on the government to protect their jobs. New developments in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, like robots that live with us at home and interact with us in advanced ways. This presents a big opportunity for companies but also challenges, such as creating new rules to protect our safety and privacy.

With many jobs at risk, education is key to preparing for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive in a changing job market."
18,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered the question of why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response highlights a common curiosity: why do people risk their lives for something that seems pointless? Mallory's answer might inspire some to follow their dreams, as it challenges people to face the unknown. The real value of his answer is its simplicity, suggesting that climbing might just be about adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules, from bouldering to climbing Himalayan peaks. He argued that the style of climbing, like using more or less equipment, should match the rules of the specific climbing activity. Over the years, this idea has become very influential in Western climbing culture, appearing in magazines and discussions.

For many climbers, the love of climbing comes from the sense of freedom it gives. However, climbing can also be limiting, like when climbers are stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. But some argue that the simplicity of having limited choices is a form of freedom itself.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective in his essay. He suggests asking ""Why do people climb?"" instead of just ""Why climb?"" Fitschen believes climbing is part of our nature, an evolutionary trait that drives us to take on challenges and push limits, even with risks. The joy of climbing, then, is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor adds another view, saying climbing helps develop virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor thinks they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing can help people develop qualities that are useful in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who don't rely on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson stirred controversy by suggesting that independent climbs deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or artificial aids like bottled oxygen. Their essay may have encouraged some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Finally, looking beyond Western ideas, climbing involves being in the moment and solving problems intuitively. This experience is similar to Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This connection offers another reason why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known as an intellectual and sometimes serious person who focused on European piano music. He wrote and performed a lot but rarely taught. People close to him saw a fun side, but this was not often shown in his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take this request seriously. He had taught very few students and saw no reason to start now. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, ""You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk."" However, something about Kit, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played very well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital he had performed. Brendel thought, ""I have to make time for him."" Kit's performance was exceptional, showing a rare understanding and subtlety.

As Brendel steps back from public life, Kit is starting to make his mark, though Brendel is careful to ensure Kit does not burn out. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under the watchful eye of his mother. He also composes music. Brendel says, ""Learning to read music is easier if you try to write it yourself."" He noticed Kit has an amazing memory and is a great sight reader. More importantly, Kit listens to his own playing and understands Brendel's instructions. When Brendel points out something in a piece, Kit applies it throughout the piece.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations. He is upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, saying it is harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit plays some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

At 80, Brendel reflects on his life. He says, ""When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them, but there was still room for more, so I continued. Although I don’t have the physical strength now, my mind is still active with music I’ve never played. I don’t perform anymore, but it’s a nice new phase in my life."""
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden wasn’t in a dirty city. It was by a river and gently sloped down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places of peace and quiet. Grandad’s garden wasn’t special in terms of features. He didn’t have a greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass had broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He wasn’t without humor, though. Silly things amused him, and he liked using certain phrases, like ‘It’s immaterial to me’. He probably felt disappointed that he hadn’t achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn’t passionate about. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was very skilled at home repairs, like building bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother liked changing furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I did like the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; lessons were for my sister. When I asked my mother later why I didn’t get lessons, she said, ‘You’d never have practiced’.

Of the three places – moors, woods, or river – I usually chose the river. I could escape into another world there. With a fishing net and old sandals, I’d walk along the riverbank, find a spot, and take off my sandals. I’d look for fish to catch with my net. After failing to keep them alive at home, I’d return them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father said, ‘There’s an apprentice gardener job in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, Dad went against his usual thinking. He might have preferred me to be a carpenter, but I like to think he believed things might work out if I stuck with it. Maybe I’m fooling myself, but I prefer to believe that deep down, even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw my passion for it."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on the Isle of Muck, a small Scottish island. I do the same because a strong Atlantic wind could blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. Lawrence's sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and Lawrence gently pets him. Despite the strong wind, Lawrence feels completely at home on his island. He points out the nearby islands, shouting over the wind, ""That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do."" I see heavy clouds pouring rain on Rum's mountains. ""Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay,"" he adds.

When rain starts coming our way, Lawrence says he needs to move his sheep. As we walk down the slopes, he tells me about the island: Muck is volcanic, three kilometers long and half as wide. The geese eat a lot of grass, and the MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. Our conversation pauses as Tie, the sheepdog, tries to herd the sheep but struggles. ""Away to me, Tie,"" Lawrence calls, meaning the dog should go to the right. Tie doesn't listen and goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. ""Tie,"" Lawrence says, sounding disappointed. The dog looks ashamed.

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny. Their son, Colin, takes care of the island cottages, and their daughter, Mary, runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. ""They go out and come back only when they're hungry,"" Mary says. However, island life has its challenges. Electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, Mary prepares breakfast by torchlight. I get used to it, along with having no mobile phone service. ""There is mobile reception on the hill,"" Mary tells me. ""Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer."" So I do the same.

Life on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. The boat today brings groceries and three musicians with their instruments. Their concert in the island's tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their boots to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire while it rains outside, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ""Her father bought a small farm on the Isle of Soay from a newspaper ad without seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it."" Did Jenny know anything about farming? ""She had good typing skills,"" Lawrence laughs.

I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary, who cooks it for dinner. By 7 pm, the fish is on the table, and it tastes amazing. The next morning, I am supposed to take a ferry to another island. However, many ferries have been canceled in the past two months due to rough seas. If my ferry doesn't come, I will be stuck on Muck for two more days, which, despite the lack of phone service, I secretly hope for."
22,"The game design industry used to be mainly for computer scientists and self-taught people, and there weren't many ways to get into it. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now the video games industry is taken seriously. Industry experts aren't surprised by this change. However, it's not easy to enter the industry. Video game spin-offs from new movies need many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like most industries, it's hard to break into, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, who speaks for an online games magazine, says it's tough to make progress in big companies or influence major games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever, not just directors but also those who design systems and specific parts of games.

So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer candidates with a computer science degree, but Jim disagrees. He says the only way is to make games. The tools are available, and you need to create something to get a job. Game design is more a lifestyle than just a job. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real. Another expert, John Field, sees other options. He agrees with ""just doing it,"" but says it's more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry's requirements. Even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and business ability to contribute to this evolving field.

Can you succeed on your own? ""Maybe, but it's quite difficult,"" says John. A good postgraduate course in games can help and provide support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and have a strong interest in arts and contemporary culture. They might have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and understand the growing variety of the medium. Connections are also important. Networking is crucial to get ahead in games, as in many other fields.

The old stereotype of a teenage boy playing video games has changed. Now, games are seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is a lot of room for growth. Games have become popular with large audiences and are a great way to learn. He sees this already big area as full of possibilities and opportunities."
23,"Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me, but he didn't force me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It's only by practicing that you can score impressive goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I try to show them how to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope that when he kicks the books around, it doesn't mean he's like me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so younger players like me could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never told us, 'This is your big chance,' but we knew it was. Even though I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely a lot on close friends and family. Having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. People sometimes say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' Of course, I've helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would be offended if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I enjoy using my money to make life easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I think I'll take a year off or maybe longer to do things I haven't been able to do. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father couldn't write anything good while we were in Los Angeles, so Sam, worried about losing clients and money, offered to find us a cheap place to live. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn't popular with day-trippers. The road was not appealing, and the nearby resort, La Carmella, was more attractive for those with some money. Only people who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, the place filled with people. After months of being almost alone, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to meet a writing deadline and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty, without him noticing. We didn't have a dog when we first moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to adopt us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him water. My father half-heartedly threw a boot at him, but Rusty knew he wasn't serious and stayed closer. I asked my father who Rusty might belong to, and he said, ""You're wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes, he brought things he hadn't dug up, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, we had been swimming. My father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon together. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed tireless. One surfer stood out with her graceful style. She decided to finish for the day and rode a final wave to the shore. She greeted me and asked why I hadn't joined them. I told her I didn't have a surfboard and no money to buy one. She noticed I was British and asked if I was visiting. I explained that I lived there because my father was writing a film script. She asked if she knew him and I said his name was Rufus Marsh. When I mentioned his book, ""Tall as the Morning,"" she showed more interest. I realized people were friendly but only really interested when I mentioned my father's book."
25,"Violet Hetherington was in a long, slow-moving line at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline cruise ship. Her friend Annie, who often traveled, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this advice turned out to be wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers explained that there was a problem with the computer system, which made the passengers frustrated. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service.

Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. This was more upsetting than the long wait because she couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left it in the cab. All her important phone numbers were stored in the phone, something her older son Harry had warned her about. She asked a friendly couple behind her in line if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message, asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at her apartment. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble contacting people in New York.

Finally, the line started moving, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy, with fake wood panels, lots of chandeliers, shiny brass, and airport-style carpets. She followed signs to the elevators, which were crowded with tired passengers. The mirrors inside showed everyone's reflections, which wasn't comforting.

Violet was squeezed against the side of the elevator as it stopped at each floor, letting people out. At last, she reached the twelfth floor and felt relieved to find her room had the balcony she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn't. Ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal, Violet had paid the highest price she could afford to ensure she had a view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he didn't realize he was uncovering the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for pictures for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing interesting scenes. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof stood among all these items, realizing he had stumbled upon something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ For a while now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together the details of Maier’s life. They reached out to local families who hired her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit eccentric, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, wide-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although she wasn’t very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed to be quite passionate about her ‘second job’, documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was done for money. Her photos often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or did she borrow ideas from those who came before her?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I progressed as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. However, this isn't true for Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries. I spoke with her in the UK when her book was very popular, and she was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who then asked, ""What's it about?"" This is a tough question for any author. 

The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. It involves a series of crimes and a group of 12 men trying to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found that the past allowed for more complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention.

When I asked her how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said it's nice coming from a small country because everyone shares in the success. She mentioned getting a lot of support from people back home. She also said it bothers her when people don't see her book as a serious work. Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part being half the length of the previous one. This makes the book feel like it speeds up as you read. She said it doesn't matter if readers notice this, but if they do, they can see the patterns.

Despite its unique structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, Catton didn't plan the story in advance. She would write herself into difficult situations and then find creative ways to resolve them. One of her goals was to make the book enjoyable for readers.

We also talked about her love for TV drama series. The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue, similar to TV shows. I asked if she would be interested in writing for TV, and she said it could be fun. She spoke with enthusiasm and a warm laugh. She is passionate about her work and New Zealand. She noticed how her imagination changes when she travels to different places, like Britain. She understands why some writers leave New Zealand for busier places, but for now, she plans to stay in New Zealand. Many people, including me, hope it continues to inspire her future novels."
28,"When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he loved using tools in his dad’s garage and playing with a guitar. These two hobbies have been his job for the last forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. Jonny says, ‘I’m still amazed by the guitar. How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? And how do different types of wood create different sounds? It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a summer job to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you wanted something, you should make it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and woods affected the sound and how to build them.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny made from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ‘We designed model boats and planes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use saws and sharpen chisels. I also fixed and customized instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a career. ‘I was also interested in painting and sculpture,’ he says. After finishing school, he decided to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he remembers. But halfway through the course, he left. ‘I was too independent for it,’ he says. ‘But I left with a better idea of what I wanted to do. I was still interested in sculpture, but I realized that making guitars is like sculpting sound. I thought it might be more practical than pure art because you’re making things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. At first, he sold guitars for just the cost of the materials, but as he became known as a top guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just getting by’. He admits he can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to get noticed. He went to music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his guitars – when musicians asked, he didn’t have an answer because it wasn’t natural for him to think about money. Jonny believes it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the best acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t considered the real thing, even though we’ve always had good courses and the skills have stayed the same. But now, our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says you can learn valuable techniques in classes, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take courses. However, he also believes there’s no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If someone else teaches you, you only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’"
29,"When talking about English conversation, it often starts with the weather. This is a tradition, and many writers mention the famous comment by Dr. Johnson from the 18th century: ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This is still true today. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why English people are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They fail because they think that when English people talk about the weather, they are really interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not exciting, so he finds it strange that English people talk about it so much. He notes that England doesn’t have extreme weather like tornadoes or blizzards. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you can never be sure what the weather will be like. 

My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the point. English people don’t talk about the weather because they are interested in it. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to start conversations and connect with each other. Phrases like ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ or ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ are not really about the weather. They are like greetings or ways to start a conversation. This is similar to how monkeys and apes groom each other to bond socially. 

There are specific times when English people use weather-talk. Some writers say that English people talk about the weather all the time, but this is not true. There are three main situations for weather-talk: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or to fill in awkward silences. This means there is a lot of weather-talk, so people from other countries might think English people are obsessed with the weather. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, use more weather-talk to break the ice, and then return to weather-talk if there is a pause in the conversation. This is why people think English people talk about the weather a lot."
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how impressive it was for the Romans to build a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were already interested because they chose this trip over more glamorous ones to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not satisfying. When she couldn't find a historical novel to give more context and interest to life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching in 2001, Alice started a new career as an author. 

Alice found writing both exciting and a bit scary, but it was less tiring than teaching. Her former colleagues envied her because she still connected with children through her books. Alice's main goal for her novels is to fill a gap in children's fiction. She noticed that many books for teenagers focus on negative experiences or are complete fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are different. Alice always taught English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel ""Tale of Troy,"" and she loves seeing children go from being bored to interested. She sees her writing as a continuation of her teaching.

Alice was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher also suggested she would enjoy a creative writing course. At first, Alice was surprised and didn't want to spend her summer on a course she thought unnecessary. But she had to send her best piece of fiction to be accepted. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby, and was accepted into the course. During the course, other students gave her great feedback and suggested she publish her story. With only school report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, a critic and editor, helped her a lot with editing. Alice says they complement each other well; he helps improve her writing by suggesting changes, while she likes to add more scenes."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to compete in a special race. The race would be between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

""I'm looking forward to it,"" Jonny said at the start line. ""I've never done anything like this before; it's exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it's very cold right now, so I'll be warm in the car."" Alistair was also excited. Unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, Alistair was dressed in full winter cycling gear. He wasn't worried about the cold. ""To be honest,"" he said, ""I've seen his driving before, so I'm not sure he'll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, which is about 350 meters up. This might not be a problem for the car, but Alistair's first few miles included a steep 25 percent incline, making it tough for him from the start. After a quick handshake, they began. Alistair sped off on his bike, heading up a hill and then across the countryside to Fleet Moss. Jonny got into the car and was soon on the road. The next time they would see each other would be at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?

Jonny's early confidence was quickly challenged. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first obstacle: a giant tractor came out of a field and onto the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he joked to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it's because of this farmer!"" After dealing with the tractor, Jonny was back on track, driving into the morning mist.

Meanwhile, Alistair was struggling with the steep slope. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched curiously as the Olympic champion kept moving, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out, he had a chance to show his skills. He put his head down, feet on the pedals, and started picking up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another local challenge. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have been around since before cars were invented, and the roads are not made for speed. Jonny carefully navigated a very narrow corner and drove through a stream on the road. Once past the last village, he raced straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping, he reached the line and stopped. 

Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, ""Is he here?"" When they said no, he raised his arms in victory. ""Yes!"" he shouted. Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car and got out. ""Well done,"" Jonny said, feeling disappointed. ""I'm gutted."""
32,"Playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a unique experience because of the silence. When you bounce the ball on the soft grass, you hear only the sound of your own shots. The well-kept grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful audience create a special atmosphere that feels separate from the outside world. This quiet helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to block out everything except the game and the point I'm playing. The silence is only broken by applause and cheers when a point is won. Even though there are 15,000 people watching in the stadium and millions more on TV, I am so focused that I hardly notice them. 

In 2008, I played against Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final, the biggest match of my life. I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, who has been my coach forever, taught me that Wimbledon is the most important tournament. By age 14, I was already telling my friends that I would play and win there one day. Before 2008, I had played and lost twice to Federer in the finals. The 2006 loss wasn't too hard because I was just happy to have reached the final at age 20. But the 2007 loss was devastating because I knew I could have done better. It wasn't my skills that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that match. Losing is always painful, but it's worse when you know you had a chance to win. 

Toni, who is a very tough coach, usually doesn't comfort me, even when I win. But after that loss, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances to win Wimbledon. I told him he didn't understand, that it might have been my last chance. I know a professional athlete's career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I felt I had missed a big one in 2007. 

However, Toni was right. I got another chance in 2008. I was confident I had learned from my previous defeat and that my mindset would be strong this time. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends, but we didn't talk about the match. They knew I was already mentally preparing for it, and I needed that space to be mine alone until the match started."
33,"In early April 1957, a young and idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. 

In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society helped make Jane Goodall famous by creating articles and TV documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages and is still available today. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes hides her real achievements. Many stories about her life focus on her adventurous spirit or her role as a woman in a male-dominated field, which can overshadow her actual work.

Jane Goodall should be recognized as a leading pioneer in her field and the world's top zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew they ate meat or used tools, and we didn't realize they had emotions and social systems similar to ours. We also didn't know that chimpanzee communities across Africa have different cultural traditions. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is the most important work in chimpanzee research. Her long-term study of wild apes in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements of the Western world.

Jane Goodall changed how we study animals, and because chimpanzees are our closest relatives, she also changed how we think about ourselves. Even as a child, there were signs of the person she would become. One clear example was in the autumn of 1939 when she was five years old. One day, Jane disappeared, and the police, neighbors, and family searched for her. As it got dark, she suddenly reappeared with straw in her hair and clothes. Her mother asked where she had been, and Jane explained that she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. She had hidden in a henhouse for five hours to find out. This curiosity can be seen as the start of her career as a biologist."
34,"Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist who can speak in many different voices. During our first conversation, she used the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV, cartoons, and health and safety training videos. She recently did a voiceover about back injuries and had to quickly learn how to say many medical terms.

Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. Many actors think they can do funny voices, and some can, but there is more to it. You have to make the script come alive for an audience that can’t see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceover work, but they often don’t get the parts because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.

After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning to have a regular acting career. During the course, she sang jingles for TV ads. One day, the studio manager suggested she try out for a rabbit character in a cartoon. It seemed silly, but she tried it for fun and got a major part. Shirley realized she was good at voices and decided to pursue voiceover work. In her second film, she played the main character, her brother, and her mother.

Adult female actors often provide voices for young boys and girls because their voices are lighter. Hiring child actors involves complex procedures, which production companies prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create different sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are her favorite part of a job that also includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. She says those are tough because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but smiling while talking helps make your voice sound cheerful.

The competition for voiceover work is tough, and having a good showreel is important. A showreel is a recording that shows what an artist can do. Shirley says it’s worth investing in a strong showreel, and there are agencies that help voiceover artists create them. She believes her success is due to persistence as much as talent. Whether it’s making your showreel or practicing your voices, it’s about setting goals and not giving up.

For those interested in a voiceover career, Shirley recommends attending specialist workshops that cover all types of voiceover work. She also believes a love for human sound is essential. She describes herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she performs. After doing a particular voice in the studio, she might speak like that for hours or even days. Her children are used to their mom talking in different voices."
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a dream job for many kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more practical careers, like becoming a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. 

In my case, I had a typical cartoonist’s childhood: I loved comic strips, contributed to school publications, and was known as ‘the kid who draws.’ I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and in a few months, I was earning enough to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are basic, but it’s still a tough job. You shouldn’t try to become a cartoonist unless you feel you can’t do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t refuse any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are mostly over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create and sell your work. Cartoonists with average talent but good business skills often do better than artistic geniuses who lack those skills.

I often meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they won’t even show their work to others! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it’s not a disaster—it could actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of those things was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black guitar made in Japan. Normally, I hate throwing things away, but for some reason, I decided to get rid of it. I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man approached me, looking confused. He asked, ""Are you really going to throw that away?"" I said yes, even though I was starting to regret it. He asked if he could have it, and I agreed. We went our separate ways, but I felt sad about my decision for years.

Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish he was eating. The email was from a man named Keith Rushton, who restores guitars. He told me, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back of the guitar. He realized it was probably outdated but used my name to find me online. He eventually contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell the guitar back to me. I was so emotional and would have paid anything, but his price was fair.

I had forgotten that my dad used to put name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have found this whole situation funny. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s because it was popular then. I loved the calming sound of the classical guitar, but I didn't make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn't need to be a great musician to be a rock star.

When I got my old guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I felt the urge to stand up and play it with a strap over my shoulder, as electric guitars are meant to be played. My fingers remembered the chords, even though I couldn't draw them. My fingertips felt the familiar pain of pressing the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really for playing alone, so now that I'm learning it again, I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are others my age with similar experiences. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" which is about people who can't sleep well, I felt like I was the only one talking about how dangerous not getting enough sleep can be. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who struggle with sleep know how important it is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them in these discussions. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, missing the last hour or two of sleep. This is usually the REM stage, or 'Rapid Eye Movement,' which is when we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives to 90 will spend six or seven years dreaming. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests that dreams are important. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who thought that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research didn't fully support this idea. The study of dreams shifted to focus more on their physical origins rather than psychological ones. Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He concluded that people who are interested in creativity use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't all people, like teachers, software designers, and politicians, need to think creatively? According to Stickgold, dreams help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create new ideas that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ignore the obvious and make unexpected connections, which is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, or one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come so quickly that I can barely type fast enough. I don't know exactly how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and we all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, which has a beautiful view of the sea, you can see empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading figure in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate famous paintings from artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so accurate that even art experts sometimes think they are the originals. While the original paintings are worth millions, Susie's reproductions sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them.

Susie has many clients, including galleries and private collectors, but she doesn't usually reveal their names. Some collectors buy her copies to show off, like a celebrity who claims to own a Van Gogh when it's actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. Some people use her copies to save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank and displaying her copy at home.

Susie is honest about her work. She tries to make her reproductions look as real as possible and signs her name on the back of the canvas. Selling a copy as an original is illegal, and although some people do it, Susie has never been tempted because it could ruin her reputation. She admits she isn't wealthy and has had tough times, but her situation is more stable now.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. This job taught her to be precise and careful, which helped her in her current work. She advises young artists to learn to draw accurately and study hard. Susie can create anything from plant drawings to perfect copies of old masterpieces, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas.

Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie disagrees. She says impressionists painted quickly but were also very detailed, which is hard to achieve. Despite her skills, Susie doesn't create her own original art. She once tried painting fishing nets, but they looked too much like photographs. Susie is a perfectionist and is happy with her career as a copyist."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest sailor. From a young age, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a strong connection with the boats she sailed around the world, working in perfect harmony with them. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly longed to be back at sea, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places.

After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop race around the world, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was a small, cramped space where she lived and worked for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even down to the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she would need. Preparation was crucial. She proudly displayed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her boat was her entire world, and she took great care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her realize how humans take what they want and move on. 

When I visited Ellen’s office, she had just finished a heated conference call. She explained why urgent action is needed to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways to not use them up,"" she said. Initially, her message was to use less, but she now focuses on re-using, like promoting reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, Ellen has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she admits, ""but I love learning. The current situation is something I can't ignore. Sailing seemed selfish in comparison. This is about finding how my voice can be most useful. It really matters.""

Ellen also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to create a sustainable future. ""I miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It defines who I am. At sea, you are connected to everything around you, focused on records, practicalities, and survival. My new message isn't as simple as saying, 'I’m going to be the fastest around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I've done before."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous among teenagers. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to encourage them to try outdoor activities. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, which are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

I talked to some experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agreed that a young climber might be physically strong enough, but they were unsure if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also doubted that a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that – there's still a lot to do. We think about the risks, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow stronger gives me confidence.'

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it just his father's ambition? Paul says, 'This isn't about me wanting fame through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later in life, but we decided, why not now? We regularly check with him to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record attempt. The more exciting the record, the more interest it gets. This creates a challenge for Jordan. People might say that focusing on records takes away from the enjoyment, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something impressive, like climbing Everest. Paul adds, 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we'll end this project and go to the gym.'"
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they aren't listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but even my classmates don't know much about classical music. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't own their music. The numbers are discouraging for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells just 300 copies. I find that surprising. So, why is interest in classical music declining, even though it's been around for centuries? Older people often blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who love classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big classical music fan. I like many music styles, but my classical music collection is probably around that 3% mark. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm, with many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk, play, and think fast. Experts say we can't focus for more than about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for pop songs. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop songs also have lyrics that are more interesting to us than long classical pieces without words. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people are going to classical concerts now, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why more people like classical concerts as they get older, but I do know that if your parents love something, you might avoid it. Some people blame schools for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play in their school orchestra. They practice early and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy classical music when they perform, but it's not their first choice when listening for fun. When we relax, we usually choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you regret that I’m here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too, so she didn’t hear Bonnie, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t seem to expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be kicked out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best one here!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He seemed lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They must be nearby."" The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, which made Bonnie happy. She was so focused on putting a saddle on Maverick that she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m serious because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She got him to walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The movement was exciting, and the breeze made her cheeks glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he’d be good at jumping."
43,"I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. Cody is a 15-year-old Australian who has already released several successful songs. How did a relaxed surfer end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" He remembers that he was also swimming and surfing every day, which were more important to him back then. At 13, while attending high school, he posted a few videos online. These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos on their social media. Cody, who had recorded more videos at home, was happy to share them. The responses were overwhelming. Cody was also a talented swimmer, training with top coaches and focusing on his sport. But then record labels showed interest, and he had a tough decision to make: stay in Australia and continue swimming or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very difficult for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career,"" he says. ""Can you imagine, at 12 or 13, trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked reactions. ""I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody says it’s important to have a close group of great people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, everyone has days of doubt. ""Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight and travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about how that affects him, but my family always reassures me that they’re here to support and encourage me."" Success, in any career, comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to your big opportunity, even when it’s a bit scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be visiting countries I never thought I’d see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to stop the buildings from flooding when the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags into place. Last week, I worked with most of the town's adults for long hours to show I could do it. But my grandfather didn't seem to notice. With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the wood factory in Milltown. There was fragile ice on both sides, and solid ice downstream. As I changed out of my pajamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn't know him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip, which I read before bed. I patted the chain and went to the kitchen. ""Morning, Rex,"" Mom said with a smile as I took a banana from the counter. ""You're up early for a Saturday. I'll make brunch after your training. Be careful."" ""Thanks, Mom."" I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa. ""Watch where you're going,"" he shouted. ""Where are you going?"" ""Sorry, Grandpa. I'm going kayaking."" My wetsuit should have made that clear. He sees me kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore his temper, but it's getting harder. ""Why train? You didn't win the competition,"" he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom gave me a sympathetic smile. ""Don't mind him. He's..."" ""…not himself right now,"" I finished. I didn't say he's always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a kid, he was my hero. He showed me photos of himself in National Geographic. Those photos are still on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don't go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now, and maybe one day, my own photo in National Geographic. Still, part of me wants to stay loyal to him, even though he's grumpy. Mom smiled. ""At least he's coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your dedication, even on cold days!"" I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ""It'll be warmer in South America,"" I said. ""If I find sponsors for my expedition."" She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I hurried to the boathouse in the backyard."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unfinished painting by Grandpa. It was different from his usual work. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. It showed a river, but not one she recognized. It might not even be a real river, just an imaginary one. The picture was strange and shapeless, but beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green, drawing the eye into the pale waters and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, too detached, showing her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? I mean, for him to be so specific. Still, he hasn't finished it yet, so maybe he's going to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't resist. It's such an unusual picture, especially having a name. I suppose you can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone..."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""... every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually to say the muse wasn't being kind to him that day, or that he had to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I will cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm unlucky that way.

What I was really trying to do was find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's very cute, small, painted white with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it, like shepherdesses and milkmaids. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet, so I was excited when she gave it to me. But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it has to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But since Angela is only fifteen, I'll be in my small room for a while. I don't mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest, and I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom... Then I thought, if I can't cut the cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me because he always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of a house. They 'borrow' things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be difficult to meet fans' expectations. People who love the book have strong opinions about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' point of view, not the humans', which made filming more complicated. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so when we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' perspective. They wore out many pairs of jeans doing this! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was making the shadows look right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series aired, famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I especially remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so scary they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me was getting the costumes right, which other directors struggled with. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it almost impossible for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and had to be sewn into the dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most scenes away from the Borrowers’ home were shot with actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren’t accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists, but there are none. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, people pretending to be friends, and the requests for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. “Everything’s going to be fine,” I reassure her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life of traveling and tutors. While the band is here for recording, we’re staying permanently. I chose this school because I want to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal. 

I walk into the school’s main office. “Hi, I need my schedule, please,” I say to the secretary. “Name?” she asks, not very friendly. “Desert McGraw.” “Desirée?” she asks, leaning closer. “Desert,” I repeat. She seems confused but types “McGraw” on her keyboard. Luckily, not many people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. “What grade?” “Eleventh.” “One second, it’s printing,” she says, then hands me the schedule. English Literature is my first class. I like English, so that’s good. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night to avoid looking lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already calling roll. “Aurelio Gonzalez.” “Here.” I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles and looks at my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. Perfect, no one will suspect anything! “Nice shoes,” she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oops, maybe not the best choice. “Thanks,” I say. The teacher pauses. “Desert... McGraw?” she asks. “Here.” She smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After discussing the books we’ll read this year, she lets us socialize. All teachers should do this. “So why’d you move here?” my new friend asks. I have options. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? “We need a change, Desert,” he said, “and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.” Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose a studio near the sand? “My dad had to relocate,” I tell her. A little lie works for now. “What does he do?” she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But I can pretend to be normal for a while. “He’s an artist,” I say, playing with my backpack zipper. “Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.” She doesn’t seem too interested. Perfect."
49,"The average American teenage girl today is expected to do a lot. She should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what being a teenager in America is like now. Teenagers can't just go to school and be average; they need to stand out. Being average is not enough, and not having big goals is seen as being lazy. 

Teenager Kristen Loose explains that people, especially adults, often forget how much pressure teenagers face today. They have lots of homework, tests, activities outside of school, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. On top of all this, they try to have a social life. Even though these pressures are normal for teenagers now, negative stereotypes about them still exist. The media often portrays teenagers as lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might fit this description, it's not fair to say all teenagers are like this.

Kristen Loose says that many people think teenagers spend most of their time watching TV or using their phones. She believes this is mostly wrong. She admits she keeps her phone close most of the time, but not just for fun. It's a tool that helps teenagers manage their busy lives. Today, students are expected to have instant access to information and be reachable at all times, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their work anywhere. They might listen to language lessons instead of music on the way to school. Schoolwork and activities now need attention all day, adding to teenagers' busy schedules.

Many teenagers start their day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20% of teenagers get enough sleep. Also, 28% of teenagers said they fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are so tired.

Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen doesn't spend much of this time on social media or TV. She uses it to volunteer. She says people think teenagers only care about themselves, but she loves helping others. Her favorite part of the week is volunteering, where she makes a positive impact in her school and community.

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers might change, but they will still be proving it wrong and making progress. There will be a new generation of students making a big impact before they even finish school."
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live near Bishop, a small town in the US surrounded by wilderness, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the past few years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a long-term science project with a twist: it's part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside was a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer to track temperature changes. Two GPS trackers were on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, was used to inflate the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy had driven seven hours to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it was time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chanted, and the balloon started rising. Some of them ran and tracked it with powerful flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was a quiet, shared sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, looking at the clear sky, hard to believe it was just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and quickly fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor shot across the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon expands until it’s almost the size of a house. Then it bursts in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helps the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day, using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who noted they’ve lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to reach it, the recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side of the mountains. Then they had to decide whether to drive or walk – it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. ‘It’s important to remember that these students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What seems wild and dangerous to some is just a way of life to others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but it was also a chance to discuss the effects of atmospheric waves and how they might work above mountain ridges. And it was another adventure story to share with others."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that she wasn't interested in science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. Her interest started by accident. Her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, a common phase for kids, which she hadn't gone through. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. It amazed her, and she realized she wanted to pursue it.

I asked Chloe about the support she received because Palaeontology wasn't a typical career choice for young people then. She remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. Chloe was nervous, worried he might find her annoying with her questions. However, he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

I mentioned how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe thinks films like Jurassic Park have increased interest in dinosaurs but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She feels that palaeontologists in movies are often shown as either eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks, which isn't accurate. Her job involves digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs, analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific journals. She also believes in communicating scientific findings to the public, especially young people, to clear up misunderstandings about science and inspire them.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, which aimed to show dinosaurs accurately. She advised the makers, ensuring the dinosaurs were the right size and from the same time period. The show attracted audiences of all ages because it portrayed dinosaurs more realistically than movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe believes dinosaurs fascinate us because they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. In a world that feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us there's still much to learn. Palaeontology, she says, is like a form of time travel."
52,"I'm going to say this just once: when you're traveling by car with your family, even if you're six years old, you probably know you're not ""there yet,"" even if you keep asking, ""Are we there yet?"" And really, once you arrive, it's not ""there"" anymore; it's ""here."" So, if you think you might be ""there,"" you should ask, ""Are we here yet?"" I'm sure no one wants to be ""there"" more than the parents who hear that question over and over during long car trips. Seriously, what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs you haven't seen, listen to music, or do puzzles you've had for a while, while the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, there's mom or dad, who gives out juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio station, and adjusts the temperature—basically, they make sure everything goes smoothly and act like a concierge on the road! Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying—like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. What? He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it's his other foot, then a hand, and soon he's in my space, and a fight starts. The driver and co-pilot reach back to separate us as the car speeds up and swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a while. The beautiful scenery continues to pass by. Soon after, I'm trying to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. But the car isn't going fast, and the window isn't open. Where's it coming from? My brother is in the next seat, quietly blowing air on me. He's on his side, not touching me, so he's technically not doing anything wrong. Just breathing? What's the problem with that? The anger builds. Tim gets yelled at, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again—for now. Over the years, Dad has come up with ways to handle us kids in the back seat. For example, when we ask, ""Are we there yet?"" he often says, ""Yes. We're here. Get out of the car."" ""But Dad, we're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour."" ""Oh, well, then maybe we're not there yet."" That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you're finally ""there"" when the adults get out of the car and move as far away as they can from the kids who have annoyed them for hours. So remember: if mom and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you're not there yet."
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope customers will love the experience and come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a space where people can connect without screens, as everyone is often busy with their phones and gadgets. The games in their café are called 'Eurogames', which have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone involved until the end. This idea was improved in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. 

One popular co-operative Eurogame is Pandemic, created by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He remembers playing it with friends and feeling scared but excited, and everyone felt good at the end, win or lose. Leacock loved board games since childhood, even though he often felt disappointed by them. With his uncle's help, he started designing better games. Pandemic became very successful, and its sequel added more storytelling, similar to video games, where characters develop and the world changes.

Interestingly, the growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games. Video games have made playing games more normal, as many people now play games on their smartphones. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, says that video games and board games have learned a lot from each other. Many people who play video games are now open to playing board games too. 

In the past, video games allowed people to play together in the same room, but now many games are played online, where players are not physically together. This has led some people to look for games they can play with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun; it brings people together in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."

His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many setbacks. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. Growing up, he only listened to a local radio station for middle-aged people, which influenced his music taste. He was 12 when he first heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between playing tennis at a national level and music, as he spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. He says, ""I was good at tennis, but it wasn't what I wanted to do forever. It was too much hard work."" At 17, he left school to pursue a music career. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as passionate about a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to be a musician, explaining that he wrote lyrics during economics lessons and played the piano daily. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend. Eventually, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he switched to another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune didn't come. Jamie says, ""In my artist career, I've often been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, I've been in the right place."" Writing for others became his strength. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK, helping new artists start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that aiming for chart success is okay. He asks, ""Don't you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?"" He believes in writing songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well. Jamie is straightforward about wanting to write hit songs that reach number one. He isn't arrogant; he just knows he has a talent for it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on writing great music. ""When I go into the studio, the goal is to write the best music of next year. It's not just about being cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs,"" he says."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online but might be unknown to people who don't watch videos of bike stunts. He is a 'street trials cyclist,' which means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. 

When I met him for an interview at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, many local boys recognized him. Even older people came to say he is a 'legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity, even though I was skeptical at first. Before each stunt, he explained what he planned to do, and I often doubted he could succeed. But he always did. When I praised him, he seemed uninterested and a bit sad. Despite his online fame, Tony doesn't enjoy being a celebrity. He finds it hard to socialize and prefers doing things rather than talking about them. 

This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. He admits that this technology helps him make a living. He sometimes feels that everyone is too focused on cameras and screens, but he doesn't complain. Thanks to his videos, he earns well from what would have been just a hobby in the past.

From my experience interviewing top athletes, I know that two things are important for success: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent and help athletes keep going despite failures. In risky sports, mental strength is crucial. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on easy but new obstacles. He just got up and tried again until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he takes unnecessary risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport. They probably never rode a trials bike and don't know the technical details. He gets expert advice to minimize risks. Tony is careful about the dangers. He believes it's wise to be aware of them. Some people never feel scared, but Tony feels fear and overcomes it. He is not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning. Sometimes he rides around to get in the right mindset before a new stunt. He knows he must stay calm before jumping. If he fully commits, he is fine."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. Her latest challenge was walking on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert in high-wire walking. Even though she had some circus skills, she found high-wire walking very different. ""The training was a shock,"" said Helen. ""I didn’t realize how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she said afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, using a kite, and biking."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick. He was stuck in a hostel bed for ten days without medicine because he had no money for hospital bills or to go home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night, because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about how to protect their habitat. The work is tough. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some areas and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but often it is wet. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a lab, where we will look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from my company. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for our chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues to keep them happy! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm in our food lab, and other times I'm traveling abroad to buy raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety and lack of routine in my job, although the chocolate itself is still my favorite part! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more chocolate in the evening!"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things such as balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air in front of an amazed audience. During the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how their children are doing. 

Sophia explains that for a circus career, performers need to avoid repeating the same acts – it's important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to succeed in the circus, you must keep practicing. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important – circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is crucial, but the best performers are those who want to succeed, have creativity, and always work on improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or only work a few months each year. But the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel with the circus while you're young, and then you need to think about other career options.

The course also teaches business planning. Many former students have started businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. However, Sophia warns that it's not a job for making a lot of money! ""The work usually means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive – but a lot of fun!"""
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you've probably heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the main singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers, but that's not true. They often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! 

""What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by what producers ask for. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job!""

""Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There's often no sheet music to look at. I'll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always know which musical range is best for the female voice. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it."""
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion. She created a successful company selling 'satchels,' which are traditional school bags. These bags are now sold in famous stores and are popular with celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie considered many business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. Not everyone agreed with her choice, but she was sure it would work. She worked with her mother, who had a natural talent for business, even though she had never had a career. The design of the satchels was inspired by children's storybooks. 

Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs at first, but they became important for her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To gain attention, she sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew. Her company now produces satchels much faster. Julie enjoys seeing which celebrity will be seen with a satchel next. Instead of spending money on online ads, she uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting.

There was a difficult time when another company copied her satchel design. Because of this, she now ensures she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. People who visit her offices notice the positive atmosphere, and employees enjoy working there. There is a new factory, but Julie believes it's the team that makes the place special."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with her schoolwork. 

As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The cycling track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ""I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all. When the excitement is gone, there's no point. Luckily, I found a new career.""

Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ""We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,"" she says. ""The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a larger group.""

The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ""Some people doubt if celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it to promote themselves, which might hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should."""
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher didn't listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her frustration. She posted it online, and it became very popular. She was thrilled when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, she was unsure because she didn't know the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. But Joss convinced her this wouldn't happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was an amazing night. Ana says she prefers writing songs about difficult times because she has more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes fans will like her songs, her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew our great-grandparents had lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to visit. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about what needed to be done. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people lived along that coast. On the first morning, the only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop worrying about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it really felt like stress-free living!

When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss my family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many games would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I did. It took some time for me to agree, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. My mom and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it turned out fine in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I didn’t have much time to spend with friends because of all the training, so that part didn’t change much for me. I eventually got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I learned that to get a license, I needed to know a lot more than I already did. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including its architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. 

Being a tour guide isn't just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of everyone in the group. You also need to be entertaining, tell interesting stories, and handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive or if a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour without hearing about any problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours because they might post reviews online. Good reviews are important because they attract more customers. That's why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. I put a lot of enthusiasm and energy into my job, which usually results in very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Even though she is five years younger than me, we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. However, in the end, there was nothing to worry about.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so collecting this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meal made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. We chose this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn’t include meat, which we both prefer to avoid. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day—I definitely will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people for their friends or homes; many different customers want flowers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often colder and darker than I'd like, but that's normal at that time, so I don't mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I'd probably only get pink ones because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what other people want can be different. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can't find what customers want.

I don't really like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it's part of the job. Flowers aren't cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we make flower arrangements and figure out the costs. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That's what you have to do when you're selling things, and I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the new films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It's close to where I live. But a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to talk about a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we pick a different place in the city each month. For example, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which helps us keep our prices low. We’re happy just to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make money. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still a lot to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say they had a great time, it’s wonderful. The website has been very helpful, and we’re now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We’ve visited to see how things are done in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog too, because we know most people now go online for film information, rather than reading reviews in local newspapers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. But nothing works as well as word of mouth – people telling their friends about us. And the audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month we had a movie quiz, which everyone enjoyed."
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite thing to do as a child. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby more seriously, so I decided to do something special. I started a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to upload these photos to a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and share my photos with others. I was surprised to find that people liked how I saw and photographed things. I also enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then someone suggested that my project would be better if all my photos had a common theme. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing, as they mostly took color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost gave up, but I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough for me to work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I’ve never regretted my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking, which I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and they are run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was quite shy then, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. 

I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me continue volunteering at the club because I had made great relationships with the children. Now, I am there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to going.

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before starting at the club, and the idea of youth work had never crossed my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I’ve earned several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was so young that I hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly grew to love the sport and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored of snowboarding, but I love competing and winning, which makes me push myself harder. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes it works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn't sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That success made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying because there is no snow. I train every day, but it's nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. It's the best way to cope with not being able to do what I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also think it's important to have another option in case I don't succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I'm considering becoming a doctor if I can find time for college. I can't imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can't do it my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I'm grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mom making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I was surprised at how easy it was, even though it looked complicated when I watched my mom. My friends thought it was boring, but I was excited about it. My mom showed me how to make beautiful things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewelry to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. I needed to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mom. There are always many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewelry to take home as gifts. Soon, we got calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but it was just my mom and me at a market stall! That's when I realized it could work, and it was time to create a website. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13 years old, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became very popular. The book is partly inspired by Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained that because her father’s job required the family to move often, she became good at making new friends. This experience helped her write about Amelia, the main character, who starts at a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since Janine is an only child, she had to use her imagination to write about that.

Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she had won first prize in a short story competition on a young writers’ website. Because of this, when she finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved the book, and a year later, it was available in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia notes that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters in the story face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer says that even though Janine is young and the book is not very long, she is a better writer than some other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being famous: ‘At first, I hid when people recognized me on the street, but now it’s OK. I’d like to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, spending time with my friends gives me ideas for writing!’"
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. This happened because my father got a job as the castle's manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open for visitors. He was happy about the job because he thought he might not get such a great opportunity again. However, it took some time for the rest of us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home across the water, and there was no school on the island. But after we moved, we quickly got used to living there. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment inside it is comfortable. In the summer, the island feels lively because many visitors come, and there are often parties on the beach. In the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers as I had hoped. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which can be hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days with big waves, but the ferries don't run then! I've learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is a problem. So when my school friends come to visit, I always tell them to hurry up! But we often see amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it's so foggy that you can't see anything, and then a few hours later, it's sunny again – it's still surprising when that happens, even after living here for a while. Of course, we do have terrible storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle is strong enough to avoid damage. But then I remember it's been here for hundreds of years – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I've always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and find the best spots to see them. It was amazing, and when we got back home, I joined a local young birdwatchers' club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I'm almost there. During family holidays abroad, I've had the chance to see birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I've been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I wasn't too disappointed when it didn't happen because I've learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it interesting and commented that it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I wasn't nervous until just before I was introduced and walked onto the stage. I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I'm lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn't have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and after some time, I became a pretty good player. However, my family knew that I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. In fact, I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. And the chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know that young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started training regularly with a big club when I was just 13 years old. After that, I improved a lot. Despite this, some people still doubted I would become a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me if we lost. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Even with the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, the team carried me around the field. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to believe they could play for a top team if they are willing to work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in higher education in the UK and around the world is encouraging students to start doing research early in their studies. This idea is based on the belief that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists making big discoveries. Instead, research is a natural and important way to learn and develop skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your job because they help you think about the world and how you work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You don't just learn and repeat information; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? Why does it matter? These questions are at the heart of what we call research.

Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is the complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained experts that leads to big changes and new knowledge. On the other end, research can be everyday inquiries with a solid plan, involving careful work and asking thoughtful questions about issues, practices, and events. Most students have been doing some form of research since school or work, asking questions that lead to investigations. You have been developing research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, choosing a music system, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, having a curious mind, identifying problems, critically exploring information, and creating your own responses and knowledge are expected. Some students might find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and learning means listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and authorities. However, in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process might seem daunting, but critical thinking is crucial in research. The research of others is valuable, but we need to do more than just repeat it. We should engage with it, think about it, test it, and see if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should not blindly accept information from others without questioning it."
80,"Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.

Scientists are now studying how living in a city affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. We have known for a long time that city life is tiring, but new research shows that it can also make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for our brains. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a quick look at nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from the busy city life.

This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are packed into crowded areas with many strangers. These unnatural surroundings can affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. When you walk down a busy street, your brain has to keep track of many things: distracted people, dangerous crossings, and the confusing city layout. This constant need to focus drains our mental energy because the brain has to decide what to pay attention to and what to ignore.

Natural environments, on the other hand, don't require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can refresh our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Even before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York offer people a break from urban life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people try many things to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or changing office layouts, simply walking in nature seems to be one of the best solutions.

Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Why do they remain centers of intellectual life, even in the digital age? Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that make us lose focus, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The ""concentration of social interactions"" is a big reason for urban creativity. Just as crowded 18th-century London led to new ideas, crowded 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a hub for technology and creativity. Less crowded cities might produce less innovation over time.

The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. After all, there are times when people say, ""I'm tired of nature, take me to the city!"""
81,"Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious to say that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain-scanning technology to support this idea. However, I believe we shouldn't limit the study of the mind to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects and tools also play a role in how we think. Archaeology shows that things like stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and shaping our minds. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might still be part of the mind.

It's easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their usual surroundings. This approach makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limitations of brain-scanning machines. But it often overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny that the brain is crucial for thinking, but I believe the mind is more than just the brain. We should explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world.

This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking process, like when we use clay to make numbers or a stone to make a tool. It also studies how these interactions have changed over time and what they mean for our thinking. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they work by changing our understanding of what objects do for the mind.

Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does this person's sense of self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick shows how minds and objects can be continuous. It also illustrates the flexibility of the human mind: the stick helps the blind person turn touch into sight, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. This example reminds us that human intelligence is adaptable and can change by incorporating new technologies.

I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, from early stone tools to the internet, tools have served as pathways for humans to explore and understand the world, not as barriers. Unlike a monkey using a stick to get food, humans use tools to satisfy our curiosity. This unique human trait explains why we create things and how these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world.

I want to include material objects in our understanding of the mind. MET offers a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from ancient tools to modern smartphones, have helped define and transform who we are and how we think. While ""mind-changing technology"" might sound futuristic, humans have been using it since we first evolved."
82,"Photography is one of the few inventions that have greatly changed how we see the world and our culture. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became a part of everyday life. It influenced many areas, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians believe that photography might be the most significant contribution of the US to the visual arts. No other art form has been as dominated by US work. This shows how photography has become central to US culture and thought. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, it was a mechanical process, which fit well with the growing interest in technology in the US. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world feel smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with amazing speed. Second, the camera was the best tool for showing one's self-image in a country where personal and national identities were always changing. Third, the camera was important for creating and keeping family memories, even if they were a bit idealized. Lastly, the realistic nature of photographs matched the US artists' focus on realism and everyday life. 

A photograph draws attention to what the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""This, you should see!"" Because a photograph is made by a machine, it is a record of what was in front of the camera, giving it a sense of objectivity. However, since it is taken by a person, it also has a personal point of view. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, which is why photography is often called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph is more complex. No image is shown to us without some context that affects how we understand it, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and how it was first seen. The same image can be seen in different places and times, and its meaning can change each time.

For a long time, the camera's role in art was not widely acknowledged, but now it is very important for contemporary artists. Since the time of US artist Andy Warhol, who used photographs in his paintings and other works, artists have been using photographs in many ways. In short, photography has become an essential part of art, working alongside painting and changing how we think about representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, which includes our thoughts and feelings, and we try to understand it. Although we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it is still a complex idea. James focused on human psychology, which he believed included thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences, which may not always align with scientific facts. 

We often act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on psychological topics, like whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. Problems occur when people have different views. Formal psychology aims to find the most accurate explanations for these situations. Psychologists help us separate personal opinions from scientific facts. 

Psychology studies the mind and brain, but we don't fully understand the brain's role in our emotions and behaviors. Since it's hard to study the brain directly, psychologists learn more by observing behavior and forming ideas about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind's workings are not directly visible. We can only infer them from behavior, similar to solving a crossword puzzle by interpreting clues. 

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and influence mental processes. Achieving these goals helps us apply psychological findings to real life, such as improving teaching methods, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings. Although people have discussed psychological questions for centuries, scientific study began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to study the mind, but this method has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, introspection only shows a small part of brain activity. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows the less successful side of consumer capitalism, where products that didn't sell well are displayed. You can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola there. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story about the people who designed and marketed it. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business. You might think companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but many executives visit the museum because they don't. They often avoid thinking about their failures and don't keep samples of unsuccessful products. 

The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failures. Since the 1960s, he collected samples of every new product he could find. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection naturally became full of unsuccessful ones. This reflects today's culture of optimism, where people often don't realize a product will fail. Even if they do, marketers might spend more money on a failing product to try to make some sales and save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and people involved often avoid discussing it.

This focus on optimism is common in the growing self-help industry. A popular method is ""positive visualization,"" where imagining success is believed to make it more likely. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that people tend to be overly optimistic about their chances of success, which might be linked to evolution. Her research shows that well-balanced people often have an unrealistic, positive view of their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen studied whether positive thinking about the future is effective. Her research found that imagining success can actually reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people who were encouraged to think they would have a successful week at work ended up achieving less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that how we view failure depends on our beliefs about ability. People with a ""fixed theory"" mindset think ability is natural and unchangeable, so they see failure as proof they aren't good enough. For example, a sports star who believes he is a ""natural"" might not practice enough to improve. On the other hand, people with an ""incremental theory"" believe ability can grow with effort and challenges. They see failure as a sign they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger by being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."
85,"Sports teams often perform better when they play at home, but why is this? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors are challenging the idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists are exploring what helps players perform at their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, financial experts wonder if home advantage should matter if players are paid well enough to feel comfortable anywhere.

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their support is crucial for the team's success. Fans often think that their cheering leads to goals, but they forget the times when their support didn't result in a goal.

However, one fan belief is supported by science: home fans influence referees. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This suggests referees avoid making decisions that would anger the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar. Despite these changes, home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the strongest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball focuses more on individual matchups, while basketball relies on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home.

Another factor could be players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This might be linked to a natural instinct to defend home territory. In recent rugby matches, underdog teams won at home by showing determination and aggression, demonstrating home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, ""The more I practise, the luckier I get."" This saying is popular among athletes and coaches because it suggests that practice leads to improvement. However, Player didn't mean ""lucky"" in the usual sense; he meant that practice makes you better. This idea is part of the ongoing debate about whether talent is something you're born with or something you develop through practice.

The debate isn't balanced; it leans heavily towards the idea that practice is more important than natural talent. This belief is largely based on psychologist Anders Ericsson's theory that becoming an expert in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has inspired books like Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers,"" which argue that practice is the key to success.

However, in his book, Epstein challenges this idea. He points out that studies often focus only on successful people, which can be misleading. Epstein explores why some people excel while others don't, considering factors like genetics, environment, support, and determination. His research takes him around the world, even to Alaska, where he learns that the drive of sled dogs in races might be partly genetic. This suggests that determination might not be entirely a choice but could have a genetic component.

Epstein distinguishes between ""hardware"" (nature) and ""software"" (nurture) and believes both are important for elite athletes. He acknowledges the role of training and environment but also highlights cases where genetics play a crucial role. He raises questions about race and gender in sports, asking why men and women compete separately if practice is the only factor that matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most revealing."
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are children today so unhappy? In her book, ""Kith,"" Griffiths suggests that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers, and have lost touch with nature. She believes this is the main problem. This idea matches other discussions about modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many people over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they spent long summer days exploring, swimming, or building dens. They believe this was healthier than the protected lives children have now. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have created these protective rules for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book includes strong arguments. She talks about how the fear of danger keeps children indoors, which benefits the toy and gadget industry that sells entertainment for kids at home. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. It's unclear how common these rules are, but Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly. She also discusses childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules. While her arguments are appealing, Griffiths sometimes takes them too far and ignores important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems exaggerated.

Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children. She mostly sees them in an idealized way, which might not hold up in real life with energetic kids. She suggests that children are naturally creative thinkers, but this might not be true for all. The main idea of her book is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children learn to manage risk by experiencing small accidents. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children may want the adventurous life Griffiths describes. Some children are naturally shy or cautious. Perhaps the real mistake is forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them to explore."
88,"I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I've spent a lot of time in school. I'm good at solving problems in my work and life, but this isn't because of my schooling. Most life problems can't be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play. Those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, moral lives can't be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is crucial for economic success. We don't need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate problems, we'll have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We can't teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling focused on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring for them, and cooperating. Children naturally want to play with others, and this play helps them learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit anytime. If you can't quit, it's not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue the game. This makes play very democratic. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there's more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They result from social factors like parents' fears, warnings from experts, less cohesive neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children don't need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They need to follow their natural drives to play and explore to become strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to directly contact potential employers, which used to be possible only by standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with this access, there is also a higher chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the jobseeker hoped they could help him get a job. But the executive was not pleased. She was upset that a stranger expected her to share her valuable contacts and sent a harsh rejection note, which went viral online. People who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone, even if she stands by her message. This incident might make young people think more carefully about using social media professionally. It highlights that social media can be risky for job seekers who don't know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes.

There is an irony here because, in many countries, social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of people in their twenties for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was like an online playground where we could impress others and try new things. It was often based on fantasy. You could chat with someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. By choosing the right pictures or songs for your Facebook page, you could become a different, more interesting person overnight. And if you didn't want to talk, you could just ""poke"" people on Facebook.

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. Our experience with sites like Facebook might actually be a problem. For some people in their twenties, the line between personal and professional use is not clear. We first became popular online by being bold and confident, which might explain why some of us still think this is a good idea. Just because many people ""liked"" your posts on Facebook doesn't mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers that you're worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn't apply anymore. We must meet employers' standards if we want to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too informal and seem arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of our generation as ""entitled."" In reality, many of us are desperate to find jobs, which is why we turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt young people's chances of getting hired, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending generic, impersonal messages, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it requires careful handling to avoid closing doors."
90,"Anyone who claims they can predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre reports that only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people predict that printed newspapers will disappear in about 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist said books and theatre were outdated and newspapers would become the main source of social life. Yet, theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived alongside TV, and cinema has competed with videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008.

Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph, which made it possible to produce news for a large audience. Also important was the idea that everything is constantly changing and we need regular updates, a concept unfamiliar in medieval times. Now, we expect change. In medieval times, people only knew the passing of seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Life was seen as cyclical, with recurring truths.

Journalism as a full-time job only became common in the 19th century. Even then, there was no clear reason why people needed regular news. Regular newspaper publication can be limiting. Online news allows readers to check updates based on their interests. Search engines and algorithms help personalize news. Online news can provide minute-by-minute updates and correct errors quickly. There are no space limits, and full documents can be accessed. This is very different from traditional newspapers.

However, few online news providers focus on spreading understanding. They often rush to be first with the news, encourage reader comments, and create noise and confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we are returning to that. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction, or they might find a way to help us understand our chaotic world."
91,"If humans were truly comfortable under the moon and stars, we would enjoy walking in the dark, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many night-active animals do. However, we are creatures of the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a fundamental part of our genetics, even if we don't often think of ourselves as day creatures, just like we don't always think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This explains why we have changed the night by filling it with light. We have engineered the night to suit us, similar to how we control rivers with dams. This control has benefits but also causes problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just beginning to study. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, where artificial light shines into the sky instead of focusing downward. This bad lighting brightens the night, changing the natural light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would have been meaningless. Imagine approaching London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's largest city. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and public gaslights wouldn't appear for another seven years. From a distance, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We've illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that's not true. Many mammals are active at night. Light is a strong biological force and attracts many species. This attraction is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds are 'captured' by searchlights or gas flares, flying around them until they fall. Birds migrating at night often crash into brightly lit tall buildings, with young birds on their first journey being most affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd times when exposed to artificial light. People once thought light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need a perfect view of the night sky, but we do need darkness. Ignoring the need for darkness is pointless. Darkness is as important for our health as light. Changing our natural sleep-wake cycle can cause health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological reflection of Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so essential that disrupting them is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs near a bright highway. Living in our own bright lights, we have disconnected from our evolutionary and cultural roots—the stars and the natural day-night cycle. Light pollution makes us lose our sense of place in the universe and forget our true scale, which is best understood under a deep night sky with the Milky Way above."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently said that his company will stop tracking how much paid holiday time employees take. This idea was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. The email seemed like it was written by someone from his media team. 

Ignoring the way the announcement was made, which seemed like an attempt to make the policy look friendly, we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn’t harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company. In smaller companies, employees know each other’s work better and can judge if their absence would be a problem. 

The founder of the multinational said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team projects are up to date and their absence won’t harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much you prepare before a holiday, there is always a lot of work waiting when you return. This is just how taking leave works; work piles up while you are away. 

Following these rules might make employees not take leave at all, or feel guilty if they do. Feeling guilty can lead to stress, and if workers don’t take enough leave, productivity might drop over time. There could also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who takes time off and for how long. This pressure already affects decisions like when to start and end the workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotions. 

If the security of having a set amount of leave is removed, people might feel they can’t take the leave they need because they don’t want to seem lazy. They wouldn’t have their legal right to leave to rely on. This policy might make workers feel stuck, unable to take their leave, or they might just stick to their legal rights, making the policy pointless. 

Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, anywhere, which has blurred the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company couldn’t track work hours accurately, why should it use an old standard for time off? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being watched, making them monitor themselves, which could be harmful. 

Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits like better morale, creativity, and productivity that are expected from the unlimited leave policy can happen without affecting worker well-being. I am doubtful that letting employees ""take as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is a process where experts in a field review a scientific paper before it is published. This is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research, preventing flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often reassure the public about this process. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trustworthy research? The answer is both yes and no. Examining these issues shows that scientific publishing is changing. 

I am not ready to give up on journal-based peer review yet. I believe papers should still be checked before being formally published. However, I notice changes happening. One important change is the increasing use of preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers posted online without peer review. They allow new research results to be shared quickly so others can read, critique, and build on them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers. This has affected both authors and reviewers. Scientists compete for spots in top journals, which can lead to excellent work but also encourages cutting corners. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is suitable for a journal based on its newsworthiness, not just its scientific quality. These issues are known, but few are willing to change the current system. 

Biologist Ron Vale suggests that preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a big change from the norm. Although preprints have been around for twenty years, they are not widely used. This is partly because scientists are conservative and because there is a misconception that journals won't accept papers that have been posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review could lead to 'junk science,' but this hasn't happened yet. 

Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but authors know they will be critiqued by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper critiqued another published paper, which is difficult to do in traditional journals. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and all discussions were open for readers to see. This transparency allows readers to judge the quality of the arguments. Even if a journal rejects the paper, the preprint and comments remain available, so the work is not wasted. 

Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They can also be a place to share negative results, which are often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing their effectiveness in spreading information. By using the internet's openness and the collaborative spirit of the scientific community, preprints can help focus attention on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" These answers usually don't satisfy either of us. One day, I asked a group to pick an object and write two paragraphs about it: one describing it like a scientist would, and another from the object's perspective, titled ""Poem."" One student wrote:

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I'm a device that helps people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and even then, only for a short time. Most people will never need me.

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and sparked interesting discussions. When I was in school, poetry often seemed confusing to me. I thought of each poem as a difficult puzzle that blocked true understanding and emotion. After school, many people find poetry less appealing. Sometimes you come across a poem, and it stands out because it's not like regular prose. It almost challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down by its simplicity or because it’s hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we expect from poems? Aren't they supposed to hold deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem to be yes. But if we want to cry, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to different worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. Yet, a poem can offer something unique: ambiguity. Everyday life is full of it, unlike straightforward reading. But these ideas still don't explain what a poem really is.

If you search online for ""poem,"" it leads you to ""poetry,"" described as ""a form of literary art using the beauty and rhythm of language."" This is academic language, but it hides the word's origins. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek ""poí?ma,"" meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things."" So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – carefully crafted and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don't hold up under scrutiny. The value in comparing a poem to something else is not in the comparison itself but in the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps the mind explore new ways of thinking and see ordinary things differently.

Thinking of a poem as a mental object is not hard, especially when we consider how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren't words sometimes like sticks and stones? Imagine a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, looking right at you: A poem can make a strong impact like nothing else, even though, as ink on paper, it does no more than the prose around it. What about all the empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it never really becomes a product to sell. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry books, but few expect them to make back their printing costs. A poem presents itself not as something for the market, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special place in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been wiser to spend it on something useful for the house. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has made me happy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. But since it was raining, I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, intricately designed loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the passenger seat as I drove home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. ‘Marion!’ I called, ‘I've got something for you.’ She came into the room and stopped when she saw it. ‘What is it?’ she asked. I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I was anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says you must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask me, ‘Now that you've found something so amazing, are you going to stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing—he keeps going, hoping for an even bigger catch tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. I wonder what they would think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during sudden Caribbean rain and lazy mornings in comfortable Italian beds. Better sleep is a nice benefit of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. Even with noisy birds nearby, I could sleep deeply and dream more than I thought possible. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I don't think just relaxing explains why travel sleep feels so different. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. While sleeping, we process all these new experiences. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with each place. People often worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. In Trinidad, for example, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep patterns. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all felt sleepy and lay down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows around. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is also memorable. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my dreams. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said diplomatically to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking a bit like a bulldog. ""But it's so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said firmly, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change the woman's mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, whom they knew nothing about. Her husband Jeff had been quick to comment when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff said when Mia told him, ""What kind of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" ""Sounds pretentious,"" Jeff retorted. He didn't like anything showy or fake. He also didn't believe in being too polite, which he called Mia's reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn't have hesitated to tell the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said a trash can lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you're too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and entered the back door of Medlar House. Her commute from work was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia had the idea to convert the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends who struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions that there was definitely a demand. She was right. From the start, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham, where they could try on as many hats as they needed to find the right one. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits so nothing was left to chance. She recently expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It's a long journey from London to Atlanta, and Lawrence Okoye is reflecting on his incredible sports career. He is confident, but even he is surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Despite never playing American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen by a top team in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still learning the details of his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be selected for one of the biggest teams in American sports seems unbelievable. But Lawrence is used to proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on discus instead, after playing rugby. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training to prepare for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in an NFL contract, he says, ""American football was always in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then."" Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played the game, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ""Pretty much,"" he says. ""I went online and applied."" Was he nervous about competing with experienced American football players? ""No,"" he says. ""I don't get nervous about many things."" He doesn't talk much, but he is confident in his abilities. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ""I was very pleased to hear that,"" he says, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is also cautious. Lawrence has no basic experience in American football. How can someone so new make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have all the qualities needed. It's just about how hard I work,"" he replies. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he has been selected? ""I am. There's no pressure on me. Many people say I'll definitely be selected, but I'm not too worried."" This calm attitude might come from his disappointing Olympic discus final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved past this and is happy he made it to the final with an impressive last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he says. ""The final didn't go as I wanted, but that's part of sports. I can always return to it."" After his Olympic setback, some thought the experience had affected him. Lawrence doesn't comment on this. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his great physical abilities, wouldn't it be better to focus on just one sport? ""I understand why someone would say that,"" he responds. ""I'm trying to achieve something I've dreamed about since I was a schoolkid. If it doesn't work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I've made has been carefully thought out."""
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, even though it was mid-September, it hadn't started snowing in Siberia yet. There were no signs of human life, just an endless view of mountains, streams, and forests. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow traveling to remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I told him I believed there was a road, though not many people used it anymore. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend named Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and said ""Holodna"" (cold) while pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at discounted prices. I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats, some taking notes without much energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was fulfilling. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and there were long holidays for adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: cycling around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was his biggest yet. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong those who doubted him. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to participate. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed I was healthy, and the second ensured I emptied my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned I needed to stay oriented. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" I was told, and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. As we moved down the runway, my legs were up, trying not to touch the steering pedals, and my hands were avoiding the switches. I decided not to relax and enjoy the flight, despite the instructions. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right times. Panicking is not helpful. This wasn't comforting as we started accelerating. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we quickly turned right. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the plane's roof. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for a small gap between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was interrupted by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even done any acrobatics yet.

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too—it was that responsive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what pilots experience during races. To show this, Dario ate sandwiches happily after we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed of doing loops repeatedly."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you've ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. He says his ideal temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned how to survive in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. 'I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.' He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. 'I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. There were people who specialized in coral, elephants, chimpanzees. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.' The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. 'It is certainly easier to film today. If you filmed something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can film a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You filmed less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.' 'My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.' Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy task. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very difficult. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. 'We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. This meant he had to swim in very cold water and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for an even more challenging expedition. Explorers are confident and determined people, and they need to be. This time, there is a lot more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometer journey to the North Pole, where they will take detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tougher by sending him out into the Scottish mountains during blizzards with very few clothes. His father also loved adventures in cold places, and Pen showed he had great physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors and helps run his polar guide business. She says she worries more about him when he is at home because he is often thinking about the Arctic. For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horseback compete against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he admits. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I thought it would be a good idea to say to my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He absolutely took it to heart, asking his mum how she was all the time, but the strain eventually became too much. While it was well intentioned, it was an unfair thing to do.’ For similar reasons he is planning to have very little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending these last days before departure preparing his kit, obsessively. ‘Out on the ice, one is virtually incapable of mending things or doing anything that isn’t absolutely straightforward,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, one of the world’s leading polar explorers, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will be supported by a crew of six, flying in supplies. Being part of a team is actually more stressful to someone with his mentality, says Pen, and something else is on his mind too. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done far less training than I’m comfortable with.’ Why? ‘Organisational things always seem more urgent. So I’m almost fearful of what I’m going to ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations into the unknown. ‘Making it to the North Pole was ultimately a personal ambition,’ he admits, ‘and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will profit from the data, and we’re creating a platform in which to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and nobody can do it but us,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which are otherwise bizarre and socially redundant, have become hyper-relevant. Suddenly, we’re socially useful again.’"
103,"I took a year off and wondered what to do next. Being an Olympic athlete is amazing, and during my break, I had opportunities to write, work on TV, and speak at schools and businesses. Although these activities were interesting, I missed having a competitive challenge. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to compete in the Olympics again, so I started running marathons and doing triathlons. But there was still an invitation from TV presenter Ben Fogle in my mind: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed the feeling of the boat moving through the water, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. I knew if I joined the race, I would want to win. I wasn't sure if Ben was the best partner for winning, but the idea of being an underdog was appealing. 

Ben was already planning to do the race and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the costs, which were high—just the boat and equipment would cost £70,000. We thought we had a good chance, but it would still require effort to secure everything. Besides the race expenses, I also had to consider the loss of income from being away. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete, and it's nice that people are interested. However, I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Joining the race would give me something new to talk about: rowing across the Atlantic.

Planning this adventure taught me to appreciate the simpler life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but straightforward, with set training programs and support from doctors and dieticians. I was worried about how people would react to me racing with a TV presenter, thinking it might seem like I just wanted to be on TV. But during our preparations, my concerns faded. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about mental strength than just rowing skills. Ben had done tough challenges before, like the Marathon des Sables and spending time on a deserted island, but he wasn't experienced in rowing. I was surprised by his lack of natural rowing ability, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have expected his level of skill when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I quit my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty spaces, maybe because of the noise and crowded life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they have many tourists who want sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to over 100. Recently, they took over a second place called the 'wilderness farm,' which they said was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away.

November 6, London On my flight, I stare at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies; I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out the window instead. People say that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of blooming flowers and leaves. But I think I see the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests with thin conifers covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely inside when I’m given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes very loud by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, pulling out huskies and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost crazy with excitement, pulling hard on the ropes to start running. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much anyway. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I face tough questions about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m unsure. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving license?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very hard in freezing conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is full of instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around by overexcited huskies. But I feel triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the media gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would allow her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about using emu oil, a natural treatment recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman. Radcliffe used it to heal after a training accident where she ran into a bike. Radcliffe says she never fully realized the importance of her achievement. Looking back, she knows it was a big deal, but at the time, it felt like just another race. Her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried she might not keep up the fast pace and could drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, but he understood why someone might think it was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast but still managed to sprint the last bit in 2 minutes and 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ""I can run faster than that."" The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't expect anyone to beat that time soon, but Radcliffe thought she could do it again next year. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. After the race, people wondered how she, with her awkward running style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her for weeks, helping her recover from running 250-300 kilometers each week. He said, ""I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle pain like her. She would push me to work so hard on her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward."" Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to her training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ""Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting."" There was no friendly greeting, just straight to work. Radcliffe would push him to give everything he had, which made her so good. During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes became jealous. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has beaten her record? ""Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people race each other more than themselves."" What does she mean? ""I never relaxed, even when I was winning. I always pushed myself as hard as I could."" Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She never ran that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"When my first cooking show, ""In Search of Perfection,"" was released, I was unsure how viewers and the press would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our show added something new to this movement, but I still worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques, but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often very physical, involving travel with passports and suitcases. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who dedicates his life to making the best golden pasta. These people have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was left out. I could imagine people asking, ""Where's steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?"" However, after long discussions, the TV team and I created a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book's title, I knew from the start that I wasn't claiming the recipes were 'definitive.' But I thought that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying ideas and refining them until you create something unique. The TV series allowed me to explore foods, people, and places I had never seen before, and I was excited about that, as well as exploring memory and nostalgia in food, because that's how I started in this business. Finding the best ingredients for the recipes took me around the world. Some of my adventures included being taken to a canning factory that processed the wrong type of tomato and visiting a dairy farm with such low standards that we had to stop filming. Perfecting each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine, and nearly burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still a few hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and suddenly went off the road into a field, stopping completely. John got out and opened the hood to look at the engine. He stood there for a long time, looking like he knew what he was doing. Finally, he admitted, ""Actually, I have no idea what I'm doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried and said, ""We can't stay here forever."" The field was huge, with just grass and lots of flowers like poppies and daisies. I agreed with Bea because it was always safest to be on her side. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass and asked me to tell a story. Bea lay down next to her and said, ""Go on, tell us a story."" So, I told them about how I heard two birds talking the day before we left London. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and a fight over a worm. Bea said, ""That's silly, no one understands bird language."" My eyes stung, and I said, ""I do,"" but I didn't sound convincing. ""Liar,"" Bea said, and I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ""Mum...?"" But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a hotel. Bea didn't want to get out, but the boys didn't mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back door windows. We followed John into a café near where our van was parked. ""It's a hotel,"" John whispered. ""I think it might be expensive."" ""We'll just have some tea,"" Mum said, and we sat in the shade on the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot and said, ""It's like syrup in there."" We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the engine. ""It's a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum made a bed for us outside in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn't moving. ""I'll have to get us towed into Marrakech,"" John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John driving it. At first, Bea didn't want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. She sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we would get home since our van needed to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike Lucy, they were not competing. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, but Lucy didn't catch her name because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing, their recent travels, and their future plans. 

Lucy mentioned she might go to the Tanglewood festival that summer, which sounded impressive. However, she didn't really want to go. She often felt this way about the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. Lucy hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad celebrated by buying her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant, and her little brother Gus dreamed of attending the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. 

The truth was, Lucy hadn't applied to the festival herself. Her mother had filled out the application and sent in a CD. Her mom said she didn't want Lucy to be disappointed if she didn't get in. Lucy thought it was more about not giving her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn't even think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo seemed surprised when Lucy mentioned Tanglewood. He asked her age, and when she said fifteen, he exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't mean to show off. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was just fitting in or bragging. She explained it was part of a new youth program they were trying. Liesel/Louisa excused herself to talk to someone else, but the guy from Tokyo stayed. He asked if Lucy had ever been to Japan. She said she had, once, when she was about eight. Before he could reply, Lucy's grandfather came over and took her away to introduce her to someone else. He reminded her not to get too friendly with the competition, but Lucy said they weren't competing. Her grandfather insisted that everyone was competition.

He took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, only half-listening. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather told her she did well and that he was proud of her. He said the festival was important and that people were talking about her. Lucy liked being recognized, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn't earn her any special respect from her school friends. Even her best friend, Reyna, wouldn't care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro perfectly. But in places like the festival, she knew she was important."
109,"Dad said, ""Spending too much time online isn't good for you. You need to experience the real world."" It's hard to argue with him, so I looked into what experts say about this topic, and it's quite interesting. Research generally shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a key part of modern childhood. Teenagers don't just use media for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do; they live in it. It's not about whether it's good or bad, but how you use it.

How does our social networking compare to what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it's like the modern version of hanging out at a youth club, which today's parents did when they were younger. It helps teenagers develop their identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and interact with peers.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says adolescence is a time to ask, ""Who am I?"" Social networking can help you develop your self-identity by letting you share your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see that others have different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are less self-centered than those who don't use social media. He also says that social media can be helpful if you're shy because communicating online can be more comfortable than face-to-face, allowing you to practice social skills in a less intimidating environment.

Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with specific interests connect with others who share those interests. For example, if only a few people at your school like a certain type of music, you might feel isolated. But finding a group online with similar interests can make you feel more connected and popular in a different way.

Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online, join networks of like-minded people, and create their own content are really using the potential of social networks. She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force, with teenagers making videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are changing creativity by allowing photographers to connect, learn, and share images, which can improve their skills and interest. This can also help with employability, as businesses use social media to sell and increase brand awareness. Understanding how social media works can help you create customers. For example, if you have 1000 friends on different social networks, they could be potential customers for a product you develop.

Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they enter the workforce, agrees Matthews. Many sites offer opportunities to collaborate with others to create and share content. Collaboration is a key 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age."
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they probably don't imagine a long road trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. However, my parents had a different idea for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan what many teenagers would consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. Before the trip, my parents kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There's probably a good reason for that!""

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. I had some ideas on how to cope. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home for smaller accommodations over the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest, star-filled skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way! The next day, we were up early and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what was to come later in our trip. As we climbed to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. We laughed when we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common, and our own close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger gave us unforgettable memories.

As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its creaky floors and no internet or cell phone service, couldn't dampen our spirits. In exchange, I got to see the most amazing views. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic foreign place to find something amazing. It was bittersweet to be home again, but at least I hadn't argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our crazy journey to look through and remember. For me, the best memories were the unplanned and spontaneous moments."
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay because it was her final year, and she was happy to have the best room at the college, which had its own kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still keep an eye on Amy, even if she didn't like it.

Rose was moving to her grandmother's house. She only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose's parents were not very excited about it, but Daisy insisted it was no problem and was happy to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn't fully understand why her parents didn't get along with her grandmother, but there had been a disagreement in the past, which meant they spent holidays elsewhere. Rose was ten years old the last time she saw her grandmother, but her memories were happy ones.

Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and good at bringing people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady and seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England. Before moving, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, staying fit, and getting enough sleep. But Rose wanted her independence. She wanted to play loud music, invite friends over, or go out without asking for permission every time. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and she didn't want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood.

Rose's mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, Dahlia insisted. Rose was thrilled. They all agreed it would be about trust. Her grandmother would trust her to act maturely and make grown-up decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If either of them went too far, they would talk about it again. Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and basically start her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced at it now. At least she knew this was the last time, as she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book was a big achievement because it seemed difficult, and she wasn't sure what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. She recently told her former teacher, who was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't understand why she should wait to do something she might be good at.

On a winter afternoon at her publisher's office, I was surprised to see a teenager, even though I knew I was interviewing a 15-year-old about her book. The book is impressive: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support, but she doesn't need any help. She is confident, intelligent, and steady, which keeps her from being overconfident.

Charlotte admits she is young and doesn't have all the answers. When I ask her about the complex moral issues in her book, she says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don't have many life lessons to share,"" she laughs. ""I don't think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I'm not particularly wise either. I just wanted to explore the theme of taking responsibility.""

She has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in books. She believes there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who lacks social skills. Reading about these types annoyed her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who aren't flawed in some way. Some writers unintentionally suggest that teenagers can't know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.""

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep psychological and life themes. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I was capable of it."" However, she praises a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It says if the reader can guess what happens next, the suspense is gone.""

Some might think Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get published. Her father's connection in publishing did help her book get read initially. She admits she's lucky because getting a first novel read is hard, no matter the author's age. ""Every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show he knew what he was doing, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump quickly. As he flew into the air, his arms were flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He landed, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it. If I tried to join the skateboarders, I’d probably be laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students would jump, try new tricks, and land in foam pits – not a real introduction to what we’d face on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope gets steep again. Land in the right zone, and you keep moving forward, reducing impact. Land on the flat, and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why speed is important. At first, it was hard to make my body ignore my brain and go fast towards the jump. My legs would almost go backward as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body is doing in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, and then I was in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment I felt like I was walking on air, proud of reaching such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I didn’t slow down as I approached the jump, flew into the air, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and your nails dig into the safety harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There's a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. With your teeth clenched, you speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park.

It's surprising that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are such a big industry. To give visitors the excitement and escape they want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's a real challenge. They must create the right mix of fun and fear while keeping everyone safe, and also come up with new ideas to keep people interested.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most of the techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the tracks made by specialist manufacturers.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it's about quickly changing between different forces so people feel excited but safe. It's a fine line between thrilling and uncomfortable.

To create an amazing ride, rollercoaster teams must build a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or the steepest drop. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that designers need to love thrills to understand what passengers want and to test rides before opening them to the public.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add something extra, like painting an old rollercoaster, but the physical ride experience will remain the most important for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating pieces for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances occasionally. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. She explains, ""Dancing again reminds me of what it's like to be in the studio, taking orders from demanding choreographers, which can be tense and frustrating. Choreographers can forget what it's like to rehearse all day."" As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching and working with young students. ""New dancers are often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want success but don't fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This means they accept even harsh criticism. They might challenge me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her work. ""There might be music I don't like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don't respond well to a certain composer's music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can't just choose a new piece. Ideally, I'd like to be more experimental and switch to different music, which would help when rehearsals get tough. But now, I work on big productions where the music is already decided by the composer and can't be changed.""

Miranda doesn't want to be tied to one institution. ""It's important to meet new people. But I have to remember that each theatre and school I work with has different methods and styles. So, I need to adapt my work each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.""

We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ""There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,"" says Miranda. ""This one tries to show what life is really like in a dance company. There was a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I recognized that. She knows she's not doing it right but can't make her body do it. It's hard to watch but not fake. The public underestimates the work and dedication needed in ballet.""

I'm curious about what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ""It's when everything – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection might be too much to ask, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I've been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props is distracting, and that's disappointing.""

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ""People want to label you, and I don't understand that. There's a trend to focus on a narrow area of expertise, but I don't follow that. Maybe one day I'll be known for one thing, but for now, I want to broaden my horizons."""
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there’s so much to experience outside? That conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the main feature of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to secure myself. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even spending one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to continue. I’ve been on many walking trips recently, but this was completely different. It was the longest distance I’ve ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino, instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, and I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I’d rather talk about dragging a sofa 100 miles across southern England than discuss the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea for me. At the Greek port, the man seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I explained that I wouldn't be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although he still looked puzzled, he let me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we left, but there was little time to talk before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was happy when I finally did it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and enjoyment of completing them. There seemed to be little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year."
118,"Being a flight attendant isn't easy, but it's a great job for someone young like me. Since I started, I've traveled all over, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have lots of free time, and life is never dull. As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, so I often flew alone. I felt lonely and would ask flight attendants if I could help them serve meals, and some let me. This memory stayed with me when I wanted to leave my banking job and find a new path. At the interview, there were many young people, and lots of them got accepted. They were often well-qualified and changing careers, like me. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. Instead of just saying I loved to travel, I talked about my strengths and past work experience, and I got the job! I recommend this job to anyone because there are many reasons it's worth it, but free flights aren't the main one. Most airline staff work very hard, and there's a saying: ""no-one's finished till everyone's finished."" It's like a big family. Even though we don't see each other all the time, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to take work home. And if I do have difficult passengers, which doesn't happen often, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won't see them again!"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love watching the children succeed at things they didn't think they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel very nervous, but with some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top eventually. This makes them feel really good. 

At the start of the week, some children miss home. Surprisingly, it's not the youngest ones who feel this way the most, but the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's a bit late now and they should do it tomorrow. Most children feel better in a couple of days, and by the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time.

It's not just the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call us a lot, asking how their child is doing, which isn't really necessary. Often, their child is busy playing games or doing other activities, so we have to ask the parents to call back later. We also often see a certain type of child who comes dressed in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why it's necessary."
120,"'Rock the Planet' is a musical show where the actors also need to be great musicians. It started in London last year after being in the USA for five years, where it won 'Best Musical' four times! Doing the show with only British actors was difficult because the UK has stricter rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they have just won their first 'Best Musical' award. The London theatre is bigger than the one in the USA, and it has been full every night because everyone wants to hear the songs that became famous in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, 'It's amazing that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.' He explained how busy the young actors are. 'We have regular school lessons at the theatre every day. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.' I asked what his friends think of the show. 'My whole class came to see it! The theatre offers special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it's expensive for them,' he said. When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie found an extra one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called 'Days,' which I didn't know. Jamie helped me learn it, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie's talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show's director wasn't there to hear my mistakes! Although the young actors were already musicians and some played several instruments, none had been in a band before. Luckily, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it's definitely worth seeing."
