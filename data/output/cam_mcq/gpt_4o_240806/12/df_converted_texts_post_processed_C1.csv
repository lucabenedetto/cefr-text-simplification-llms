1,C2,"Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of public check-ins—announcing your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing awareness of the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost. It might seem depressing, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame, all before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. At that time, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was invented at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and readers were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While it was the work of an exhibitionist, there was also a beauty to his project that some might call art. One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people want to be with you, you'll be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our digital lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film combined documentary and drama to show that there is much about our universe that we don't understand. While scientists agree that we don't have all the answers about the universe, some were concerned enough to publicly criticize the film, calling it everything from ""atrocious"" to ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film intriguing to many. 
Initially, the film seemed harmless, with scientists discussing how new discoveries reveal the universe to be stranger than expected. However, the controversy arose when the film claimed that water molecules could be affected by thoughts. It mentioned a Japanese researcher who supposedly showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. The film supported this claim with pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being exposed to positive thoughts and looking unpleasant after negative ones. While some people found this evidence convincing, many scientists were skeptical, saying, ""Give me a break."" They argued that such claims need solid proof, and pretty pictures of crystals are not enough.
The real issue is that the film's claims weren't strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere, linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This idea is supported by decades of research. Recent discoveries show that the universe is indeed stranger than we thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" On a more relatable level, neuroscientists have discovered that our perception of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay our brains edit out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest connections between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.
Despite what some might think, science is far from complete. In fact, we seem further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. This has led top theoretical physicists to work on a ""Theory of Everything,"" aiming to explain all forces and particles in the universe with one equation. But for many, the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is like planting a garden. These two activities complement each other, creating a landscape I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, attracting bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started writing, I have alternated between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories, and after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. They might use different parts of the brain, and switching takes time. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about it, so it was difficult, but memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is joyful because they don't take long to finish. It usually takes about a week to shape a short story, though revisions can be endless. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I'll finish. Short stories offer a change of pace. You can create a story from small things – an idea, a word, an image. It's like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. If a story doesn't work, it's okay. Not every story is a masterpiece, even for great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. This is comforting. You learn from mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I learn from my short stories' successes and failures. Short stories are like experiments for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so short stories make writing novels easier. My short stories are like shadows or footprints I've left. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are guideposts to my heart, and sharing these feelings with readers makes me happy.'"
4,C2,"Science can be both abstract, like philosophy, and practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often falls short. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, its dangers misunderstood, and its importance both overestimated and underestimated. The mistakes of science and scientists are sometimes ignored or exaggerated. Science is full of conflict. Old theories are often changed or replaced, and new ideas are sometimes mocked before becoming accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. This book looks at science as a series of ideas that have changed not just science but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book focuses on ideas, their beauty, and their limitations. Science is always changing. Scientists constantly challenge each other's ideas. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they lead to major shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned this view, showing that observing the universe can change it. Some people see the changing nature of science as a weakness, but it often leads to better understanding and prediction. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but continues to progress. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was little left to discover, but then came many breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, and quantum mechanics. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some claim we are close to a complete theory of everything. Science is not just an intellectual activity. In the last two centuries, we have started to control nature, sometimes disrupting it without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the future world and future generations. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. The future is not just a topic for philosophers; it affects budgets, health, and even life on Earth."
5,C2,"From around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing, or even decreased in some cases. This raised new doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, with his company losing faith in 'the power of the printed word'. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will 'kill' print books keeps coming up. Whether people are predicting or dismissing this idea, the potential disappearance of the book continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a struggle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium 'killing' another often follows the introduction of new technologies. Even before digital technologies, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would die. But radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and on factory floors. The idea of the disappearing book isn't new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some feared the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. It's no surprise that the idea of the death of the book appears during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our hopes and fears about technological change. To understand why these reactions are common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we develop close bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it doesn't just mean economic and social change. It also means adjusting our bond with something integral to our daily lives. As technology advances, we often long for what we used to know but no longer have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about the disappearance of print books. Yet, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to be an appealing story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we make sense of change is by using familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings. Easy to remember and share, the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world – and ultimately, ourselves."
6,C2,"For a year and a half, nearly every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I focused on how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers. I wanted to show them as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the final product. It’s personal too. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something of your inner self. My book addresses questions I face in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to focus entirely on a project or to dedicate a small part of each day to it? When time is limited, do you give things up, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions, but I provide examples of how successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative visions translate into small daily actions and how working habits influence the work itself. The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it’s really about routines. Routines might seem ordinary, but they can be powerful tools for managing limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can help focus your mental energy and keep you from being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James was a procrastinator and struggled with regular schedules. This book was born from my own procrastination. One Sunday, instead of writing a story due the next day, I was tidying my office and wasting time. As a morning person, I’m focused early in the day but less so after lunch. To feel better about this, I searched online for other writers’ schedules. I found them entertaining and thought someone should collect these stories. That’s how the Daily Routines blog started, and now, this book. The blog was casual; I posted descriptions of routines I found in biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the original’s brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources. This book wouldn’t exist without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which can guide further reading."
79,C2,"One of the most interesting changes in higher education in the UK and worldwide is encouraging students to get involved in research early in their studies. This shift recognizes that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists at top universities. Instead, it is a natural and essential way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only in your studies but also in your future job, as they help you think about the world and approach your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by creating it, not just repeating it. This involves asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.
Research can range from groundbreaking, complex studies by highly trained experts to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about issues and practices. Most students have been researchers in some way, asking questions and investigating since their early days in school or work. You have used research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, or shopping online.
In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, critically evaluating information, and creating your own responses are expected learning activities. Some students may find this challenging, especially if they come from cultures where knowledge is seen as fixed and learned by listening to authority figures. In the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.
Critical thinking is crucial in research. While the research of others is useful, we must not just accept it as fact. We need to engage with it, test it, and determine if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should not rely uncritically on information given to us in reading or verbally."
80,C2,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London gathered in coffee houses to discuss topics like chemistry and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso talked about modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses that encouraged discussion also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities can inspire creativity, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. Although city life is known to be tiring, new research shows that it can also dull our thinking. One major issue is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for the brain. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function by giving us a break from the busy city life. This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we are in crowded urban areas with many strangers. These unnatural environments affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy street, our brains have to manage many things: distracted people, traffic, and the confusing city layout. This constant need to focus drains our mental energy. Cities are full of stimuli, requiring us to constantly shift our attention, which is tiring. In contrast, natural settings don't demand as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Natural environments capture our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge. Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer an escape from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While people try various methods to boost cognitive performance, like energy drinks or office redesigns, few are as effective as a walk in nature. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain hubs of intellectual activity. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that challenge our attention also promote innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities drives creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a center of intellectual breakthroughs, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are successful creative hubs. Less crowded cities may produce less innovation over time. The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people feel, ""I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city!"""
81,C2,"**Where is the Mind?**
Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious: thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging to support this. However, I believe the study of the mind shouldn't stop at the skin or skull. Evidence from prehistory to now shows that objects, not just neurons, are part of human thinking. Archaeology reveals that stone tools, ornaments, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have influenced human evolution and the mind. So, what is outside the head might still be part of the mind.
It's easy to see why the mind and brain are often seen as the same. Most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their usual surroundings. This is practical for neuroscientists using brain-scanning machines. But it often overlooks that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny the brain's role in cognition, but I suggest that the mind extends into culture and the material world.
This idea is central to my Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET explores how objects become part of our thinking, like making symbols from clay or using stones as tools. It also looks at how these interactions have changed over time and what that means for our thinking. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they work.
Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does their self begin? The stick and the person form a unit, showing how minds and objects are connected. The stick helps the blind person 'see' through touch, becoming part of their body. This example highlights the flexibility of the human mind, which adapts by incorporating new tools.
I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, tools—from stone tools to the internet—have been pathways for understanding the world, not barriers. Humans use tools to explore and learn, unlike other animals. This unique trait explains why humans create things and how these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds change as they interact with the material world.
MET offers a new way to understand how material culture, from ancient tools to modern technology, shapes and transforms our thinking. While ""mind-changing technology"" sounds futuristic, humans have been using it since our species began."
