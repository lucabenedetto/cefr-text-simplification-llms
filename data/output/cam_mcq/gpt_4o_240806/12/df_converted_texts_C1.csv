1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of public check-ins—announcing your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing awareness of the potential downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost. It might seem depressing, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame, all before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting online. At that time, the web was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teenagers like him. The web was invented at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and readers were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While it was the work of an exhibitionist, there was also a beauty to his project that some might call art. One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people want to be with you, you'll be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague anonymously sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our digital lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film combined documentary and drama to show that there is much about our universe that we don't understand. While scientists agree that we don't have all the answers about the universe, some were concerned enough to publicly criticize the film, calling it everything from ""atrocious"" to ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film intriguing to many. 

Initially, the film seemed harmless, with scientists discussing how new discoveries reveal the universe to be stranger than expected. However, the controversy arose when the film claimed that water molecules could be affected by thoughts. It mentioned a Japanese researcher who supposedly showed that the shape of a water molecule could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. The film supported this claim with pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being exposed to positive thoughts and looking unpleasant after negative ones. While some people found this evidence convincing, many scientists were skeptical, saying, ""Give me a break."" They argued that such claims need solid proof, and pretty pictures of crystals are not enough.

The real issue is that the film's claims weren't strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere, linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This idea is supported by decades of research. Recent discoveries show that the universe is indeed stranger than we thought. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" On a more relatable level, neuroscientists have discovered that our perception of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay our brains edit out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest connections between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.

Despite what some might think, science is far from complete. In fact, we seem further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. This has led top theoretical physicists to work on a ""Theory of Everything,"" aiming to explain all forces and particles in the universe with one equation. But for many, the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,"Text: 'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing a short story is like planting a garden. These two activities complement each other, creating a landscape I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, attracting bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started writing, I have alternated between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories, and after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. They might use different parts of the brain, and switching takes time. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about it, so it was difficult, but memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is joyful because they don't take long to finish. It usually takes about a week to shape a short story, though revisions can be endless. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I'll finish. Short stories offer a change of pace. You can create a story from small things – an idea, a word, an image. It's like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. If a story doesn't work, it's okay. Not every story is a masterpiece, even for great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. This is comforting. You learn from mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I learn from my short stories' successes and failures. Short stories are like experiments for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so short stories make writing novels easier. My short stories are like shadows or footprints I've left. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are guideposts to my heart, and sharing these feelings with readers makes me happy.'"
4,"Science can be both abstract, like philosophy, and practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often falls short. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, its dangers misunderstood, and its importance both overestimated and underestimated. The mistakes of science and scientists are sometimes ignored or exaggerated. Science is full of conflict. Old theories are often changed or replaced, and new ideas are sometimes mocked before becoming accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. This book looks at science as a series of ideas that have changed not just science but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book focuses on ideas, their beauty, and their limitations. Science is always changing. Scientists constantly challenge each other's ideas. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they lead to major shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned this view, showing that observing the universe can change it. Some people see the changing nature of science as a weakness, but it often leads to better understanding and prediction. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but continues to progress. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was little left to discover, but then came many breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, and quantum mechanics. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some claim we are close to a complete theory of everything. Science is not just an intellectual activity. In the last two centuries, we have started to control nature, sometimes disrupting it without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists must understand scientific advances because they affect the future world and future generations. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. The future is not just a topic for philosophers; it affects budgets, health, and even life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing, or even decreased in some cases. This raised new doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, with his company losing faith in 'the power of the printed word'. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will 'kill' print books keeps coming up. Whether people are predicting or dismissing this idea, the potential disappearance of the book continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a struggle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium 'killing' another often follows the introduction of new technologies. Even before digital technologies, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would die. But radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and on factory floors. The idea of the disappearing book isn't new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some feared the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. It's no surprise that the idea of the death of the book appears during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our hopes and fears about technological change. To understand why these reactions are common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we develop close bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it doesn't just mean economic and social change. It also means adjusting our bond with something integral to our daily lives. As technology advances, we often long for what we used to know but no longer have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about the disappearance of print books. Yet, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to be an appealing story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we make sense of change is by using familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings. Easy to remember and share, the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world – and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, nearly every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I focused on how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers. I wanted to show them as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the final product. It’s personal too. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something of your inner self. My book addresses questions I face in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to focus entirely on a project or to dedicate a small part of each day to it? When time is limited, do you give things up, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions, but I provide examples of how successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative visions translate into small daily actions and how working habits influence the work itself. The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it’s really about routines. Routines might seem ordinary, but they can be powerful tools for managing limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can help focus your mental energy and keep you from being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James was a procrastinator and struggled with regular schedules. This book was born from my own procrastination. One Sunday, instead of writing a story due the next day, I was tidying my office and wasting time. As a morning person, I’m focused early in the day but less so after lunch. To feel better about this, I searched online for other writers’ schedules. I found them entertaining and thought someone should collect these stories. That’s how the Daily Routines blog started, and now, this book. The blog was casual; I posted descriptions of routines I found in biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the original’s brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources. This book wouldn’t exist without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which can guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist due to an unexpected change in his childhood plans. When he was six, his family had to cancel a holiday to Spain because of rising interest rates. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. There, on a gloomy August day, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. This discovery sparked his lifelong interest in palaeontology. By the end of his university studies, Howard knew he wanted to focus on the earliest periods of life, rather than the more popular Jurassic era with its dinosaurs. He was fascinated by ancient, delicate creatures found in grey rocks.

As he finished his doctoral thesis, Howard worried about his job prospects. He was confident in his abilities but aware that deserving candidates don't always get the positions they want. When an Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London became available, he applied, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't attend due to an accident. His replacement, who disliked the absent professor, influenced the panel to hire Howard instead. Howard was initially grateful for the unexpected support, but later learned the true reason behind his appointment. He was slightly disappointed but ultimately relieved to have the job he wanted.

Howard often compared the structured nature of his scientific work with the unpredictability of life. He experienced this unpredictability firsthand when his briefcase, containing important lecture notes, was stolen at an Underground station. Frustrated, he returned to the college, postponed his lecture, and reported the theft. While having coffee with a colleague and a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, he learned about a new collection of fossils that needed study. This opportunity became his greatest professional challenge and secured his future. If not for the theft, he might never have known about the fossils. Within half an hour, Howard changed his plans, deciding not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding the funds to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they look like maggots, they have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Through his research on how our senses combine to create our perception of flavor, Spence is subtly influencing what we eat and drink. This ranges from the products of large food companies (he advises one major multinational and receives funding from another) to the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues, through a field known as gastrophysics, have studied in detail how we experience food and drink. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates and cutlery, and background noise all affect taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers fascinating insights for anyone who enjoys eating. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant tends to enjoy their meal the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence's lab in Oxford is quite basic. ""Low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff,"" he admits. There are soundproof booths that look like large safes, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can collaborate creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. Historically, research funded by industry was seen as less prestigious in universities. But now, since the government requires universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research is considered valuable. Spence is currently helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often due to government regulations. He notes that it's in their interest to help customers live longer. Surprisingly, many companies make these reductions quietly, so consumers don't notice the change. ""Research shows that if you tell people about the changes, they focus on the taste and don't like it as much,"" he explains. Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a major food producer. ""At the time, people thought: 'Science and food – that's horrible,' but most food is scientific. Who better to change that mindset than Heston?"" Through their collaboration, the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish was created at Blumenthal's five-star restaurant. Interestingly, Spence mentions that the Italian futurists, an early 20th-century art movement, were experimenting with sound and food a century ago, but it didn't catch on. Now, the food industry is widely applying Spence's sensory science. For example, his research shows that high-pitched music enhances sweetness, while low-pitched sounds make food taste bitter. ""It's always surprising when shapes affect taste, or when a tune can change how you perceive a flavor,"" he says. An airline will soon pair music with meals served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says happens often. One wonders what dinner parties are like at Spence's home. There was a time they ate rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery, and another when they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. ""We've had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and 10 different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, pseudo facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. Meanwhile, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We juggle multiple roles while managing our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows, with the help of our smartphones. These devices encourage us to fill every spare moment. However, there's a problem. We believe we are multitasking, but this is a misleading and risky belief. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching tasks quickly, which has a cognitive cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, switching tasks frantically and worrying about dropping one. Ironically, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can overstimulate the brain and cause mental fog. Multitasking creates a craving for distraction, rewarding the brain for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, the brain area we need for focus, is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask harms cognitive performance. Glenn Wilson, a former Visiting Professor of Psychology, calls this info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an unread email sits in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. The cognitive losses from multitasking are greater than those from fatigue. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong brain area. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to retrieve. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is taxing on the brain. Small decisions use the same resources as big ones, leading to poor decisions after many small ones. In discussions with business leaders, scientists, and writers, email is often mentioned as a problem. It's not the email itself, but the overwhelming volume of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and accomplish other tasks."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions would have been seen as irrelevant. Animals had behaviors, these behaviors produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. The idea that animals have consciousness, feelings, and moral systems was considered sentimental. But recently, this view has partially changed. Research into the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has led scientists to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". It has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness? This debate leads to another one: not about consciousness, but conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong. In a recent experiment with cows that had to open a locked gate to get food, those that opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure – by jumping and kicking their legs – than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but their interpretation is. According to Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" the only logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the verge of a major ethical revolution. According to Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. He suggests that animals have a simpler theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail argues that we should stop anthropomorphizing. The three may never agree because the issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Given that defining consciousness is nearly impossible, can we ever know, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asked, what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an experiment he did that seems to show starlings – a type of bird – can get depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. Half were housed in spacious cages with plenty of space and water. The other half were in small, barren cages. Initially, both groups were fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and soon learned to take only from the tasty box. But when offered only unpleasant worms, only the birds in luxurious cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. ‘We look back with horror on an era of racism,’ he says. ‘Our view about animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.’ If he were the only advocate of this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his view. Manning has written a textbook, ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" ‘What we are seeing is a pendulum swing,’ he says. ‘At the turn of the 20th century, some assumed animals thought like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are going the other way. But it is a contentious subject, and you want to avoid the sound of academics with personal grievances and strong opinions.’"
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way to engage deeply with what we read or hear. Adrian West, research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K. and a former computer science lecturer, notes that argument is often seen as a way to find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there is concern that it changes how we solve complex problems, making deep thinking harder. West points out that we are bombarded with poor yet appealing ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our reasoning. Surprisingly, despite having more data, our thinking quality hasn't improved much.

The National Endowment for the Arts reports a 10% decline in literary reading, with the rate of decline increasing. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, suggests that focusing more on visual media may reduce critical thinking. She notes that people now emphasize real-time media and multitasking over concentrating on one thing. However, there is no clear answer yet on how technology affects critical thinking. Technology's impact is complex, and different uses can lead to different outcomes. For instance, a computer game might enhance or hinder critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis, but constantly clicking links might prevent deeper thought.

Greenfield, who reviewed over 50 studies on learning and technology, says that technology changes how we think. While reading boosts imagination and critical thinking, visual media can improve some information processing skills. Unfortunately, most visual media don't allow time for reflection or analysis, leading many, especially young people, to underachieve.

Society's view of technology influences perceptions of critical thinking, especially regarding video games. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games can be beneficial for learning. Evidence shows that games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in realistic virtual settings. These games allow exploration of ideas that might be otherwise inaccessible. In the digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"When Matthew Crawford isn't thinking and writing about how we should live, he works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his job in social policy. His first book praised the benefits of manual work, and his latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for it while shopping, noticing ads on a credit card machine during a short delay. Crawford realized that these demands on our attention are hard to avoid. What we want to focus on is personal, but we are often unaware of what distracts us. It's becoming harder to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, we isolate ourselves and avoid simple interactions like chatting with strangers. Crawford says we experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us and take over our desires. He's not alone in his concerns. Many people complain about emails at work but then check them in their free time. Studies show our attention drifts if a phone is visible, a common experience for those distracted at dinner by their phones. There's no scientific proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. It's easy to blame technology, but Crawford believes it just highlights our self-obsession. With constant choices, our self-control is tested, affecting our social lives. We prefer texting friends to avoid real conversations. By interacting with representations of people instead of real people, Crawford warns we might lose something important in society. Screens are only part of the issue. He uses his gym as an example. It used to have one music player for everyone, which could cause tension. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds. 'The gym used to be social, but it lost that character. Real connections happen through conflict and resolving different tastes,' he says. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public. More importantly, he recommends engaging in skilled activities for a more fulfilling life. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real-world challenges. No representation can match the feel of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under tires. These roles require good judgment and managing others in the same space. 'When you engage with the world this way, artificial experiences seem less appealing,' he says. This doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but it's important to use your judgment. There are many benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions is tiring and makes it hard to focus on what matters. Focusing on one thing, however, makes it easier to pay attention to others."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. For most people, it's easy to answer. But for a philosopher like me, it's a bit tricky. Calling yourself a philosopher can sound pretentious. It might seem like you're claiming to have special knowledge. This isn't true; philosophers are just like everyone else. So why do people think this way about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation was the best life. While few modern philosophers agree, philosophy is still linked to deep thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that blindly following cultural norms is unsatisfying. Reflecting on life helps us make our own choices. But examining life doesn't mean reading lots of philosophy books. It means looking closely at our daily experiences to see if they are important. It doesn't require living like a sage, away from society. In fact, examining life is practical and should be shared, as it's part of a good life. Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from everyday life. This isn't entirely philosophers' fault. University funding and evaluations focus on expensive, hard-to-access journals. So, philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. To outsiders, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. If philosophers once challenged this view, many no longer do. The university system created this isolation, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy focus on specific debates, explaining them to non-experts is hard. Philosophy, in some cases, has withdrawn from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which evaluates human actions. But this title doesn't fully describe my work. Ethics is often linked to rules and laws. Recently, ethics has come to mean applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often explore them. But philosophy is more than this. A discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is unethical (it is) and then explore responsibility, attitudes towards art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps us examine the actions and beliefs that shape our lives. Sometimes we confirm what we know; other times, we find our beliefs are hard to justify. By examining these ideas, we benefit everyone."""
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies, gourmands, and chefs, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. Historically, though, philosophers have often used food as a way to discuss other topics. When philosophers talked about eating, it was usually a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, discussions seem to be about food, but they actually explore other, loosely related ideas. Take the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, for example. He promoted seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is now closely linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites, likely because businesses think it adds value if their products are associated with famous philosophers. Food is inherently social and cultural. It comes from historical contexts and is shared with our communities, providing dining companions and the systems for growing and distributing food. We interact with food more often and in more essential ways than any other commodity, making it a significant topic for philosophical study. Once food is prepared, critics start discussing and writing about it. But why do they have such a special status? One philosopher noted that tasting food is not a unique skill; influential food critics are just better at describing tastes. This area has been overlooked because philosophical studies on perception have mostly focused on vision. Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We often call paintings or symphonies beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in aesthetic discussions like sculpture or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike art or music, which lasts over time. This makes it difficult to consider food as an object of aesthetic value. There are many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices. Another topic is the difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of personal relationships. In home kitchens, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional cooks, however, have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are for qualified staff, and their relationships are professional. A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by appreciating others through their food and by forming personal connections with people from different cultures through shared meals. The essay includes many examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy engaging for readers.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, designs 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were no longer fun or challenging, so he started thinking about how they could change. Could they have a storyline? Could decisions made in one game affect the next? He changed a classic board game called Risk to create a new version: Risk Legacy. Unlike older board games, decisions made during the game had a lasting impact. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at key moments. The games are played over a set number of sessions, and long-standing rivalries become part of the game. Daviau explained: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’ 

Daviau was then asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular cooperative board game where players try to cure diseases threatening humanity. His next project was a board game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was widely praised, SeaFall was seen as the real test of the legacy format – the first game that didn’t follow an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players become explorers as they conquer a new world. Legacy board game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. To do this, designers use testers to see how the games will play out. Jaime Barriga was a play-tester on SeaFall. ‘It takes an insane amount of time,’ he said. ‘You’ll have a situation where it’s playing great, the first few games are perfect, then four or five games in it starts to get shaky, then game six it’s broken. Then you have to go back and redo everything.’

Legacy board games were never expected to become popular. When developing the concept, even Daviau thought it would be a niche interest. ‘When I was working on it I would think: “This is really different and I think it’s pretty good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s weird, it’s unexpected and it breaks a lot of taboos. I expected it to be very successful with a handful of people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this weird project.’ However, most players, like Russell Chapman, loved the concept. He sees it as one of the biggest advances in game design for several years. ‘It’s this new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than to learn a new game or way to do something and you’re getting that constantly with legacy games.’

According to another fan, Ben Hogg, the appeal of an unfolding adventure was more important than concerns about longevity. ‘There was that initial worry about making changes and basically wrecking your board as you went through,’ he said. ‘That has been put to rest by Pandemic Legacy. Most people don’t go to the cinema to watch the same film twice, do they? You’re buying into an experience. It’s introducing that aspect of narrative that you get from video games.’ The legacy format draws not only on video games but also on the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV series. While at college, Daviau saw his future as a television writer, but moved into advertising, then game design. Still, the appeal of telling stories stayed with him. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares the legacy design process to writing a novel. ‘You need to have an idea of how you want it to end and a pretty good idea of where you want it to begin,’ he said. ‘But also it’s not enough just to have an overall outline.’

While Daviau feels a sense of ownership, he is eager to see where others take the idea. But he also tries to downplay its importance. He thinks gamers will soon be asking: ‘Enough of that, what’s new?’ Colby Dauch, studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less sure. For him, the legacy format has been a revelation. ‘It’s the kind of idea that changes the way you think about what a board game can be.’"
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children's movie, was widely shared online. Stories like this, involving animals such as rats and llamas, often amuse us because we like to imagine animals behaving like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, whose intelligence is surprising given their different bodies. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

While anthropomorphism, or attributing human traits to animals, is often seen as unscientific, Dr. Frans de Waal argues that the real issue is ""anthropodenial""—the refusal to acknowledge human-like traits in animals. He has studied animal behavior for decades and found that animals, except for fully-developed language, show many behaviors once thought unique to humans. These include thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.

De Waal believes that anthropodenial is a modern idea. In the past, animals were thought to have complex minds. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial. In the nineteenth century, naturalists, including Charles Darwin, explored the similarities between human and animal intelligence. However, in the twentieth century, behaviorism, which focused on conditioning animals, changed public views. Animals were seen as machines or robots with instincts, and those who thought otherwise were considered unscientific.

De Waal is optimistic that we are moving past this view and starting to see animal cognition as similar to human cognition, though not identical. He notes the growing body of knowledge about animal intelligence shared online. Effective tests of animal intelligence consider a species' unique traits. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts. In her book, ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might focus on our ability to change skin color, and we would likely fail.

De Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape leading to the ocean, but he acknowledges that viral stories can increase appreciation for animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment showing that capuchin monkeys can feel envy. Monkeys given cucumbers were upset when others received grapes, a better treat. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video clip of the experiment released later convinced more people of the findings. This highlights the unique nature of the human mind."
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialisation. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for years, but experts now predict a big increase in their use across many industries. However, many countries are not ready for this change. While most people agree that robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, about 80% believe their own jobs will still exist. This belief is likely wrong, as robotic automation will affect every industry soon. For instance, the Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a task that would take two human workers much longer. In San Francisco, Simbe Robotics introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to ensure products are stocked and priced correctly. Supporters of robotic automation point out that robots still need humans to service and program them, which could create new jobs for skilled workers. Critics, however, worry about losing the human touch in workplaces. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will create laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field are expected to rise, but there will be a shortage of skilled workers. Zhang suggests that people should retrain to adapt to these changes, as relying on the government to protect jobs is not realistic. Advances in technology will also lead to new types of robots for consumers, like those that live in our homes and interact with us. This presents opportunities for businesses but also challenges, such as creating new safety and privacy regulations. With many jobs at risk, education is key to preparing for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, reportedly answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it's there."" The reporter's question reflects a common curiosity: why would anyone engage in such a dangerous and seemingly pointless activity? Mallory's answer might inspire some to pursue their dreams, challenging them to face the unknown. Its true value, however, lies in its simplicity, suggesting that climbing might be about adventure and fun. 

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay, ""Games that Climbers Play,"" identifying seven different climbing activities, or ""games,"" each with its own rules. He argued that the style of climbing, such as using more or less equipment, should follow the rules of the specific game. Over the years, this perspective has become central to climbing discussions in the West, influencing everything from magazines to debates.

For many climbers, the appeal of climbing is the sense of freedom it provides. Yet, climbing can also be restrictive, like being stuck in a storm in a tent. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and confining. However, the limited choices in climbing can also bring a simplicity that feels like freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen, in a recent essay, suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He offers an evolutionary perspective, saying climbing is in our genes. It's natural for humans to take on challenges and test limits, even with risks. Thus, the joy of climbing is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor, in another essay, argues that climbing helps develop virtues like courage, humility, and respect for the environment. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing, therefore, has practical value, helping people develop qualities that are useful in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who don't rely on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred controversy by claiming that independent climbs, which are harder and riskier, deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or artificial aids like bottled oxygen. Their essay may have encouraged some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Exploring climbing beyond the Western perspective, climbers often describe being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, meditative focus, and intuitive problem-solving are key aspects of climbing. Some argue that climbing parallels Zen techniques for achieving mental peace. This offers another perspective on why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Over sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known for his intellectual and sometimes serious approach, focusing on European piano works. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he rarely taught. Those close to him saw a playful side, but this was not often shown in his concerts. His life was a disciplined routine of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert, asking for lessons. At first, Brendel was not interested, as he had taught very few students and saw no reason to start. He quoted another famous pianist, saying, ""You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk."" However, something about Kit, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. After hearing Kit play beautifully from memory and listening to a CD of his recital, Brendel decided to teach him. He was impressed by Kit's ability to lead a performance from start to finish, which is rare.

As Brendel steps back from public life, Kit is beginning to make his mark, though Brendel is cautious about him burning out. Now 19, Kit is always busy, learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under his mother's watchful eye. He also composes music. Brendel believes composing is important for understanding music better. He noticed Kit's exceptional memory and sight-reading skills, as well as his ability to listen and apply feedback.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations too high. He was upset when a newspaper called Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, as such statements can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit excels in some areas but needs more time and experience in others. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

At 80, Brendel reflects on his career with a sense of calm. He says, ""When I was young, I didn’t aim to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them, but there was room for more, so I continued. Although I lack physical strength now, my mind is active with music I’ve never played. I don’t perform anymore, but it’s a nice new phase."""
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden wasn’t in a dirty city; it was by a river and sloped gently towards the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places of escape, peace, and solitude. Grandad’s garden wasn’t special in terms of features. He didn’t have a greenhouse like some neighbors, who made theirs from old window frames. They patched them with plastic when glass broke.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved, but he wasn’t without humor. He enjoyed using phrases like ‘It’s immaterial to me’ instead of simply saying ‘I don’t mind’. He probably felt disappointed for not achieving more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn’t passionate about. He wasn’t very ambitious, though he and Mum once considered moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was skilled at home repairs, like building bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing furniture. Just as we got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the brass candlesticks on it, which my mother removed. I was never offered piano lessons; they were for my sister. When I asked my mother later why I wasn’t given the chance, she said, ‘You’d never have practised’.

Of the three options – moors, woods, or river – I usually chose the river. I could escape into another world there. With a fishing net and old sandals, I’d find a spot to take off the sandals and look for fish to catch. After failing to keep them alive at home, I’d return them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father mentioned a job opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. He thought I might be interested. Although he might have preferred me to become a carpenter, I like to think he saw my passion for gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening himself, he noticed my enthusiasm for plants and flowers."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches on the Isle of Muck, a small Scottish island, and I do the same. An Atlantic storm threatens to blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen remains calm and at ease on his island. He introduces me to the area, pointing out nearby islands. ""That’s Eigg,"" he shouts, ""and to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do."" I see rain clouds over Rum's mountains. ""Beyond Rum is Soay,"" he adds. Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep, and we head down the slopes. As we walk, he tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide, its geese eat a lot of grass, and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Our conversation pauses as we herd the sheep. Tie, the sheepdog, struggles with the task. ""Away to me, Tie,"" MacEwen instructs, but the dog causes confusion. ""Tie,"" he says, disappointed. The Isle of Muck is mainly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin oversees the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their children can explore the island freely. However, island life has its challenges, like limited electricity. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on. The next morning, Mary prepares breakfast by torchlight. I adapt to this, along with no mobile phone service. ""There’s reception on the hill,"" Mary says. ""Most people give up after a couple of days."" I do the same. Life on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians. Their concert in the tearoom is a hit, with islanders tapping their boots to the music. That night, by the fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on Soay without seeing it, and Jenny was sent to manage it, despite only having typing skills. I fall asleep to the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. I eat well, with most food from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish, which I bring back to her. By 7 pm, the fish is on the table, tasting incredible. The next morning, I’m supposed to take a ferry to another island. Many ferries have been canceled due to rough seas. If mine doesn’t come, I’ll be on Muck for two more days, which I secretly hope for, phone or no phone."
22,"The game design industry was once mainly for computer scientists and self-taught individuals, with few entry paths. It was often seen as a hobby for young enthusiasts, but now it's taken seriously. Industry experts aren't surprised by this change. Creating video game spin-offs for new movies requires large teams and months of hard work. Like many industries, it's hard to enter, but it's growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says it's tough to make progress in big companies or influence major games. However, the industry needs more game designers, not just directors but also those who design systems and set pieces.

How can you enter this competitive field? While many companies prefer a computer science degree, Jim believes the key is to make games. The tools are available, and you need to create something to get a job or succeed independently. Game design is more a lifestyle than a job. John Field, another expert, agrees but adds that it's more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry's demands. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit needed.

Can you succeed alone? John says it's difficult, but a good postgraduate course can help by providing support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and arts. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and their diversity. Networking is also crucial for success in the industry.

The stereotype of a teenage boy playing games has changed. Now, games are seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families play on interactive consoles, and smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. Games are popular with large audiences and are a great way to learn, offering many opportunities."
23,"Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me, but he didn't force me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was young. Only by practicing can you score spectacular goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I emphasize enjoying learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope his habit of kicking them around doesn't mean he's like me in that way. At the start of my professional career, the manager made sacrifices so younger players could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never told us, 'This is your big chance,' but we knew it was. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely on close friends and family a lot. Having a lot of money can cause problems. People sometimes say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' I've helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car. My family is strong and would be offended if they were on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I enjoy using my money to help those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off to do things I've missed. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. Out of desperation, he offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father couldn’t write anything sellable in Los Angeles, and Sam was worried about losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn’t popular with day-trippers. The road was uninviting, and the nearby resort of La Carmella was more appealing for those with some money. Only if you were broke or loved surfing would you go the extra mile to Reef Point. But with the hot weather, the place became crowded. After months of being almost alone, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to meet a script deadline and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to adopt us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I gave him water, and my father half-heartedly threw a boot at him. Rusty knew he was welcome and stayed. I asked my father who Rusty might belong to, and he said, ‘You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. One surfer stood out with her style. She finished for the day and came over to me. ‘Hi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’ ‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’ ‘You could get one.’ ‘No money.’ ‘You’re British, aren’t you? Visiting?’ ‘No, I live here.’ ‘Is your father American?’ ‘No. He came here to write a film script of a novel he wrote.’ ‘No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’ ‘Rufus Marsh.’ ‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that cover to cover.’ She looked at me with new interest. It was always like this. They were friendly but only interested when I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long queue at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie, who often traveled, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this time the advice was wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers explained there was a 'breakdown in the computer system,' causing frustration among the passengers. Many felt they had paid a lot for this trip and were disappointed by the delay.

Violet felt uneasy about the cruise and realized she had lost her phone, which was more troubling than the long wait. She couldn't contact the minicab company to check if she left it in the taxi because all her important numbers were stored on the phone. Her son Harry had always warned her about this kind of mistake. She borrowed a phone from a friendly couple in the queue to call Harry, leaving a message for him to ask their neighbor Kristina to look for her phone in her flat. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York.

Harry often thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding but shared her forgetfulness. Violet finally moved forward in the queue, handed over her travel documents, and boarded the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be grand, with fake walnut panels, chandeliers, and airport-style carpets.

She followed signs to the elevators, which were lined with mirrors and crowded with tired passengers. Violet was pressed against the side of the lift as it stopped at each floor, releasing passengers. Finally, she reached the twelfth floor and was relieved to find her room had the balcony she requested. She had paid a high price to ensure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he discovered 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing striking images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent morning, Maloof stood among these items, realizing he had stumbled upon something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ For some time, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together Maier’s life story. They contacted local families who employed her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, known for being private and a bit eccentric, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although not very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed passionate about her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was created for commercial reasons. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and the abstract. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or was she a lifter of ideas from those who came before her?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof began taking his own pictures. ‘As I progressed as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.’"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often hints at some failure. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when the book's success had made her very popular, yet she remained calm, especially since she was still in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the official, who then asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in 1860s New Zealand. A series of crimes have occurred, and a group of 12 men gathers to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton said she intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. At over 800 pages, it is ‘big by necessity’ because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters ‘a decent show’. When I ask how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responds modestly. ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels the success is partly theirs. There’s a very familial feeling at home, I got a lot of back pats from other people’s grandmas.’ Then she adds, ‘What is annoying is when it is assumed that what I’m trying to do in the book is not a philosophical enterprise.’ ‘I had the idea to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part was half the length of the one before it,’ said Catton. It literally speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters whether the reader notices these things. ‘I wanted to create a book with structural patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them.’ Despite its experimental structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with an engaging plot. Surprisingly, she says she didn’t plan it all out beforehand. ‘I would try to write myself into a corner, then see how imaginative I could be in writing myself out of it.’ It’s clear she also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We also discuss her love of TV drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue, I ask if she might be interested in screenwriting. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says. Her conversation is lively, with a low, conspiratorial laugh. She lights up when talking about her craft and New Zealand. ‘I always notice when I come to Britain how much the landscape of my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to crowded areas, to have that saturation of other human beings.’ But for now, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I am not alone in hoping it provides her with the inspiration she needs for many more novels."
28,"As a child, Jonny Kinkead loved using tools in his dad’s garage and playing the guitar. These hobbies became his career for the last forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still fascinated by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood create such a beautiful sound? And how do different types of wood make different sounds? It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a job and save up for one,’ he says. ‘But I believed in making things myself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and woods affected the sound and how to build them.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ‘We designed and built model boats and planes, so I knew the process. My father taught us to use saws and sharpen chisels. I also customized and repaired instruments for friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar was successful, but he hadn’t thought of a career in guitar-making. ‘I was also interested in painting and sculpture,’ he says. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he recalls. However, he left halfway through the course. ‘I was too individualistic,’ he says. ‘But I realized I wanted to build guitars. It’s like sculpture – shaping sound. And it seemed more practical than pure art because you make things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. His first guitars sold for just the cost of materials, but as he became known as a top guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, nearly forty years later, Jonny says he’s ‘still just getting by’. He admits he can only make ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to get noticed. He went to music festivals most weekends to let musicians try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which didn’t come naturally to him. Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were worth having,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as authentic, even though we’ve always had good instrument-making courses and the skills have stayed the same. But now our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says valuable techniques can be learned in classes, and he encourages new instrument-makers to take courses. However, he believes there’s no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny advises. ‘If you make the back too thin or thick, it won’t sound good. If you’re taught by someone else, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’"
29,"Text: Any discussion about English conversation often starts with the weather. This is a tradition, and like many others, I will mention the famous comment by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist, who said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This observation is still true today. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why English people are so interested in the weather, but they often fail. They mistakenly think that when English people talk about the weather, they are actually interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson notes that English weather is not very exciting, lacking extreme events like tornadoes or blizzards, and finds the English interest in it puzzling. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because of its unpredictability, not because of dramatic events. My research suggests that both Bryson and Paxman miss the point. English weather talk is not really about the weather; it is a social tool to help people start conversations. Phrases like ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" are not about the weather itself but are used as greetings or conversation starters. This type of talk is similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially. There are specific situations where weather talk is used: as a greeting, to break the ice, or as a filler when there is an awkward silence. This frequent use of weather talk can make it seem like English people are obsessed with the weather, but it is more about social interaction. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, use weather talk to break the ice, and return to it when needed, giving the impression that English people talk about little else."
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an impressive engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build a structure 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were already interested, having chosen this trip over more glamorous destinations like Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the Wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were lacking. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to provide context and human interest about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from a 31-year teaching career, Alice began a new career as an author in 2001. Although she had a successful teaching career, Alice felt she was venturing into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting; it’s a daily performance and physically demanding. Writing is exciting and nerve-wracking, but not as exhausting. My former colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my fiction.’ Alice aims to fill a gap in children’s fiction. ‘Many adolescent books today focus on negative experiences. They are well-written,’ she adds, ‘but often dark or completely fantastical, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’ Alice always linked English and History in her teaching, using novels like Tale of Troy alongside lessons on ancient Greece, driven by her love for children. ‘I’m fascinated by the moment a child goes from being bored to interested, and from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because then the challenge is on me to engage them.’ She views her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was inspired to write her first novel due to a gap in the market, the idea also came from her approaching ‘empty nest’ as her sons left home, and a suggestion from her head teacher to attend a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday on a course I didn’t think I needed.’ Before attending, she had to submit her best piece of fiction, a requirement she learned about just days before leaving. ‘I sat at the computer and created a story about a Roman couple and their unborn child.’ Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, other students reviewed her work, gave excellent feedback, and suggested she publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as evidence of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, critic and editor Zachary Leader, was crucial in editing her novel. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve written – he reads a chapter, changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, suggests different words. My instinct is to keep adding scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to a unique race. The race would pit man against car and brother against brother in the Yorkshire Dales of northern England. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while his younger brother Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. ""I’m looking forward to it,"" Jonny said at the start line. ""I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I’ll stay warm in the car."" Alistair was also eager, wearing full winter cycling gear, unlike Jonny in jeans and a sweatshirt. ""To be honest,"" Alistair said, ""I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race began at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would end at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, 350 meters up. The car might have an advantage, but Alistair faced a tough start with a steep 25 percent incline. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sprinted on his bike up the hill and across the country to Fleet Moss, while Jonny got into the car and hit the road. The next time they would see each other was at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s confidence was quickly tested. Just 15 seconds into the drive, a giant tractor blocked the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he joked to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!"" After passing the tractor, Jonny continued into the mist. Meanwhile, Alistair struggled with the slope. A few miles in, he had to carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the summit. With open ground ahead and the sun shining, Alistair picked up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another challenge. The narrow village roads were not built for speed. He slowed to a crawl to navigate a tight corner and a stream on the road. Once clear of the village, he raced to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping, he reached the line and braked. Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, ""Is he here?"" When they said no, he celebrated. Minutes later, Jonny arrived. ""Well done,"" Jonny said, disappointed. ""I’m gutted."""
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a feeling of being enclosed from the outside world. The quiet helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hard to focus only on the contest and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but as if from far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused that I forget there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my lifelong coach, taught me early on that this was the biggest tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost twice, both times against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The 2006 defeat wasn’t so hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer beat me easily, more easily than if I’d believed in myself more. But losing in 2007 left me devastated. I knew I could have done better; it wasn’t my ability that failed, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and waste it. Toni, a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me; he criticizes me even when I win. But seeing how upset I was, he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might have been my last chance. I know how short a professional athlete’s career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more, and I let a big one pass in 2007. Toni couldn’t ease my grief, but he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just a year later. I was confident I’d learned from that defeat; this time, my mindset wouldn’t fail me. The best sign was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family and friends the night before the final, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t forbid it, but they knew I was already playing the match in my mind. Until the start of play, that space was mine alone.'"
33,"A young, idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in April 1957. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society helped make her famous by producing articles and TV documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame sometimes overshadows her real achievements. Many articles and books about her life focus on her adventurous spirit, her dreams of living with wild animals, and her role as a feminist, but these stories can undervalue her work. Based on the number of academic references to her research, the success of her students, and the data from her 40-year study, Jane Goodall should be seen as a pioneering zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.

Before Goodall's work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew they ate meat or used tools. We didn't realize they shared emotions with humans or had social systems like ours. We also didn't know that chimpanzee communities across Africa had different cultural traditions. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her long-term study in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements by biologist Stephen Jay Gould. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives.

Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. At five years old, in 1939, she disappeared one afternoon. The police and neighbors searched for her. When she reappeared, she explained that she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity foreshadowed her future as a biologist."
34,"Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist known for her work in children's TV, cartoons, and educational programs. During our conversation, she demonstrated her ability to switch between different voices, including a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an amusing elderly Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Shirley explains that doing voiceovers is more than just creating funny voices; it's about bringing scripts to life for an audience that can't see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceover work, but they often don't get roles because they're used to acting with their whole bodies.

Shirley started her career with a drama course, intending to become a traditional actor. However, she got her break in voiceover work when she was asked to audition for a rabbit in a cartoon. She found success in this field and realized it was the right path for her. Shirley often voices small boys and girls because her voice is lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures that production companies prefer to avoid.

Her work ranges from cartoons to educational videos and adverts. She finds cartoons particularly enjoyable because of the interaction with other actors. Shirley emphasizes the importance of a good showreel to showcase an artist's abilities, as competition is tough. She attributes her success to persistence and setting goals, recommending specialist workshops for those interested in voiceover careers. Shirley is passionate about voices and often finds herself speaking in different accents even after leaving the studio. Her children are used to hearing her talk in various voices."
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a dream job for many kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more practical careers, like becoming a tax lawyer or working in auto parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems unrealistic. Yet, some people do become cartoonists. Most cartoonists have wanted to do it for a long time. In my case, I loved comic strips as a child, contributed to school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and showed my illustrations to different companies after graduating. I was fortunate to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons on local issues. I created some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was earning enough to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical barriers are low, but it's still a challenging job. You shouldn't try to become a cartoonist unless you feel you can't do anything else. It's easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don't turn down work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don't really want to do. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of cartooning? There was a time when many cartoonists had regular jobs with newspapers and magazines, but those days are ending. Today, cartooning is mostly an entrepreneurial activity. You have to create and sell your work. Cartoonists with average talent but good business skills often do better than artistic geniuses. It's surprising how many people are afraid someone will steal their ideas, even if they've never sold a cartoon. Some are so worried they won't show their work to anyone. To protect your work, just draw a 'c' for 'copyright,' circle it, and write your name and the date. But realistically, it's more likely no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving house and decided to clear out some things. I chose to throw away an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. Normally, I hate getting rid of things, so why did I want to throw this away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to discard it when a young man approached me, looking confused. ""You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?"" he asked. I said I was, already feeling a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I agreed. We went our separate ways, but I felt a constant regret afterward.

A few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. The email was from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He wrote, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on it and used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was overwhelmed with emotion. Keith's price was fair, and I was grateful. I had forgotten my dad's habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have found this story amusing.

My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s when it was popular. I loved its calming sound, but I struggled to make progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the era of punk music, where you didn’t need to be a great musician to be a rock star. When I received my guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I instinctively stood up and put a strap over my shoulder, as the electric guitar is meant to be played standing. My fingers remembered the chords, even though I couldn’t draw them. My fingertips felt the familiar pain of pressing the strings.

The electric guitar isn’t really a solo instrument, so now that I’m learning it again, I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or perhaps there are others my age with similar experiences. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Insomniacs, whom I interviewed in large numbers, will tell you that sleep is crucial for our mental, physical, and social well-being. Those who struggle the most with sleep often understand its importance the best. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? They haven't been discussed much. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, the stage rich in dreams. Our most vivid and emotionally powerful dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they experience more intense REM the next night to make up for it. This suggests dreams have a purpose. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding the mind. However, later research did not support this idea, and the study of dreams shifted to their physical origins. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams better than others. He concluded that dream use increases with interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don’t all people, like teachers, software designers, and politicians, need to think creatively? Stickgold says dreams help us combine things in new, surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create combinations that break our usual thinking habits. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ignore the obvious and make unexpected connections, which is what creativity is, according to Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, or one barely remembered, seems to fuel my thoughts. On those days, words and images flow so quickly that my fingers can hardly keep up. I don’t know how it works, but it does. Creativity isn’t just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world, and we all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, which has a stunning sea view, you see empty frames on the walls alongside photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading figure in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate the richness of early-20th century impressionist works and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Despite her talent, she doesn't keep any of her own work. ""As soon as I finish them, they go,"" she says. Susie is in high demand. Over her 30-year career as a copyist artist, she has recreated works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that even art experts can mistake them for the originals. While the originals could sell for millions, her copies sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie keeps her clients' identities mostly private, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, while others are motivated by status. One celebrity claims to own a Van Gogh, but it's actually a ""Susie Ray Van Gogh."" ""Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,"" she says. ""That's up to them."" Some collectors use her copies to save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank safe. Susie is transparent about her work. She makes her reproductions look as authentic as possible, believing that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as an original is illegal, and although she knows people who have profited from it, she has never been tempted. Those who make fakes often face consequences. Susie mentions that she isn't wealthy and has faced struggles, but her situation is more stable now, and risking her reputation isn't worth it. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. It was a good foundation for her current work and sparked her interest in plants, though it was hard to live on. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets but is glad to have found something more financially rewarding. When young artists ask for advice, Susie emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights the extensive study required to do her work. Her skills allow her to do anything from drawing plants to copying 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art. She now focuses on French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas as her favorites. Susie notes that people often think modern art is simple, almost like children's work. Impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also meticulous, making their style challenging to replicate. Despite her skills, Susie doesn't create her own original art. Isn't art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She says her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and it provides a good living. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—good, but not exceptional. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing career, nothing was more important to Ellen MacArthur than the sea, except perhaps being the fastest on it. From childhood, she was obsessed with sailing. She had a unique connection with the boats that took her around the world; they worked as one. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly longed to be back at sea, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and workplace for 94 days. She explained the detailed planning involved, like calculating the exact number of kitchen paper rolls needed. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly displayed her stock of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. The boat was her world, and she cared for it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her think about how humans take what they want and move on. When I visited her office, she had just finished a heated conference call. She explained why urgent action is needed to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways not to use them up,"" she said. Initially, her message was to use less, but she realized there was another way to see things. Now, she focuses on re-using, passionately discussing ideas like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, Ellen has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says, ""but I love learning. The current situation became something I couldn't ignore. Sailing seemed selfish in comparison. This is about finding how my voice can be most useful. It really matters."" She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It defines me. At sea, you are connected to everything around you, focused on records, practicalities, and survival. My new message isn't as simple as saying, 'I’m going to be the fastest person around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this is more important than anything I've done."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and aims to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his time. With many young people spending more time on computers and video games, he hopes to inspire them to climb their own mountains or at least spend more time outdoors. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero,' and climbing Everest is just part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to complete the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent. Few achieve this before turning thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might complete the challenge before he turns 20.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agreed a young climber might have the physical strength but doubted if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also questioned if a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions during such a climb. The Romeros are aware of these opinions. Paul says, 'I know there's criticism, but I can't focus on it – there's still so much to do. Karen and I consider the risks all the time, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He's becoming strong and mature.'

I also wonder about Jordan's motivation. Is this just an ambitious father pushing his love of adventure too far? Paul insists, 'This isn't about me trying to become famous through my son's achievements. At first, Jordan talked about doing it later in life, but we thought: 'Why not now?' We regularly check with him to ensure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

In the past, few cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting challenge. The more daring the record, the more interest it attracts. This creates a dilemma for Jordan. While we might say that achievement often overshadows enjoyment, if Jordan wants to inspire others, he must engage with the media. This means blogging, photo shoots, and interviews. He needs to offer something spectacular, like climbing Everest. 'And you know what?' Paul says. 'If Jordan decides tomorrow that he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we'll end this project and head to the gym.'"
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they're not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but my classmates don't know much more about classical music than others our age. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't own their music. The statistics are discouraging for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells just 300 copies. I find that surprising. So, why has interest in this centuries-old music declined? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who attend classical concerts, but they're a minority. Although I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big classical music fan. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm, with many mood changes, are challenging for us. We like to talk, play, and think fast. Experts say we struggle to focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more appealing than long classical pieces without lyrics. Classical music is powerful but doesn't address teenage concerns. How we listen to music has changed. In the past, families made music together at home, and playing an instrument was valued. Concerts were the only other way to hear music. Now, you can find any music online, but our lives rarely feature classical music. When did you last hear classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says classical concert audiences have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play in various places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why people prefer classical concerts in middle age, but if your parents love something, you might avoid it. Some blame schools for teenagers' lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are eager to play in school orchestras. They practice early and stay late to rehearse. They enjoy performing classical music, but it's not their first choice for listening. The two activities are separate. When we relax, it's always pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you regret I’m here,"" she said to the school with a smile. Her mother, who was getting out of the car from the other side, didn’t hear her, but Bonnie wouldn’t have minded if she had. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham glanced around. Almonside was an unusual school, with buildings scattered among trees on a wooded hillside; it seemed confusing at first. Then she noticed the signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother replied. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved through the trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of trailing behind like a dog,"" Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, but she didn’t seem to expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be expelled soon enough,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and headed towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was a charming old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. Bonnie always treated horses well. The horses were well cared for, she could see that immediately. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, examining each horse. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, running her finger along its nose. The next horse caught her attention. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she exclaimed. He was brown with a bit of white. Probably lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and saddle for you. They must be nearby."" The room with the riding equipment was – to Bonnie’s delight – unlocked. Focused on the enjoyable task of saddling Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, ruler of all she surveyed. Her nickname at her previous school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said admiringly, ""and I’m not joking, because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She urged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,"" she confided. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was thrilling, a breeze brushing her cheek and making it glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he’d jump well."
43,"I've met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released several successful songs. So how did a laid-back surfer end up on stage in front of thousands of fans? ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven,"" Cody says, recalling how it all began. ""But I was swimming every day and surfing. Those were the things that meant more to me back then; I had my life set up and so much to occupy my time. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online."" These videos changed everything. He started with a video of a friend and himself singing at a school concert. Fans sent online comments saying they wanted more of his videos on their social networking sites. So Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The responses were overwhelming. Cody was a very talented swimmer. He was training hard with some of the best coaches and focusing on perfecting his sport. But then record labels came calling, and he had a tough choice to make: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a huge risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the plunge. ""It was very difficult for me – especially at such a young age – to have to choose a career for myself. Can you imagine, at 12 or 13 years old, trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. ""It came as a big surprise to most people. I'm kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked expressions. ""I'm very modest, and I think it's important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and went with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream in the hope of making another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn't directly involved in his career, they are there in the background. Cody says it's important to keep a tight circle of great people around you to make sure you stay grounded. Of course, we all have days of doubt. ""Sometimes when I'm left alone for a while, I sit and think, 'How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?' My little brother's eight years old, and he's traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn't have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about the effect of that on him sometimes, but my family's always reassuring me that they're here to support me and encourage me in everything that I do."" Success, in whatever career you choose, comes from a willingness to say ""yes"" to your big break, even when it's a little scary to do so. ""It all just happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be going to countries I never thought I'd visit in my life, and to be playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it's like something that I think lots of people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won't last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, lifted a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbag wall, which was there to protect the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags into place. Last week, I worked long hours with most of the town's adults, showing I could handle it. But my grandfather didn't seem to notice. With one hand still on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the wood processing factory in Milltown. Fragile ice shelves were on either side, and solid ice was downstream. As I took off my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. I didn't recognize him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there—a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Having this chain is better than having a famous grandfather, and only he, my mom, and I know about it. Plus, I have his diary from that journey. I keep it under my pillow and read parts of it before I sleep. I patted the chain again and headed to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled as I grabbed a banana from the counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ As if my wetsuit didn’t make that obvious. As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s getting harder. ‘What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. His words stung, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say he’d always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero—from the time he showed me his photos in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty expedition medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. Yet, a part of me still wants to stay devoted to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly Grandpa's work, but different from anything he had done before and obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. A river dominated the scene; it wasn't a river she recognized and might not even be real, just imaginary. The picture was strange and shapeless, yet beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green, drawing the eye into the pale waters and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, too detached, revealing her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed to have a strange importance to her, though she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. Maybe he'll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't resist. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to every idiot..."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""...every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually to say the muse wasn't being kind to him that day, or that he needed to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"Text: 'When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, 'Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.' It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm quite unlucky that way. Actually, I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute! It's small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it: shepherdesses, milkmaids, and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it has to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But since Angela is only fifteen, I'll be in my broom cupboard for years. I don't really mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom... Then I had an idea. If I couldn't cut the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to 'think outside the box'. And that's exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house, secretly taking things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be difficult to meet fans' expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' perspective, not the humans', which made filming more complex. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' view; they wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I especially remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act at all. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it almost impossible for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off as she was sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home had to be shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren’t accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work quickly – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully captured the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren’t there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the requests for free concert tickets from my dad. ""Everything’s going to be fine,"" I reassure her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out. Then she drives off, leaving me to face this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted—to leave my old life of touring and tutors. While the band is renting here for recording, we’re staying permanently. I chose this school because I want to meet regular kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal. 

I walk into the school’s main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she mishears, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused but types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. Luckily, few people recognize my last name because my dad uses a stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it’s printing,"" she says, then hands me the schedule. English Literature is first period. Great, I like English. I’ll be late, though. It’s in Room 214 on the second floor. I studied the map last night to avoid looking lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already taking roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles, noticing my jeans and T-shirt. Ha! No one will suspect anything now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive platforms with embroidered flowers. Oops, maybe not the best choice. ""Thanks,"" I reply. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says. ""Here."" She smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After discussing the books we’ll read, she lets us socialize. All teachers should do this. ""So why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have options. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But I can pretend to be normal for now. ""He’s an artist,"" I say, fiddling with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way."" And she doesn’t seem to care. Perfect."
49,"Text: 'The average American teenage girl today is expected to be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is the reality for American teenagers now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and stay unnoticed, because being average is no longer enough. Mediocrity is not acceptable, and lacking ambition is seen as laziness. ""People, often adults, forget how much pressure teenagers face these days. We have lots of homework, tests, extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to maintain a social life,"" says teenager Kristen Loose. Despite these pressures being common in teenage life today, negative stereotypes of teenagers still exist, often spread by the media. You know the stereotypes: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. While there is some evidence of these traits, labeling the entire generation this way is not fair, according to some. ""Many people assume we spend most of our time watching TV and using our cell phones,"" Loose says. She believes this assumption is mostly wrong. She admits to keeping her cellphone nearby most of the day, but not for trivial reasons. It's not just for texting friends; it's a tool that teens use to make their lives - and the lives of those responsible for them - easier. Students today are expected to have immediate access to the world and be reachable at all times, which can seem like a cell phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work with them and do homework anywhere. Instead of listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate but require 24-hour attention from already busy teens. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. Their schedule is full of school, after-school activities, family duties, and homework. Then, they must get up and do it all again the next day, with less than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation surveyed American teenagers and found that about 20 percent get the recommended nine hours of sleep. Moreover, 28 percent of teens admitted falling asleep in school about once a week due to lack of sleep. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all her activities, she gets about 18 hours of free time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is not much. Olsen rarely spends those hours on social media or TV. Instead, she focuses on volunteer work. ""I think the stereotype of teenagers is that they have a narrow view of the world, focusing only on themselves and their immediate interests,"" Olsen says. Despite this image, Olsen says her favorite part of the week is volunteering. ""I love serving others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community during the week."" In 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but they will still be proving it wrong and pushing the world forward. There will be another generation of students taking the world by storm, all before they leave school.'"
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live near Bishop, a mountain town in the US, east of the Sierra Nevada. Over the past few years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above Earth. This science project combines astronomy with adventure, attracting teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring as they prepared to launch a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These occur when space rocks or metal enter Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As night fell, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside were a camera, an altitude instrument, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by a nearby enthusiast, inflated the balloon to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For these kids, that's normal. Finally, it was time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chanted, and the balloon rose. Some tracked it with flashlights, lighting up the creamy orb in the moonless sky. There was a quiet, shared sense of wonder. Then the balloon vanished into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets, gazing at the clear sky, just four hours from Los Angeles, a bustling city of 4 million. I saw a boy fall asleep in a sleeping bag. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ a girl whispered. ‘I know,’ another replied. A meteor streaked across the sky. As the balloon rose, air pressure decreased, and it expanded until it burst. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely. The students would find it the next day using GPS. Retrieving it wasn’t easy, but that was part of the fun. The lunch box usually landed in remote areas around Bishop. ‘Recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, noting they lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘We’ve learned about this landscape in ways we wouldn’t have otherwise.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. The recovery team had to drive south of the Sierra and back up the western side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or tall tree. ‘These students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to them.’ It took 11 hours to find the lunch box, which was on a flat rock in a waterfall canyon. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars, which was disappointing, but it sparked discussions about atmospheric waves over mountains. It also became another adventure story to share."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. Her interest began by chance when she helped her younger brother with a science project. She found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology, which fascinated her. Chloe knew then that she wanted to pursue this field. Palaeontology wasn't a common career choice for young people at that time, so I asked her about the support she received. She recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. Chloe was nervous at first, worried he might find her annoying, but he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

I asked Chloe about how palaeontologists are portrayed in movies and TV shows. She admits that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She finds the portrayal of palaeontologists in films misleading, often showing them as eccentric geniuses or geeky figures who struggle to relate to people. Chloe explains that her job is varied, involving digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs, analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. Communicating scientific findings to the public is also important to her, especially to young people, to help them understand science better.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, where she advised on the accuracy of the dinosaurs portrayed. She praises the makers for their knowledge and says she mostly checked that the dinosaurs shown lived in the same time period. The documentary attracted audiences of all ages because it depicted dinosaurs more accurately than movies like Jurassic Park.

I asked Chloe why dinosaurs continue to fascinate us. She believes they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. In a world that seems smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us that there is still much to discover, and Palaeontology offers a form of time travel."
52,"Text: ""Let me say this clearly: when you're on a car trip with your family, even at six years old, you probably know you're not 'there yet,' even if you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' And really, once you arrive, it's not 'there' anymore; it's 'here.' So, if you think you might be 'there,' you should ask 'Are we here yet?' No one wants to be 'there' more than the parents who hear that question repeatedly on long trips. Seriously, what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs you haven't seen, listen to music, or do puzzles, while the scenery passes by outside. In the front seat, mum or dad is there to hand out snacks, change the radio, and keep everything running smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone does something annoying—like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it's his other foot, then a hand, and soon he's in my space, and a fight starts. The driver and co-pilot separate us, telling Tim to stay in his seat. Peace returns for a while, and the scenery continues. Then, as I'm reading, I feel a breeze on my arm. The window's not open, so where's it from? Tim is blowing on me from his seat, not touching me, so he's technically not doing anything wrong. The anger rises. Tim gets scolded, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again. Over the years, Dad has found ways to handle us in the back seat. When we ask 'Are we there yet?' he often says, 'Yes, we're here. Get out.' 'But Dad, we're on the highway!' 'Oh, maybe we're not there yet.' That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you're finally 'there' when the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids who have been bothering them. So remember: if mum and dad can still answer your question, then no, you're not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where customers can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and return. Zuzi explains their motivation: ""With so much technology, everyone is busy on their phones. We wanted to bring people together without screens. It's natural for us to connect and communicate."" The games in their café are called 'Eurogames', known for gentle themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, by German designer Klaus Teuber. Players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged. This idea was developed further in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging social interaction. Pandemic, a Eurogame by North American designer Matt Leacock, requires players to solve global problems together. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame based on Lord of the Rings. He recalls playing it with friends and feeling a range of emotions, wanting to create a similar experience. As a child, Leacock loved board games but often felt disappointed by them. With his uncle's help, he started designing better games. Pandemic was a huge success, and its sequel added storytelling elements, similar to video games, where characters develop and the world changes. Surprisingly, the growth of video games has helped board games succeed. Video games have made gaming more common, and many people now play games on their smartphones. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, says, ""Everyone's a mobile gamer now."" Video games once offered social interaction in arcades or with friends at home, but online gaming made players physically distant. Some people missed playing games with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, games are a way to connect in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are crucial in the music industry, even if your career starts with setbacks. Jamie's mother was a great singer and introduced him to the guitar. Growing up, he only listened to a local radio station for middle-aged people, which influenced his musical taste. He was 12 when he first heard a contemporary song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. Although he was good at tennis, he realized it wasn't his passion. At 17, he left school to pursue a music career. He formed a duo with a friend who was a decent guitarist but not as committed to a music career. Jamie told his parents about his dream, explaining that he wrote lyrics during economics lessons and played the piano while others played outside. His father gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he signed with a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels wanted him as a solo artist, so he parted ways with his friend. Ultimately, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a challenging time with a UK record label, he switched to another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune didn't follow. Jamie feels that in his artist career, he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, he was in the right place. Writing for others became his strength. He believes he is one of the main writers UK labels rely on to help new artists launch their careers. Sometimes, he explains to artists that aiming for chart success is nothing to be ashamed of. He asks them, ""Don't you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?"" He emphasizes creating songs that both he and the artist think are amazing and likely to sell well. In a world of false modesty in pop music, Jamie's straightforward desire to write number-one hits is refreshing. He isn't arrogant; he simply knows he wants to write hits and has the talent to do so. Instead of worrying about others' opinions, he focuses on his goal. ""That's the endgame when I go into the studio with someone,"" he says. ""We aim to write the best music of next year, not just what's cool. We want to create classic modern pop songs."""
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity: a big star online but probably unknown to people who don’t watch online videos of bike stunts. He is a ‘street trials cyclist’ who jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I interview him at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, the local boys know who he is, and even older people come to praise him, calling him ‘an absolute legend’. After seeing his skills, I agree with them. Although I was skeptical at first, I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains his plan, and I often doubt he can succeed. However, when I praise him, he seems indifferent and a bit downbeat. Despite his online fame, Tony says he is a reluctant celebrity. ‘I find the social side difficult. I see the value of connecting with fans, but I prefer doing things rather than talking about them.’ This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. ‘This technology allows people like me to make a living,’ he says. ‘Sometimes I feel everyone is focused on cameras or screens, and part of me doesn’t like that.’ But he’s not complaining. The videos allow him to earn a living from what would have been just a hobby in the past. After years of interviewing top athletes, I’ve learned that two important factors turn an enthusiastic child into an elite competitor: energy and the ability to overcome emotional disappointment. These qualities may be more important than talent and help athletes persist despite failure. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength is needed. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what were easy but unfamiliar obstacles for him. He just got up and kept trying until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some say he’s reckless and takes unnecessary risks. He responds, ‘Those who say this may be concerned but are not well-informed. They probably haven’t ridden a trials bike and don’t understand the sport. They don’t know the technical details and don’t realize I get expert advice to minimize risks.’ Tony is careful about the risks he takes. ‘People are different. Some never get scared and shouldn’t do these sports; it’s wise to be aware of the dangers. Others can’t overcome fear, but I’m in the group that feels fear and finds a way past it. I’m not addicted to risk and spend hours planning and preparing. Sometimes I ride around to get in the right mindset before a new stunt. I know I mustn’t lose my nerve before I jump. If I commit fully, I’m fine.’"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on several dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. Her latest challenge involved walking on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick weighing eight kilograms. Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she quickly learned that high-wire walking was very different. ""The training was a shock,"" said Helen. ""I didn’t realize how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she admitted afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old bicycle with one large and one small wheel. He had already written a book about his travels in Canada in a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it for a holiday trip to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further from home I got, the more amazed people were by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. A serious fever left him bedridden in a hostel for ten days without medicine. He had no money for hospital bills or to return home. Despite this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that lets us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have plenty of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat. The work is tough. There are four of us, each working six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and note every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but more often it's wet. It's so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a lab analyzing our results. It will be hard to be indoors, but it's necessary. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is crucial to ensure that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from my company. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, and spend time selecting the best ones for our chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I test and taste products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues. My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to work in during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm at our food lab, and other times I'm traveling abroad to buy raw materials, which can be challenging with a young family. But I love the variety and lack of routine, although the chocolate itself is my favorite part! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more in the evening!'"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air above an amazed audience. During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can watch some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s important to keep performances fresh and exciting. If you want to succeed in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train daily to stay strong. Training is crucial, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or only work a short time each year. But the real issue is planning for the future because you can only perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also includes business planning. Many former students have started businesses worldwide and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a profession for making money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!”"
61,"Text: 'You might not know her name or face, but you've probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers. That's not true—they often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! 'What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,' she says. 'It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by producers' requests. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job!' 'Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There's often no printed music to refer to. I'll never forget my first experience recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra as well. I was terrified: I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough as they are.' 'One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always know which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it.''"
62,"Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge of fashion but has built a successful business with her 'satchels'—traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous stores and are popular with many celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning, instead of just going with her first thought. Once she chose satchels, not everyone agreed with her decision. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had no career experience but had a natural talent for business. The design inspiration came from children's storybooks. Although Julie wasn't familiar with fashion blogs, they played a key role in her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would mention them in their blogs. They did, and interest grew, as did the speed of production. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is spotted with a satchel! While other companies spend on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied her design to sell similar products, so now she ensures she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices—people love working there. There's now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Fortunately, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, bringing young people together as part of a larger group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people doubt whether celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it for their own publicity, which can overshadow the charity’s real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother. Ana first sang in front of an audience at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to gain confidence. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional. Although she was the youngest, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher didn't listen to her, so she wrote Something to Say about her frustration. She posted the song online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled across Ireland to invite her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn't know the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. Joss assured her this wouldn't happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a fantastic evening. Ana prefers writing songs about difficult times rather than happy ones because she feels there's more to express. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes fans enjoy her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an incredible trip—a guided group tour by boat along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, though that’s not something we have in common. But I had always wanted to visit the area since seeing it on TV as a child, especially because our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally agreed! A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we planned to visit. Fortunately, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. Although there was a lot to organize, I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about it. But Harry assured me he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying. After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people lived along that coast, and indeed, the only other living creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was wonderful to stop worrying about time. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like stress-free living! When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I return to normal life? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. As a child, I often went to watch his games. You might think that this would make me love basketball, but it actually had the opposite effect. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually brought a book to read instead of watching the games. When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session but felt I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I agreed to play against another school. Having my parents watch made me nervous, but it turned out fine! For the next four years, I practiced every day and did well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA at fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't enjoy being far from my parents at first. At home, I couldn't spend much time with friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly! I turned professional at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most professional players since I was fifteen but needed to gain weight for my height. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After considering several options, I trained to become a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, making it feel like a new experience every time. After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be simple, but I discovered that to get a licence, I needed to know much more than I had learned. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent guide. Tour guiding isn't just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group. You need to be entertaining, tell interesting stories, and react to changing situations, like if a place is unexpectedly closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour without hearing about problems. I need to ensure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might post negative reviews online. Good reviews are important because they attract more customers. That's why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy usually result in very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Although she is five years younger than me, we get along quite well. We volunteered at an elephant sanctuary, a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first time doing something like this. However, there was no need to worry in the end.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. They eat large amounts of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meal made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a room, so space was limited. We chose this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and vegetarian, which we both prefer. After dinner, the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she realizes how lucky she was to go. Maybe she will return one day—I certainly will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people for their friends or homes; we have a variety of customers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of it. My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often colder and darker than I'd like, but that's normal for that time of the morning, so I don't mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I'd probably only pick pink ones because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what customers want can be different. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can't find what customers want. I don't enjoy negotiating prices with the flower-sellers, but it's part of the job. Flowers aren't cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we check customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we create bouquets and calculate the cost of orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy figuring out how to make the nicest arrangements for the money someone wants to spend. That's what you have to do when you're selling things – I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films, including many for kids on weekends. It's close to where I live, but a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which created the perfect atmosphere for the film, and it was fantastic! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We’re happy just to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we've sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still plenty to do, but when people of all ages tell us what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. The website has been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs across the country. We’ve visited to see how things are done in different places, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know most people now go online for film information, rather than read local paper reviews. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. However, nothing is as effective as word of mouth – people recommending us to their friends. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month, it was a movie quiz, which everyone enjoyed."
71,"Text: 'As a child, taking photographs was my favorite activity. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I decided to start a personal project: taking one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I began. After a few weeks, I uploaded these photos to a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and share my photos with others. I was surprised to find that people liked my perspective and photos. I enjoyed photographing different subjects. Then, someone suggested that my project would be better if all the photos had a common theme. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from other young photographers who took color photos. I sometimes doubted my project and almost quit several times. However, I trusted my instincts and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough for a professional career. Now, I have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.'"
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because they offered activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking, which I had never tried before. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you complete a level, you receive a certificate. When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this because I had attended the same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. I decided to accept the challenge, mainly to earn my first NYC certificate. However, I soon wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. After completing the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had formed great relationships with the children. Now, I volunteer there for about four hours a week and always look forward to it. Because of my experience at the children’s club, I have decided that after finishing school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. This was not something I had considered before joining the club. In fact, I had never thought about my future career, and youth work had never crossed my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have earned several other NYC certificates now, including one for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to think about snowboarding myself, but my dad loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I managed well. After that, I quickly developed a love for the sport and improved my skills. I started competing at ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for competing and winning has grown stronger as I’ve gotten older, which motivates me to push myself. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes it works out well, like when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. In the summer, I focus on training and studying since there’s no snow. I train daily, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with friends. It helps me cope with not being able to do what I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also want another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or get injured. I’m considering becoming a doctor if I can balance it with my active life. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it forever."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had and never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a valuable lesson from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I found it easier than I expected, even though it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery pieces to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. To see if others would like them, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists visit my town, and they bought my jewellery as gifts. Soon, we got calls from people all over the country wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just the two of us at a market stall! That's when I realized it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, ""Because of my father’s job, my family moved around a lot, so I got good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, starting at a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination for that.""

Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she had won first prize in a short story competition on a young writers’ website. Because of this, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publisher, they were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was available in bookshops.

One review of Being Amelia notes that even though the cover shows happy teenagers, the characters face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer says that although Janine is young and her novel isn’t very long, she has shown she is a better writer than many bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being famous: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. I’d like to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, spending time with friends gives me ideas to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. It all began when my father was offered the job of managing the castle. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was excited because he thought he might not get such a great opportunity again, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were mainly thinking about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we moved, though, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle isn't particularly beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very lively in summer because it attracts many visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island, which often involves a lot of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day back to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days when there are huge waves – but the ferries don't run then! And I've learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I'm always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, though, it's so foggy that you can't see anything, then within hours, it's brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it's been here for centuries – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I’ve always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m close to achieving that because on family holidays abroad, I’ve seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I’ve learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it fascinating and commented on it. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before I was introduced and walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they’d really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would rush home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a decent player. However, my family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and one referee noticed I was talented. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. She was impressed and invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first—I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But I started training regularly with a big club at 13. I improved a lot. Still, some people doubted I’d become a star player, which upset me. But my coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in a championship match earlier than I expected! I ran harder than ever—I didn’t want to be blamed for losing. By luck, I scored the winning goal. Despite the large crowd, I could hear my coach cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and let them meet other players from my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to believe they can play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach’s advice to me—you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few bad times, though, so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in higher education in the UK and worldwide is encouraging students to get involved in research early in their studies. This shift recognizes that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists at top universities. Instead, it is a natural and essential way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only in your studies but also in your future job, as they help you think about the world and approach your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by creating it, not just repeating it. This involves asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if things were different? These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can range from groundbreaking, complex studies by highly trained experts to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about issues and practices. Most students have been researchers in some way, asking questions and investigating since their early days in school or work. You have used research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, critically evaluating information, and creating your own responses are expected learning activities. Some students may find this challenging, especially if they come from cultures where knowledge is seen as fixed and learned by listening to authority figures. In the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged.

Critical thinking is crucial in research. While the research of others is useful, we must not just accept it as fact. We need to engage with it, test it, and determine if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should not rely uncritically on information given to us in reading or verbally."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London gathered in coffee houses to discuss topics like chemistry and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso talked about modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses that encouraged discussion also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities can inspire creativity, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. Although city life is known to be tiring, new research shows that it can also dull our thinking. One major issue is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for the brain. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function by giving us a break from the busy city life. This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we are in crowded urban areas with many strangers. These unnatural environments affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy street, our brains have to manage many things: distracted people, traffic, and the confusing city layout. This constant need to focus drains our mental energy. Cities are full of stimuli, requiring us to constantly shift our attention, which is tiring. In contrast, natural settings don't demand as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Natural environments capture our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge. Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and sought ways to include nature in urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer an escape from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While people try various methods to boost cognitive performance, like energy drinks or office redesigns, few are as effective as a walk in nature. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain hubs of intellectual activity. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that challenge our attention also promote innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities drives creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a center of intellectual breakthroughs, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are successful creative hubs. Less crowded cities may produce less innovation over time. The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people feel, ""I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city!"""
81,"**Where is the Mind?**

Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious: thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging to support this. However, I believe the study of the mind shouldn't stop at the skin or skull. Evidence from prehistory to now shows that objects, not just neurons, are part of human thinking. Archaeology reveals that stone tools, ornaments, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have influenced human evolution and the mind. So, what is outside the head might still be part of the mind.

It's easy to see why the mind and brain are often seen as the same. Most of our knowledge about the mind comes from studying people in isolation from their usual surroundings. This is practical for neuroscientists using brain-scanning machines. But it often overlooks that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny the brain's role in cognition, but I suggest that the mind extends into culture and the material world.

This idea is central to my Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET explores how objects become part of our thinking, like making symbols from clay or using stones as tools. It also looks at how these interactions have changed over time and what that means for our thinking. This approach offers new insights into what minds are and how they work.

Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does their self begin? The stick and the person form a unit, showing how minds and objects are connected. The stick helps the blind person 'see' through touch, becoming part of their body. This example highlights the flexibility of the human mind, which adapts by incorporating new tools.

I see the human mind as an ongoing project, always evolving. Throughout history, tools—from stone tools to the internet—have been pathways for understanding the world, not barriers. Humans use tools to explore and learn, unlike other animals. This unique trait explains why humans create things and how these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds change as they interact with the material world.

MET offers a new way to understand how material culture, from ancient tools to modern technology, shapes and transforms our thinking. While ""mind-changing technology"" sounds futuristic, humans have been using it since our species began."
82,"Photography has greatly influenced civilization, especially in the United States, where it quickly became part of the culture. It has been used in many areas, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians consider photography to be one of the US's most significant contributions to the visual arts. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Photography was appealing for several reasons. First, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing interest in technology, reflecting a national mindset that embraced change. Like steam power and railroads, photography made the world feel smaller by bringing distant sights into people's homes. Second, the camera was a tool for self-representation, allowing people to create and share images of themselves in a country where identities were constantly evolving. Third, it helped families create records of themselves, even if these were somewhat idealized. Lastly, photography's realism aligned with the US artists' focus on everyday life.

Photographs draw attention to what the photographer wants us to see, and because they are made by machines, they are seen as objective records of reality. However, they also reflect the photographer's perspective, adding a subjective element. While photographs are often called a 'universal language,' their meaning can be complex. Images are influenced by the context in which they are presented, such as captions or their placement in media. To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and how it was first viewed. The same image can have different meanings in different contexts.

In recent decades, artists like Andy Warhol have used photographs in their work, showing that photography is not separate from painting but an essential part of it. Photographic vision has become integral to our understanding of representation in art."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some understanding of what this means. Although the concept can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains somewhat elusive. James, like most psychologists, was mainly interested in human psychology. He believed it involved basic elements: thoughts and feelings, a physical world in time and space, and a way of knowing these things. This knowledge is personal and private, coming from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and may not always align with scientific facts. We often act as amateur psychologists, offering opinions on complex psychological issues, like brainwashing or why people behave in certain ways. Problems arise when people understand things differently. Formal psychology provides methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in a situation. Psychologists help us distinguish between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and scientific facts. Psychology, as defined by James, is about the mind or brain. However, psychologists do not fully understand the brain's role in our hopes, fears, and behaviors. It is difficult to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by studying behavior and forming hypotheses about internal processes. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not directly observable. They must be inferred from behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, involving evaluating and interpreting clues. These clues come from careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical analysis. Complex interactions are common in psychology, requiring sophisticated techniques and theories. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control or modify processes. Achieving these goals helps us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life. Psychological research has been useful in areas like teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping emotionally distressed people communicate better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or reflecting on one's own experience, to answer questions. They aimed to identify mental structures, but introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only reveals a small part of brain activity. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Modern psychologists prefer to base theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a unique place known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays products that were taken off the market because they didn’t sell well. You can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola there. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, believes each product tells a sad story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business. Many companies don’t keep their own collections of failed products, so executives visit the museum to learn from these mistakes.

The museum was started by Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, who wanted to create a ‘reference library’ of consumer products. He began collecting new products in the 1960s, not specifically failures. However, he discovered that most products fail, so his collection naturally became filled with unsuccessful items. This reflects a culture of optimism where people often overlook potential failures. Marketers might even invest more money in failing products to try to boost sales and save face, rather than understanding what went wrong.

This optimistic mindset is also common in the self-help industry, where ‘positive visualization’ is popular. The idea is that imagining success makes it more likely to happen. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot suggests that humans are naturally inclined to be overly optimistic, which might have helped our ancestors survive. Her research shows that well-balanced people often overestimate their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression who have a more realistic view.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen has studied whether positive fantasies about the future are effective. Her research found that thinking too much about success can actually reduce motivation. For example, people who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our reaction to failure depends on our beliefs about ability. People with a ‘fixed mindset’ think ability is innate and see failure as proof they lack talent. In contrast, those with a ‘growth mindset’ believe ability develops through effort and view failure as a chance to improve. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger after being pushed to their limits. Having a growth mindset is a more positive way to live, regardless of success."
85,"Text: 'It's well-known that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing rapidly, and what we once believed is now being questioned. Two main factors challenge the traditional view of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists are exploring what helps players perform at their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, financial interests question if home advantage should matter at all. If players are paid well, shouldn't they perform well anywhere? 

What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their support is crucial for the team's success. Fans often think their cheering leads to goals, but they forget the times when their support didn't result in success. However, one fan belief is supported by science: home fans influence referees. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This suggests referees avoid decisions that would anger the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England's Football League won 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar. Despite these changes, home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the highest home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball focuses more on individual matchups, while basketball relies on teamwork. Playing at home boosts team confidence, which is crucial in team sports.

Another factor is the players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This might relate to a natural instinct to defend home territory. In the recent Rugby World Cup, underdog teams won at home by showing determination and refusing to be intimidated, demonstrating home advantage. As one referee said, 'It’s the law of the jungle out there.'"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous among athletes and coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with claims for other golfers too. Its meaning is also puzzling. Player didn't mean luck literally; he meant, ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ This idea relates to the nature-nurture debate: is talent born or made? However, it's not really a balanced debate. The focus has been more on nurture, the idea that practice is more important than natural talent. This view is supported by psychologist Anders Ericsson, who proposed that 10,000 hours of practice can make anyone an expert. His theory inspired books like Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, which argue that practice is key. But, as David Epstein argues in his book, this is not always true. Epstein points out a flaw in studies of excellence: they often only look at successful people. He explores why some people have certain abilities and others don't, considering factors like environment, support, and determination. Epstein travels worldwide, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to Alaska, where he learns that in sled dog races, the dogs' drive might be genetic. This suggests that determination might also have a genetic component. Epstein distinguishes between 'hardware' (nature) and 'software' (nurture) and believes both are needed for elite athletes. He acknowledges the role of training and environment, suggesting that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a basketball player. However, Epstein also highlights cases where genetics are crucial. He examines race and gender, asking why men and women compete separately if only practice matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most important."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are spending too much time indoors, in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature. This, she argues, is the main issue. This idea is supported by other discussions about modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Adults over 40 often remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they spent time exploring outdoors, which they believe was healthier than the protected lives of children today. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have created these protective environments for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book includes strong arguments about the fear of outdoor dangers and how it benefits the toy and gadget industry, which sells products to keep children entertained indoors. She also criticizes trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. While some of these regulations might be exaggerated, Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly and passionately. She also discusses childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules.

Despite her appealing arguments, Griffiths sometimes takes her ideas too far and ignores important counter-arguments. For example, she compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children, often seeing them in an idealized way that might not match reality. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks, arguing that they need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Additionally, not all children may want the adventurous lifestyle she promotes. Some children are naturally more cautious and prefer staying at home. Perhaps the real issue is forcing all children into the same mold, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this skill doesn't come from my schooling. Most life problems can't be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play, and those with more to learn play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how mammals, including humans, have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, moral lives can't be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is crucial for economic success. We don't need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate obstacles, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We can't teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on imposed questions with one right answer. More important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit anytime. If you can't quit, it's not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue the game. This makes play the most democratic activity. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and pressure for high grades has grown. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They result from social factors like parents' fears, experts warning about dangers, declining neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children don't need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to play and explore to grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow direct contact with potential employers, similar to standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, this access also increases the risk of mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to use her contacts to find a job. The executive, offended by this request from a stranger, rejected him and sent a sarcastic note that went viral. Many who saw the note online were shocked, and the executive might regret her harsh tone. Yet, this incident highlights the importance of using social media carefully for professional purposes. Social media can be risky for job seekers who misuse it, and many are making mistakes. 

Ironically, social media has been central to the social lives of twentysomethings for years. For my generation, it was a way to escape from parents and teachers, a place to impress and experiment. It was often based on fantasy, where you could have long conversations online and ignore the person in real life. You could change your image overnight with a new Facebook profile picture or song. But using social media for professional networking is different, and some young people struggle to see the difference. We learned to be bold and confident online, which might explain why some still think this works. Just because many people liked your Facebook posts doesn't mean you can impress employers on LinkedIn. We need to understand that our teenage social media skills don't apply in the professional world, and we must meet employers' expectations to succeed.

One common complaint from employers is that young job seekers are too familiar and seem arrogant on professional networking sites. This reinforces the stereotype of an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are desperate to find jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This perceived arrogance can harm their job prospects, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees. So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, generic messages, and keep a humble tone to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can help you make useful contacts, but it requires careful use to avoid closing doors."
90,"Text: 'Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main news source for only 26% of people, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people predict that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were outdated, but theatre survived alongside newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has thrived in the TV era, and cinema has competed with videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but they only became the main news source in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. This was also when people started to believe that everything is constantly changing and we need regular updates, a concept unfamiliar in medieval times. Now, we expect change. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and unexpected disasters like famine or disease. Journalism as a profession barely existed before the 19th century, and there was no clear reason for regular news updates. Regular newspaper publication can be limiting. Online news allows readers to check updates based on their interests. Search engines and algorithms help personalize news. Online news can provide minute-by-minute updates and correct errors quickly. There are no space limits, and full documents can be accessed. This is very different from traditional newspapers. However, online news often focuses on being first and creating excitement, rather than spreading understanding. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we are returning to that. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction, or they might find a way to help us understand our complex world.'"
91,"If humans were truly comfortable under the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many nocturnal animals do. However, we are creatures of the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a fundamental part of our biology, even if we don't often think of ourselves this way. This explains why we have transformed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to damming a river, bringing benefits but also causing problems known as light pollution. Light pollution happens because of poor lighting design, which lets artificial light spread into the sky instead of focusing it downward. This unwanted light changes the natural darkness, affecting the light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it impacts life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding.

For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would have been meaningless. Imagine approaching London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's largest city. Nearly a million people lived there, relying on candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and public gaslights wouldn't appear for another seven years. From a distance, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We've illuminated the night as if it were empty, but that's far from true. Among mammals alone, many species are nocturnal. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. It's so powerful that scientists describe songbirds and seabirds as being 'captured' by searchlights or gas flares, circling until they drop. Birds migrating at night often collide with brightly lit buildings, with young birds on their first journey being most affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours due to artificial light.

It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. While most of us don't need an unobstructed view of the stars, we do need darkness. Ignoring this need is pointless. Darkness is as crucial for our health as light; disrupting our internal rhythms can lead to health issues. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping reflects the Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so essential that disturbing them is like changing our center of gravity. Ultimately, humans are as trapped by light pollution as frogs near a brightly lit highway. Living in our own glare, we have disconnected from our evolutionary and cultural heritage—the stars and the natural day-night cycle. Light pollution makes us lose sight of our true place in the universe, forgetting our scale, which is best understood under a deep night sky with the Milky Way overhead."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently announced that his company will stop tracking employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder said the idea came from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by his media team. Ignoring the way the announcement was made, we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn't harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads. In a large company, it's harder to be sure that taking time off won't affect the business or your career. No matter how much you prepare before a holiday, work will pile up while you're away. This is just how taking leave works. Employees might feel guilty about taking time off, leading to stress and lower productivity. There could also be pressure from colleagues about who takes time off and when. In the corporate world, there's a culture of working late, which could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave. Without the security of statutory leave, employees might feel they can't take the time they need, fearing they look lazy. This could result in employees not taking their entitled leave or sticking to their statutory rights, making the policy pointless. Modern technology blurs the line between work and free time, as employees can receive work messages anytime. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees questioned how the new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If employers can't track work hours accurately, why apply an outdated standard to time off? However, without set working hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might feel their work hours are being watched, leading them to self-monitor, which can be harmful. Employment laws exist to ensure workers get enough rest for their health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like increased morale and productivity, can happen without affecting worker well-being. I doubt that allowing unlimited holidays is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper before it is published. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research by preventing flawed papers from being published. This process can delay publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trustworthy research? The answer is both yes and no. Examining these issues reveals much about the current state of scientific publishing, which is changing. While I still support some form of review before publication, I notice a shift happening. The increasing use of preprints—drafts of papers shared online without peer review—is a key part of this change. Preprints allow for the quick sharing of new research so it can be read, critiqued, and built upon. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which can distort the motivations of authors and reviewers. The competition for spots in top journals encourages scientists to do their best work, but it also leads to cutting corners, as stories without inconvenient data are more likely to be published. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is suitable for a journal based on its newsworthiness rather than its scientific quality. These issues are known, but few are willing to change the system. However, as biologist Ron Vale suggested, preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a major change from the norm. Although preprints have existed for twenty years, they are not widely used. This is partly due to scientists' conservative nature and the misconception that journals won't accept papers posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review could lead to 'junk science,' but this hasn't happened yet. Authors know that preprints are open to critique by a global community. Psychology professor Tanya Elks shared her experience: her paper critiqued another paper, which traditional journals handle poorly. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and all comments were public, allowing readers to judge the arguments' quality. Even if journals reject the paper, the preprint and comments remain available, so the work isn't wasted. Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions that were once private. They can also be a place for sharing negative results, which journals often overlook. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing their effectiveness in spreading research. By using the internet's openness and the collaborative spirit of the scientific community, preprints can help focus attention on the research itself, not just where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say things like ""a painting in words."" These answers usually don't satisfy any of us. One day, I asked a group to pick an object and write two paragraphs: one describing it scientifically, and another from the object's perspective, titled ""Poem."" Here's what one student wrote:

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I'm a device that helps people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and even then for a short time. Most people will never need me.

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class understand how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to laughter and meaningful discussion.

When I was in school, poetry often seemed confusing to me. I saw each poem as a puzzle that blocked true understanding and emotion. After school, many people find poetry less engaging. Occasionally, you come across a poem, and it stands out because it's not continuous prose. It almost challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down by its simplicity or because it’s hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying.

What do we expect from poems? Aren't they supposed to hold deep emotions, beautiful images, thoughtful reflections, or sharp wit? The answer might seem to be yes. But for tears, we turn to movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels offer us worlds to escape to, paintings give us visual pleasure, and music – well, nothing quite matches the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody.

However, one thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life, unlike reading sentence by sentence, is full of it. But these thoughts still don't define what a poem truly is. If you search online for ""poem,"" it redirects to ""poetry"": ""a form of literary art using aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language."" This is academic language, but it hides the word's roots. ""Poem"" comes from the Greek ""poí?ma,"" meaning ""a thing made,"" and a poet is ""a maker of things.""

So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – precise and human-made – depending on their view. But these comparisons don't hold up under scrutiny. The value in trying to define a poem through comparison is not in the comparison itself but in the discussion it sparks. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps the mind explore new ways of thinking and see ordinary things differently.

The idea of a poem as a mental object is not hard to grasp, especially if we think about how song lyrics can stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody has a strong effect, like schoolyard rhymes such as ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But aren't words sometimes like sticks and stones?

Consider a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, staring at you: A poem can hit home like nothing else, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is created through writing and rewriting, just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a commodity. Publishing houses send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to cover printing costs. A poem presents itself not as a market item, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money and could have been used for something more practical for the house. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has brought me joy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot known for old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I couldn't ignore it and started digging. Half a metre down, lying in the mud, I saw a rounded, golden object. I tried not to get too excited, thinking it might be brass. But as I cleared the dirt, it turned into a beautifully patterned loop. I stopped and stared, realizing it looked like the Great Torc from the British Museum, a famous piece from Iron Age Britain over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a twisted necklace of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to my car and couldn't stop looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. I called Marion, saying, ""I've got something for you."" She came in, stopped, and asked, ""What is it?"" I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on, fearing we might damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe, but anxiety kept me awake. Eventually, I hid it under a floorboard in my office.

The law requires such finds to be reported within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before giving it up, even taking it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned, stopped mid-sentence, and stared. The torc was authenticated and sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find; it's something I've saved for the nation. People ask if I'll stop detecting now that I've found something so amazing. But those brooches and coins are still interesting. Like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I won't stop while there's a chance of finding something even bigger."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite parts of traveling, but I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When friends describe their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian sheets? Better sleep is a happy side effect of travel. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. Even with noisy birds nearby, I could sleep deeply and dreamily, more than I thought possible. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I don't think just relaxing explains why travel sleep feels so different. I believe sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we encounter new sights, sounds, and smells. We absorb new cultures, music, and landscapes. During sleep, we process all this new information. That's why sleep feels more intense when traveling. Sleep also changes with each place. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. In Trinidad, for example, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to adjust to this pattern. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, where I shared a big meal with new friends. After eating, everyone slowly stopped talking and moved to hammocks and sofas to rest. I realized why there were so many pillows around. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is memorable. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my dreams. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said diplomatically. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking like a bulldog. ""But it's so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black mini top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she decided, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about Jen's friend, Tattie, whom they knew nothing about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia's husband Jeff had commented, ""What sort of name is that?"" Mia explained, ""It's short for Tatiana. I think it’s nice."" Jeff, who disliked anything pretentious, replied, ""More like something very affected."" He also didn't believe in being overly polite, unlike Mia. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and might have even joked that a dustbin lid would suit her better. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. Her commute was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends that there was a demand for the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. After Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women came from miles around to her showroom in Little Pelham, where they could try on many hats in a relaxed setting. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"It's a long journey from London to Atlanta, and Lawrence Okoye is reflecting on his incredible sports career. He is confident, yet even he is surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Despite never having played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be selected by a top USA team. In Atlanta, he is still learning the details of his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be chosen for one of the biggest teams in American sports is remarkable. But Lawrence is used to defying expectations. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but delayed it to focus on discus, after previously playing rugby. Within 20 months, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, aiming for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in a potential NFL career, he confirms, ""American football was in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I had thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then."" Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, did he think he could be chosen? ""Pretty much,"" he says. ""I applied online."" Was he nervous about competing with experienced players? ""No,"" he says. ""I don’t get nervous for many things."" He is not very talkative, but his confidence is clear. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ""I was very pleased to hear that,"" he admits, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is cautious. Without any basic experience, how can he make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have all the attributes needed. It’s about how hard I work,"" he replies. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he’s been selected? ""I am. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I’ll be selected, but I’m not too worried."" This calmness might come from his disappointing Olympic final, where he finished last. He seems to have moved past this and is proud of qualifying for the final with an impressive last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he says. ""The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sport. I can return to it."" After the Olympics, some thought the experience had affected him. Lawrence doesn’t comment. The minimum NFL salary is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on one sport? ""I understand why someone would say that,"" he responds. ""I’m trying to achieve something I dreamed of as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought through."""
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, winter had not yet arrived in Siberia. There was no sign of human life, just an endless view of mountains, streams, and forests. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said in a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow traveling to remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, I will be riding with a friend named Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and said, ""Holodna"" (cold), pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had warm clothes, though I didn't mention that my trip was self-funded and I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at discounted prices. I wasn't sure they would be adequate, especially my large postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students, some taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He read it, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was fulfilling. It was challenging, rarely boring, and offered long holidays for adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: cycling around the world. Since our first ride, Al had been setting greater challenges for himself. This round-the-world bike trip was his greatest so far. At times, he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong those who doubted him. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to participate. An hour before the flight, I signed two forms. The first confirmed I was in good health, and the second required me to empty my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned I needed to stay oriented. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" I was told, and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I was also asked to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was instructed not to touch anything. As we taxied down the runway, my legs were up, trying not to touch the steering pedals, and my hands avoided the switches. My mind was made up: I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right times. Panicking is not an option. This was not comforting as we accelerated down the runway.

Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we immediately banked sharply to the right. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air squeeze out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned sharply left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for the small gap between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even started the acrobatics yet.

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too—it’s that responsive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle. I know many people find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what pilots endure in races. To prove the point, Dario ate sandwiches as soon as we landed. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed of doing loops repeatedly."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you've ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. His ideal temperature, he says, is -18°C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about surviving in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater."" He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ""I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film."" The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ""It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material."" ""My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes."" Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off-limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32°C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ""We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera's locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye's very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She's looking at me but she's not bothered. I've just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can't get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I'd swear it's partly in sheer pleasure,"" he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ""Clearly it's their first view of the world … It's show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats."" Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it firsthand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without receiving supplies along the way. This journey involved swimming through extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers are confident and determined people, and they need to be. This time, however, there is much more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be crucial for scientists. This will provide the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was cared for by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to toughen him up by sending him out into blizzards and icy winds with minimal clothing. His father shared a love of icy adventures with him, and Pen developed exceptional physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman who says he has a ""spine of steel"" and shares his love for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he's at home: ""He's in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he's somewhere in the Arctic."" For fun, she once competed against him in a famous mountain event where riders on horseback race against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour ahead of Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ""It's much harder to be away from them this time,"" he admits. ""They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I told my son, 'You're the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.' He took it seriously, asking his mum how she was all the time, but it became too much for him. It was well-intentioned but unfair."" For similar reasons, Pen plans to have little contact with them while in the Arctic. ""If you call them, you remind them how far away you are."" He is spending his last days before departure preparing his equipment carefully. ""Out on the ice, you can't fix things or do anything that's not straightforward,"" he says. Joining him will be Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will be supported by a team of six, flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for someone like Pen, and he has other concerns too. ""I'm going to be 47 on Thursday. I've done less training than I would like."" Why? ""Organizational tasks always seem more urgent. So I'm almost afraid of what I'm going to ask of myself."" Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the quest for knowledge that inspired past explorers. ""Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,"" he admits, ""and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we're creating a platform to engage as many people as possible in what's happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,"" he says. ""Our skills, which are otherwise unusual and not needed in society, have become very relevant. Suddenly, we're useful again."""
103,"I took a 'year off' and wondered what to do next. Being an Olympian is amazing, and I had opportunities to write, work on TV, and speak at schools and businesses. Despite these activities, I missed having a competitive goal. I wanted to stay fit in case I decided to compete in the Olympics again, so I entered marathons and triathlons. But there was still Ben Fogle's invitation in my mind: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready for intense training. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. I knew if I joined, I would want to win, but I wasn't sure if Ben was the best partner for that. However, the idea of being an underdog was appealing. Ben had already gathered the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the costs, which were high, with the boat and equipment alone costing £70,000. We believed we had a good chance, but it would require effort to secure funding. I also had to consider the loss of income from being away, as speaking at business events is a profitable way for retired athletes to earn money. Participating in the race would give me a new story to share, not just past achievements. Planning this adventure taught me to appreciate the simpler life of a full-time athlete. Olympic preparation was tough, but straightforward, with set training programs and support from doctors and dieticians. I worried about people's reactions to me racing with a TV presenter, fearing it might seem like I just wanted to be on TV. However, my concerns faded during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about mental strength than just rowing. Ben had completed tough challenges like the Marathon des Sables and spent time at sea, but he couldn't row well. I was surprised by his lack of skill, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have expected his level of skill when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty, maybe as a reaction to the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to over 100. Recently, they took over a second property, the 'wilderness farm', which they described as a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They said I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I stare at a page with over 100 husky photos; I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of blooming flowers and leaves. But I think I see the opposite, with winter moving south and rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests of thin conifers, heavy with snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrive at the farm after dark and am immediately given boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes a wall of noise by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth, harnessing the huskies to sleds. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, eager to start. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light. November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a discouraging questioning about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m unsure. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become difficult in sub-zero temperatures. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around by overenthusiastic huskies. But I feel triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe sprinted past the finish line, the press gathered to understand her extraordinary run. Her time was so impressive that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman, to heal injuries from a training accident. Radcliffe says the achievement never really sank in. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but at the time, it felt like just another race. Her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried she might not maintain her pace and could drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, though he admitted that anyone unaware of her fitness might think starting so fast was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers at high speed but still sprinted the last stretch in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run quicker than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't expect anyone to match that time soon, but Radcliffe thought, ‘I'm going to come back and do it next year.’ Unfortunately, that didn't happen. After the race, people wondered how an athlete with such an awkward style beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had spent weeks with Radcliffe, providing daily sessions to help her manage the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle that level of pain. She would push me to go deep into her muscles, and I had to ice my thumbs afterward.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted with, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no time for pleasantries. ‘I'd barely got in the door, and she was ready for a two-hour session. Paula would get every last bit out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I trained really hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people race each other more than themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mindset of never easing up, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me. I never thought, “I can relax now,” it was always: “keep pushing as hard as you can.”’ Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run as fast again. However, she left a lasting legacy, inspiring many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cookery show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and the press would react. At the time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain, and I believed our series contributed something new to it. However, I was concerned whether people would appreciate a cooking approach that included techniques, history, nostalgia, and science. I watched the first episode with mixed feelings of joy and fear, but I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other exciting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection,' each with its own TV show. These journeys were often physical, involving travel and exploration. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet extraordinary artisans, like a man dedicated to creating the best-tasting golden pasta. These people have spent years pursuing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is subjective, and even choosing which dishes to include in the series was challenging. I knew some people would be disappointed if their favorites were left out. However, after much discussion, the TV team and I created a list that offered something for everyone. This confirmed my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, influenced by emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book's title, I never claimed the recipes were 'definitive.' Instead, I used my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I aimed to identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means improving through continuous experimentation. Trying ideas and refining them until they become unique. The TV series allowed me to explore foods, people, and places I hadn't encountered before, which excited me as much as exploring memory and nostalgia in food. Searching for the best ingredients took me worldwide. My adventures included visiting a canning factory processing the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm with low standards, forcing us to stop filming. Refining each recipe, I hand-milked a cow to make ice cream, cooked chicken in a hospital scanner, and nearly set my house on fire trying to make a Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still hours from Marrakech when the van suddenly made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and looked under the bonnet. He stood there for a while, looking at the engine with his hands in his pockets, appearing confident. Eventually, he admitted, ""Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried, ""We can’t stay here forever,"" she said. The field was vast, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. ""No, we can’t stay here forever,"" I agreed, as it was usually best to side with Bea. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away, getting smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass. ""Tell us a story,"" she said. Bea lay next to her. ""Go on, tell us a story."" So I told them about hearing two birds talking the day before we left London. I shared everything the birds discussed: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and their argument over a worm. ""That’s silly, no one understands bird language,"" Bea said. My eyes stung. ""I do."" But my voice wasn’t convincing. ""Liar."" I blushed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ""Mum...?"" But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John returned with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea refused to get out. The boys didn’t mind and waved and smiled at her through the back door windows. We followed John into a tiled café, not far from where our van was parked. ""It’s a hotel,"" John whispered. ""It might be expensive."" ""We’ll just have some tea,"" Mum reassured him, and we sat on the terrace in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ""It’s like syrup in there,"" she said. We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the engine. ""It’s a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum laid blankets on the ground for us to sleep in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ""I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,"" John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John at the wheel. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John carried her into the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we’d get home since our van needed towing. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike her, they were not competing. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, whose name Lucy didn't catch due to the noise. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the pieces they were playing and their travel plans. 

""I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,"" Lucy told them. It sounded impressive, though she didn't really want to go. She often felt this way about the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, causing her to miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group worldwide. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate, and her little brother Gus dreamed of attending the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her repertoire. 

Lucy hadn't applied herself; her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. ""I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,"" her mom had said. Lucy thought it was more about not giving her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing one could do, so she didn't even think about trying to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward, surprised. ""Tanglewood?"" ""Yeah."" ""How old are you?"" ""Fifteen."" He exchanged a glance with the girl, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy hadn't meant to brag. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was showing off. ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying...""

The girl excused herself, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed. ""Have you ever been to Japan?"" He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were rebel music nerds. ""Once, when I was about eight."" He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone."" He took her arm and led her away. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition."" ""They're not the competition."" ""Everyone is the competition.""

Her grandfather took her around the room, introducing her to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, only half-listening. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ""You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" She liked that part—being somebody. Even if it made some people jealous or think she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn't earn her any special respect from her school friends. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘You spend too much time online. You need to experience the real world,’ said Dad. It's hard to argue with him, so I decided to see what experts say about it. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important digital skills. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a key part of modern childhood. Teenagers live in media, unlike adults who just use it for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails. It's not about whether it's good or bad, but how you use it. How does our social networking compare to what our parents did? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it's like the youth clubs parents went to, where they shared jokes and gossip. It helps teenagers develop their identity away from parents and learn to interact with peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says adolescence is about finding out who you are. Social networking helps with self-identity by letting you share your interests and see different perspectives. Research shows active social networkers are less self-centered than those who don't use it. It can also help shy people practice social skills in a less intimidating way. Professor Andrew Phillips studies young people's use of social networks. He believes they help quiet people with specific interests connect with others. If only a few people at your school like a certain music, you might feel isolated. But online, you can find a group of similar people and feel popular in a different way. Pauline White, a digital education expert, says young people who find new interests online and create content are using social networks' full potential. Social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers make videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites are boosting creativity. Photographers can connect, learn, and share images, which helps employability. Businesses use social media to sell and build brand awareness, so understanding it is important. If you have 1000 friends on social networks, they could be customers for a product you create. Linking networks can build a customer base. Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit in their future careers, agrees Matthews. Many sites offer chances to collaborate and share content, which is a key 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age."""
110,"When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long road trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first idea that comes to mind. However, my parents had a different plan for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to organize what many teenagers might consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" my parents kept saying before the trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There must be good reasons why!""

In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" Leaving our comfortable home for a more ""cozy"" space for the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into.

We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under some of the darkest, star-filled skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way!

The next day, we were up at dawn and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains, and the days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that tourist town hinted at what we would experience later. As we climbed to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dodging construction traffic became routine. We laughed as we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument.

We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" managed by park volunteers, were common as traffic stopped to let bears cross. Our own close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its creaky floors and no internet, couldn't dampen our spirits. In exchange, I saw the most amazing views.

After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic place to find something special. It was bittersweet to be home again, but at least I hadn't argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos of our journey to look through. I knew I would remember the unplanned and spontaneous moments the most."
111,"Rose Frost, a sixteen-year-old, was moving to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, was joining him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school under the care of the college Head, as it was important for her to complete her courses without moving. Amy was happy to have the best room at the college, which included a kitchen and study area, along with free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still be keeping an eye on Amy.

Rose was going to her grandmother's house. She had only vague holiday memories of Daisy and had never met her grandfather. Although Rose's parents were not thrilled about the idea, Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was excited to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn't fully understand why her parents had issues with Daisy, but there had been a disagreement in the past, leading to holidays spent elsewhere. Rose's last memory of Daisy was when she was ten, and it was a happy one.

Dahlia mentioned that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved bringing people together. Rose expected to receive dinner invitations, coffee morning requests, and shopping trips soon. Daisy was not a typical frail grandmother; she attended more social events than the Queen of England. Before moving, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was mature and knew about healthy living, but she wanted independence. She wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without always asking for permission. She didn't want to be nagged about homework or staying out late.

Daisy understood Rose's need for independence. Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen mobile phone for emergencies, which made Rose very happy. They agreed to trust each other: Daisy would trust Rose to make mature decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be overbearing. If either went too far, they would discuss it. Rose had always been well-behaved, and her school reports and exam results were excellent. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, but she knew this would be the last time as she was starting her final two years. For Rose, it was a new chapter in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed challenging, unlike other activities teenagers might do, like competing in the Olympics. At 13, she decided to give it a try. Now, the novel she started then is about to be published. When she told her former teacher, the teacher was surprised, thinking Charlotte would write a book in her 30s or 40s. Charlotte couldn't understand why she should wait if she had a chance to succeed now.

On a winter afternoon at her publisher's office, I was surprised to see a 15-year-old girl ready to discuss her book. The novel is impressive, with a confident and action-packed story. Nothing, except the heroine's age, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us, but Charlotte doesn't need any support. She is confident and intelligent, yet grounded.

Charlotte admits she is young and doesn't have many life lessons to share. She says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them."" She believes her age doesn't limit her understanding of the world, but she doesn't claim to be wise. She wanted to explore the theme of taking responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in fiction. She says there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager, and the socially awkward one. She found these stereotypes frustrating. ""What if you're basically fine?"" she asks. She feels that such portrayals can undermine teenagers' self-belief.

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. Their books explore deep psychological themes, and she wondered if she could do the same. However, she found inspiration in a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which advises that if readers can predict the story, the suspense is lost.

Some might think Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get published. Her father's connection in publishing did get her book read initially. She acknowledges her luck, as getting a first novel read is tough at any age. ""Every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show his skills, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump, hit the ramp fast, and flew into the air, arms flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle stuff. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how, and I feared being laughed at. Then my parents decided on a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a huge indoor facility with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students practiced new tricks and landed in foam pits – not a realistic start for the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan assured us. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers just threw themselves down the slopes and hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again. Land in the zone and you keep moving forward, minimizing impact. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain and race towards the jump. My legs would almost go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came down onto the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing was addictive. Some drills copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as happy as I was, and for a moment I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last. On the final run of the day, I kept my speed as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and your nails dig into the harness as the ride stops and then slowly climbs upwards. There's a pause, followed by a sudden drop that makes your stomach feel weightless. You speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park. It's interesting that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are a huge industry. To create the excitement and escape that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's a real challenge. They must balance fun and fear while keeping passengers safe and add new features to keep people coming back. Although people might think rollercoasters have become more intense, many techniques used today were invented by John Miller in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the tracks made by specialist manufacturers. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts explained that it's about quickly switching between different forces so people feel thrilled but safe. Creating a great ride involves telling a story, like a space adventure or jungle chase, and using innovations like the tallest ride or steepest drops. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a theme park development director, agreed that designers need to love thrills to understand what passengers want and to test rides before opening them to the public. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add to the experience, but the physical ride will remain the main attraction for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating pieces for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances occasionally. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. ""Dancing again reminds me of what it's like to be in the studio, taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it's like to rehearse all day,"" she explains. As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching and working with young students. ""A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they are willing to take risks. They want success but don't fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This incomplete picture of their skills means they accept even harsh criticism. They might challenge me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.""

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her work. ""There might be music I'm not fond of, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don't respond well to a certain composer's music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. That doesn't mean starting over with a new piece. Ideally, I'd like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces, which would help lift the mood during tough rehearsals. Unfortunately, I'm always working on big productions where the musical score is already set by the composer and can't be changed.""

Miranda doesn't like to attach herself to one institution. ""I think it's important to keep meeting new people. However, I have to remember that all the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to adapt my work each time I go somewhere new, rather than doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.""

We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ""There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,"" says Miranda. ""This one really tries to show viewers what life is like inside a dance company. There was a scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I recognized it. She knows she's not getting it right but can't make her body do what's needed. It's painful to watch but not staged for the cameras. The public underestimates the work and dedication involved in ballet.""

I'm curious about what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ""It's when everything the company has invested in – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – all come together. Perfection might be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I've been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props is distracting. That's disappointing.""

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ""People want to label you, and I don't understand that. There's also a trend to develop expertise in a narrow area. I don't follow that, though I might one day be known for one thing. For now, I want to broaden my horizons."""
116,"A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there's so much to experience outside? That conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and used old seatbelts to secure myself. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even spending one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to continue. I've been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads, allowing me to stop at roadside cafés and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino, instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I got used to telling people, ""No, I'm not doing it for charity, and I'm not training for a marathon."" When someone at work asks about my weekend, I'd rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website."
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea. At the Greek port, the man seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although still puzzled, he let me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group—not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and enjoyment of completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year."
118,"Text: 'Being a flight attendant isn't easy, but since I started, I've traveled everywhere, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have a lot of free time, and life is never dull, which makes it a great job for someone young like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, away from my family, so I often flew alone when school started and ended. Feeling lonely, I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some let me. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for a new path. At the interview, there were many young people, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say – more than just saying I loved to travel, as everyone else would say that too. Instead, I talked about my strengths and past work experience – and I got the job! I’d recommend this job to anyone because there are many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights aren’t the main reason. Most airline staff work very hard, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again!'"
119,"Text: 'At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel very nervous, but with some encouragement, they agree to try and eventually reach the top. This makes them feel great. We do have children who miss home at the start of the week. Surprisingly, it's not the really young ones who feel this way the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to call now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine after a couple of days, and by the end of their week, they thank us because they have had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. Sometimes, parents call us a lot, asking how their child is doing, which is not really necessary. Often their son or daughter is busy playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back later. We often see a certain type of child coming, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why.'"

However, using an all-British cast was challenging. The UK has stricter rules on how many performances young actors can do weekly compared to the USA, where they can do more shows. Because of this, twice as many actors were needed in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented UK-based actors, and they’ve just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. Although the London theatre is larger than the US venue, it’s been full every night, with everyone eager to hear the songs that first became popular in America. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons each day at the theatre. While the teacher is great, I miss my old school friends.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre offers special ticket deals for schools. They absolutely loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I mentioned I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play along with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I didn’t know. Jamie guided me through it, and I was very pleased when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! While the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they’ve found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show’s on in London for another year and is well worth seeing.'"
