1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just telling people, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you are also letting everyone know you are not at home. This made people more aware that sharing too much online can have negative effects. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering possibilities like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize that the online world can be dangerous and confusing.

This might sound depressing, but don't lose hope. There is a guide to this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the internet and faced many challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the risks of being famous, all before social media existed. These early bloggers have experienced what many of us are going through now. We should learn from their experiences to avoid repeating their mistakes.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was invented at CERN in Switzerland to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall shared everything, and no topic was off-limits. While some saw him as an exhibitionist, others recognized the artistic value of his work.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called ""Dark Night."" He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the problem of sharing too much online remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you expect it to make people like you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that just because the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Text: Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't have all the answers about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch. 

At first, the film seemed harmless, with scientists saying that new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being affected by thoughts. It mentioned a Japanese researcher who claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing, but many scientists are skeptical and say, ""Give me a break."" 

The idea that thoughts can affect water is amazing and could mean new forces are at work in the universe. But we need strong proof that this effect is real, and pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to energy that comes from nowhere, linked to a force driving the universe's expansion. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide.

Recent discoveries show that the universe is stranger than we believed. Astronomers found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" On a more everyday level, neuroscientists found that our perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest links between life on Earth and the universe's design.

Science is far from complete. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some top physicists are working on a Theory of Everything to explain all forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite theories, many people think the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"Text: 'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. These two activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My pattern is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and vice versa. These two types of writing might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. I felt my fictional world expand. Readers seemed to appreciate this side of me as a writer. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can be endless). It’s not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That’s it. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I’ll make it through. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small things – an idea, a word, an image. It’s often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn’t work, you just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t always write masterpieces. This is comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny atoms to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is clear to experts, but its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and its mistakes are either ignored or exaggerated. Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced by new ones, similar to how new music styles are first mocked but later accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. Science is always changing. Scientists often challenge each other's ideas. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Later, physics showed that our observations can affect the universe. Some people think science can't fully explain the universe, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing. At the end of the 19th century, many thought physics was complete, but then came many new discoveries like radioactivity and quantum mechanics. Biology has also made many advances. Some now claim we are close to a complete theory of everything. Science is not just a hobby. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance. We must pay attention to science. Non-scientists need to understand scientific advances because they affect our future and our children's future. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. This is not just a philosophical question; it affects national budgets, health, and even life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing, or even decreased in some cases. This raised new doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement about ebooks might have led to poor investments, with his company losing faith in 'the power of the printed word'. Despite the clear idea that digital and print can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will 'kill' print books. Whether predicting or dismissing this, the idea of books disappearing continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see ebooks and print books as being in conflict, even if evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have shown that the idea of one medium 'killing' another often follows new technologies. Even before digital tech, people predicted the end of existing media. For example, after TV was invented, many thought radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like in cars and factories. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. As early as 1894, people thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, TV, and smartphones, all thought to destroy print books at some point. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the book's death often appears during technological change, reflecting our hopes and fears about such changes. We form emotional bonds with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we connect closely with objects like books, TVs, and computers, sometimes even naming our cars or getting angry at our laptops. So, new technology like e-readers doesn't just mean economic and social change; it also affects our bond with familiar things. As technology advances, we miss what we used to know. This is why industries develop around retro products and old technologies. For example, the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek original manuscripts. The move from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for silent films. The same happened with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have made people appreciate the physical quality of 'old' books, even their smell. This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. Yet, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power and our resistance to change. We use familiar stories, like tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the book's death reflects our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves."
6,"Text: 'For nearly a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30 every weekday, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years managed their daily routines. I wanted to see how they found time to be creative and productive. By looking at the simple details of their daily lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to show a new side of their personalities and careers. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.’ I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.’ This book is about the conditions for creativity, not the final product. It’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something about your inner self. My book explores questions I face in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to focus entirely on a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is short, do you give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions, but I provide examples of how successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas come from small daily efforts and how work habits affect the work itself. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it’s really about routines. A routine might seem ordinary, but it can help you use your limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine can guide your mental energy and help you avoid being controlled by your moods. Psychologist William James thought that having good habits could free your mind for more interesting things. Ironically, James himself was a procrastinator and couldn’t stick to a schedule. This book started from my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was at work trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a ‘morning person’ and can focus well in the morning but not after lunch. To feel better, I searched online for other writers’ schedules. I found them interesting and thought someone should collect these stories. That’s how I started the Daily Routines blog and later, this book. The blog was simple; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the variety of voices. I let my subjects speak through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t be possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can guide further reading.'"
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. There, on a rainy August day, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From that moment, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of his university studies, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was interested in the earliest times, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied ancient, delicate creatures found in grey rocks. 

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job, especially in the type of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving something doesn't always mean getting it. When a job as an Assistant Lecturer at Tavistock College in London was advertised, he applied, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't attend because of an accident. The replacement professor disliked the absent professor and made sure Howard got the job. Howard was surprised by the unexpected support but later learned the real reason. He was a little disappointed but was mainly happy to have the job he wanted.

Howard often thought about how his professional life was orderly, with clear plans and actions, unlike the chaos of personal life. He realized how strangers could change your life, like when his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he returned to the college, postponed his lecture, and reported the theft. While having coffee, he met a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils that needed study, which would be his biggest challenge and secure his career. If not for the theft, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding funds to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they look like maggots, they have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Through his research on how our senses combine to create our perception of flavor, Spence is quietly influencing what we eat and drink. This includes the products of large food companies (he advises one well-known multinational and receives funding from another) and the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink, a field informally known as gastrophysics. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, and even background noise can affect taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers many interesting insights for anyone who enjoys eating. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and low-tech. There are soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less serious in universities. But now, since the government wants universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research is valued. Spence is helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar, often due to government rules. Companies do this gradually so customers don't notice the change. ""Research shows that if you tell people about the change, they focus on the taste and don't like it as much,"" he says. Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a major food producer. ""At the time, people thought science and food didn't mix, but most food is scientific. Who better to change that view than Heston?"" Their collaboration led to the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish at Blumenthal's restaurant. Interestingly, Spence notes that the Italian futurists were experimenting with sound and food a century ago, but it didn't become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. For example, his research shows that high-pitched music enhances sweetness, while low-pitched sounds make food taste bitter. ""It's surprising when shapes affect taste, or when music changes how you perceive flavor,"" he says. An airline will soon match music with food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says happens often. One wonders what dinner parties are like at Spence's home. Once, they ate rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. ""We've had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and 10 different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" For Spence, home, shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false facts, chatter, and rumours, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in shops. Now, we do most things ourselves. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows. Smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly switching tasks and worrying about dropping one. Multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones, which can cause mental fog. Multitasking also creates a craving for new things, distracting us. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to focus, is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former professor of psychology, calls it info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an email is unread can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This loss is greater than the loss from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is better organized. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is hard on our brains. Small decisions use the same brain resources as big ones, leading to poor decisions. In discussions with business leaders and scientists, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not the email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other work done."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions would have been seen as irrelevant. Animals had behaviors, these behaviors produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. The idea that animals have consciousness, feelings, and moral systems was considered sentimental. But recently, this has started to change. Research into the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate: can animals be said to have consciousness? This debate leads to another one: not about consciousness, but conscience – a sense of right and wrong that guides behavior. In a recent experiment with cows that had to open a locked gate to get food, those that opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure – by jumping and kicking their legs – than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for beef production and consumption? The observations may not be disputed, but their interpretation is. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the only logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the verge of a major ethical revolution. Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, believes we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. He thinks animals have a simpler theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail believes we should stop anthropomorphizing. The three may never agree because the issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Given that defining consciousness is difficult, can we ever know, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks, what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an experiment that seems to show starlings – a type of bird – can get depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. Half were in luxurious cages, with plenty of space and water. The other half were in small, barren cages. Initially, both groups were fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and soon learned to take only from the tasty box. But when offered only unpleasant worms, only the birds in luxurious cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. ‘We look back with horror on an era of racism,’ he says. ‘Our view about animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.’ If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his view. Manning has written a textbook, ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" ‘What we are seeing is a pendulum swing,’ he says. ‘At the turn of the 20th century, some assumed animals thought like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are going the other way. But it is a contentious subject, and you want to avoid the sound of academics with personal grievances and strong opinions.’"
11,"Simplified Text: 

Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that argument can help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve complex problems, making it harder to think deeply. West notes that we are exposed to a lot of poor thinking and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. More data does not always mean better knowledge or decisions. 

According to the National Endowment for the Arts, reading literature has decreased by 10%, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media has a cost. She suggests that less reading might lead to less critical thinking because people focus more on real-time media and multitasking. However, there is no clear answer yet on how technology affects critical thinking. 

Technology has changed how we think, says Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology. She explains that reading helps develop imagination, reflection, and critical thinking, unlike visual media like video games and TV. Visual media can improve some information processing, but they often do not allow time for reflection or analysis. As a result, many people, especially younger ones, may not reach their full potential.

How society views technology affects how it sees critical thinking. This is clear in the debate about video games and thinking skills. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says that video games are not just entertainment; they can be good learning tools. Evidence shows that games like Sim City and Civilization help build reasoning skills and teach decision-making in realistic virtual environments. These games allow players to explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise. In the digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who used to work in an office. He became unhappy with office life and decided to write about the benefits of manual work. His latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea when he noticed ads on a credit card machine while shopping. Crawford believes these ads are hard to avoid and distract us from our own thoughts. This makes it difficult to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people are less likely to talk to strangers. Crawford says we often experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can control our desires. Many people are worried about this, like office workers who complain about emails but still check them in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford thinks technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves. This affects society because we prefer texting to talking. By only interacting with digital versions of people, we might lose important social skills. Crawford gives an example from his gym, where people used to share music but now listen to their own with ear buds. This change has made the gym less social. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public. More importantly, he believes in engaging with the world through skilled activities. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who work with real things. These activities require good judgment and interaction with others. Crawford says that when we engage with the world this way, digital experiences seem less important. He doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but that we should find ways to use our judgment. This can help us focus better and resist distractions."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, we answer this question in a few words. But when you are a philosopher, like me, it is a bit harder. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. People might think you claim to have special knowledge or wisdom. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. So, why do people have this idea about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) said that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, was the best life. Few modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked with thinking deeply. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just accepting what society says is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make decisions. But living an examined life does not mean reading many philosophical books or spending all your time thinking. It means looking closely at everyday experiences to see if they are important. It does not mean living like a wise person away from society. The examined life is practical and involves sharing knowledge, which is important for a good life. Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from real life, especially for those without formal training. This is partly because of how universities work, with funding and evaluations tied to expensive journals. Philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. To outsiders, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. If philosophers once tried to change this view, many have stopped. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy focus on specific, technical debates, explaining them to non-experts is very hard. Philosophy, in some cases, has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about evaluating human actions. But I feel this title is not enough because ethics is often linked to rules and laws. Recently, ethics has come to mean applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often discuss them. However, philosophy is more than this. A discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is wrong (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people examine the actions and beliefs that shape their lives. Sometimes we find what we already know; other times, we see our beliefs are hard to justify. By examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, philosophers have often used food to talk about other ideas. When they mentioned eating, it was usually a metaphor for something else, like learning. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related topics. An interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He talked about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is now linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants and food shops, likely because businesses think it will attract customers. Food is social and cultural. It comes from history and is shared with others in our communities. These communities give us people to eat with and the systems to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than any other product, making it a good topic for philosophical study. Once food is made, critics start discussing it. But why do they have such a special role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill, but that famous food critics are just better at describing tastes. This area has been overlooked because philosophers have mostly studied vision, not taste. Another part of food is its beauty. We say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. But food is eaten and disappears, unlike art, which lasts over time. So, some think food cannot be considered truly beautiful. There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-GMO foods? Our choices often show our ethical beliefs. Philosophers ask why we make these choices, and discussing this is important. Another topic is how cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. Home cooks have a duty to their guests because of personal relationships. At home, everyone shares food and friendship. Professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are not open to everyone, only to qualified people. Their relationships are professional, not personal. A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways. First, we can appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food. Second, we build personal connections with people from other cultures by eating together, a practice with a long history in diplomacy. The essay includes many examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy interesting for readers.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, designs 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were not exciting or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a storyline or if decisions made in one game could affect the next. He changed a classic board game called Risk to create a new version: Risk Legacy. In this version, decisions made during the game have a lasting impact. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and past actions become part of the game. Daviau said: 'You could point to the board and say: ""Right here! You did this!""'

Daviau was then asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players try to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very successful, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was not based on an earlier game. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players explore and conquer a new world. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said: 'It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.'

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a small interest. 'When I was working on it, I thought: ""This is different and good,""' he said. 'But it's strange and breaks many rules. I thought only a few people would like it.' However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He sees it as a big step forward in game design. 'It's a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,' he said. 'There's nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and you get that with legacy games.'

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the adventure was more important than worries about the game's lifespan. 'At first, I was worried about changing and ruining the board,' he said. 'But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don't watch the same movie twice, do they? You're buying an experience. It's like the stories you get from video games.' The legacy format is influenced by video games and the demand for episodic entertainment from TV series. Daviau once wanted to be a TV writer but moved to advertising and then game design. The love of storytelling stayed with him. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. 'You need to know how it ends and starts,' he said. 'But you also need more than just an outline.'

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is interested in seeing how others use the idea. But he also thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, believes the legacy format is a big change. 'It's the kind of idea that changes how you think about board games,' he said."
16,"Text: 'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared widely online and seemed like something from a children's movie. People enjoy stories like this because they like to imagine animals are like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very intelligent but look very different from us. Octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways. 

Some people think that giving animals human traits is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, believes the opposite. He says that not recognizing human-like traits in animals, which he calls anthropodenial, is more common. He has studied animal behavior for many years and found that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. 

In the past, people thought animals were smart. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the nineteenth century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said that the difference between humans and animals is one of degree, not kind. 

In the twentieth century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines that responded to stimuli or as robots with instincts. People who thought animals had inner lives were considered unscientific. This view coincided with humans destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare. 

Dr. de Waal believes we are now starting to see animal intelligence as similar to human intelligence, though not the same. He says that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the species' unique traits. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts. 

In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might think we are not very smart because we can't change our skin color. 

Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean, but he knows that viral stories can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers got upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video of the experiment convinced more people. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways.'"
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the industrial revolution. Robots have been used in car and manufacturing industries for years, but experts say we are close to a big change where robots will be used in many more areas. Many people think robots will take over most jobs in the next 50 years, but they also believe their own jobs will still exist. This is not true: robotic automation will affect every industry soon. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that takes two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a startup called Simbe Robotics has made Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check if goods are stocked and priced correctly. Supporters of robotic automation say robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers. Critics warn that we should not ignore the importance of human skills at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will have laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but there will be a lack of skilled workers. Zhang says that people with lower skills will be affected and should retrain themselves, as they cannot rely on the government to protect their jobs. New technologies will create a new type of robots for consumers, like robots that live with us at home. This is a big chance for companies, but it also brings challenges, like the need for new safety and privacy rules. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered the question of why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" This response reflects a common curiosity: why do people risk their lives for something that seems pointless? Mallory's answer might inspire some to follow their dreams, challenging them to face the unknown. The real value of his answer is its simplicity, suggesting that climbing might be just for adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He believed that the style of climbing, like using more or less equipment, should match the rules of the specific climbing game. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in Western climbing discussions, from magazines to debates.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also be very limiting, like being stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. But some argue that the simplicity of climbing, with its limited choices, is a form of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective. He suggests asking, ""Why do people climb?"" to explore why humans are drawn to climbing. Fitschen believes climbing is in our genes; it’s natural for us to take on challenges and test our limits, even with risks. So, the joy of climbing is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor adds another view. He thinks climbing helps develop virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing can help people develop qualities that are useful in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who rely only on themselves, without help from others or technology, must be fully committed to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson argued that independent climbs deserve more recognition because they are harder and riskier. However, this view has been controversial, as it might encourage unnecessary risks.

Finally, climbing can be seen from a non-Western perspective. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone"" during a climb. The physical effort, meditation, and intuitive problem-solving are key parts of climbing. Some say these aspects are similar to Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This offers another reason why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"Alfred Brendel, a famous pianist, became a leading figure in classical music over sixty years. He was known for being intellectual and serious, focusing on European piano music. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he rarely taught. People close to him saw a playful side, but it was not often seen in his concerts. His life was a cycle of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert, asking for lessons. At first, Brendel was not interested, as he had few students before. He compared it to hiring a mountain guide to teach a child to walk. However, something about Kit, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Kit played the piano very well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital where he played beautifully. Brendel thought, ""I have to make time for him."" Kit's performance was rare, showing a deep understanding and subtlety.

As Brendel steps back from public life, Kit is starting to become known, but Brendel is careful to prevent him from burning out. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, with his mother always nearby. He also composes music. Brendel believes composing helps Kit read music better. Kit has an amazing memory and can read music at first sight. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and understands Brendel's advice, applying it throughout a piece.

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations for Kit. He dislikes when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, as it can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit plays some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

Now 80 years old, Brendel reflects on his career. He never rushed to be famous but aimed to achieve certain things by age 50. By then, he had accomplished most of his goals but continued to explore more. Although he no longer performs, he enjoys his new phase of life, with many musical ideas still in his mind."
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden was not in a dirty city. It was by a river and gently sloped down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places of escape, peace, and solitude. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a greenhouse, unlike some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass was broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He wasn’t without humor, though. Silly things amused him, and he liked using certain phrases, like ‘It’s immaterial to me’. He probably wished he had achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn’t passionate about. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was very skilled at home repairs, like building bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved changing furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I did like the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mother later why I wasn’t given the chance, she said, ‘You’d never have practiced’.

Of the three options, moors, woods, or river, I usually chose the river. I could escape into another world there. With a fishing net and old sandals, I’d walk along the riverbank, looking for a spot to take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic. I’d wade into the water, looking for fish to catch with my net. After failing to keep them alive at home, I’d return them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father said, ‘There’s an apprentice gardener job in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, Dad went against his usual thinking. He might have preferred me to be a carpenter, but I like to think he believed things might work out if I stuck with it. Maybe I’m fooling myself, but I prefer to believe that deep down, even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw my passion for it."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I do the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us over the cliff and into the ocean 120 meters below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes up to him, and MacEwen gently strokes him. Despite the howling wind, MacEwen looks completely at home on his island. He is showing me around. Pointing to the north, he shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds pouring rain on Rum’s large mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep as rain approaches. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep interrupts our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to gather the sheep but isn’t doing well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen calls, meaning the dog should go to the right. Tie doesn’t listen and goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, sounding disappointed. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, takes care of the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They leave the house and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But living on the island has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I get used to it, along with having no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck seems wonderfully unexpected. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians, who get off with their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their boots to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay in a newspaper and bought it without visiting. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know anything about farming? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it tastes amazing. Also amazing: my ferry ride the next morning to another island. In the past two months, many ferries had been canceled because of high seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, phone or no phone, was what I secretly hoped for."
22,"Text: 'The game design industry was once mainly for computer scientists and self-taught people, with few ways to enter. It was often seen as just a hobby for young fans, but now the video games industry is taken seriously. Industry experts are not surprised. Making video games is not easy. Games based on new movies need many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it is hard to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says: ‘It’s hard to make progress in big companies or influence major games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just directors who lead a whole game, but also people who design systems and parts of games.’ So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer a degree in computer science, but Jim disagrees. ‘The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t created something. Game design is more a way of life than a job. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real.’ Another expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s value in “just doing it”, but it’s more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs; even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense to contribute to this changing field.’ Can you do it alone? ‘Maybe, but it’s hard,’ says John. ‘A good postgraduate course in games can help and offer support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and move up. They are interested in all entertainment media and have a strong interest in arts and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but decided games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and know about the growing variety of the field. Connections can also help. To succeed in games, as in many areas, you need to network.’ The old idea of a teenage boy playing games all day is gone. Now, games are seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. ‘Games are becoming popular with larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this big area as full of possibilities and opportunities.’"
23,"Since I was a child, all I ever wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend who came to the park with us, and his dad was very pushy. He always said, ""You can't do this, you can't do that."" My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and hasn't been involved in football since. I'm glad it didn't happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It's only by practicing that you can score spectacular goals. The best players in the world, who have amazing natural talent, wouldn't have achieved what they have without years of practice. Sometimes you see young players crashing into each other, but I was taught technique. If I'm teaching kids, the most important thing I try to teach is to enjoy learning skills. I used to do every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now it's important to get a good education, but football was the only thing on my mind then. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We're already trying to read him books even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope the fact that he usually wants to kick them around doesn't mean he takes after me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so some of us younger players could play for the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He never said, ""This is your big chance to prove yourselves,"" but we all knew we had to. Although I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, ""You can't win anything with kids."" That made us aware of how much we had to do. You always have some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite what he said. I rely on close friends and family a lot. But having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people sometimes say to me, ""I can't believe you let your mother keep working."" Of course, I've helped my parents financially. I paid off the loan on their house and bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong individuals, and I think they would be offended at the idea that they should be on the payroll. My mum doesn't earn a lot as a hairdresser, but she loves what she does. On the other hand, it gives me pleasure to use my money to make things easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people say, but that doesn't give me all the answers. After I stop playing, I think I'll take a year off or maybe even longer, doing things I haven't been able to do all these years. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg on the ski slopes and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured."
24,"Text: 'We were living at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He was desperate to find us a cheap place to live because my father couldn’t write anything sellable in Los Angeles. This was bad for Sam, as he could lose clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point was not popular with day-trippers. The road was not nice, and the charming resort of La Carmella was nearby. People with some money stayed there. Only if you were broke or loved surfing did you go the extra mile to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, the place was full of people. After months of being almost alone, we were surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to write a script on time and was in a bad mood. He didn’t notice that I spent most days on the beach with a book and Rusty, my dog. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I felt sorry for him and gave him water. My father half-heartedly threw a boot at him, but Rusty didn’t care and stayed closer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you think he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us.’ My father replied, ‘You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes, he brought things he didn’t dig up, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel. I had to return these to their owners. He also liked to swim and always came with me, even though I swam faster and farther. You’d think he’d get discouraged, but he never did. We had been swimming that day. My father, having finished his script, drove to Los Angeles to deliver it. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together in and out of the sea. As the sun set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. They chose a wave and stood, perfectly balanced, riding it until it reached the sand. One surfer caught my eye. She had a style that made the others look clumsy. She decided to stop and rode in on a final wave. ‘Hi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’ ‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’ ‘You could get one.’ ‘No money.’ ‘You’re British, aren’t you? Are you visiting?’ ‘No, I live here.’ ‘Is your father American?’ ‘No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he wrote.’ ‘No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’ ‘Rufus Marsh.’ ‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that cover to cover.’ She looked at me with new interest, and I thought this was how it always was. They were friendly but never interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning.'"
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long queue at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie, who often traveled, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this time the advice was wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers said there was a 'breakdown in the computer system,' which made the passengers frustrated. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service. Violet felt like leaving but realized she had lost her phone, which was more annoying than the long wait. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left it there because all her contacts were saved on the phone. Her son Harry always warned her about this. She borrowed a phone from a couple in the queue to call Harry and left a message asking him to contact her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at home. If it wasn't, she would have trouble finding numbers she needed in New York. Part of her was relieved, but she didn't tell Harry. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding but forgetful. Finally, the queue moved, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were fake walnut panels, shiny chandeliers, and airport-style carpets. She took the elevator, crowded with tired passengers, to the twelfth floor. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she requested. She had paid extra to ensure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"Text: When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he didn't know he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing interesting images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent morning, Maloof stood among all these items and looked around. He knows he’s discovered something special, and it happened by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ For some time now, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together the details of Maier’s life. They contacted local families that employed her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit eccentric, always had a camera with her. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although she was not very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed to be very dedicated to her ‘second job’, documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was done for money. Her images often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or did she borrow ideas from those who came before her?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. The funny thing is he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I progressed as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"Text: 'When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when the book was very popular, but she was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have happened, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past gave more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I ask how it feels to be successful at a young age, she answers modestly. ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels part of the success. There’s a family feeling at home, and I got a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.’ Then she adds, ‘What is annoying is when people think I’m not trying to do something philosophical in the book.’ ‘I had the idea to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part is half the length of the one before,’ said Catton. The book speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters if the reader notices this. ‘I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them.’ Despite the experimental structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she says she didn’t plan the story beforehand. ‘I would write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be to get out of it.’ It’s clear she also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We also talk about her love of TV drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue, I ask if she might be interested in screenwriting. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says. Her conversation is full of enthusiasm, with a low, secretive laugh. She becomes animated when talking about her work and New Zealand. ‘I notice when I come to Britain how my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move from New Zealand to busy areas, to be around many people.’ But for now, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I hope it gives her the inspiration for many more novels.'"
28,"Text: 'As a boy, Jonny Kinkead loved using tools in his dad’s garage and playing the guitar. These two hobbies became his job for the past forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still amazed by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? And by using different types of wood, you get different sounds. It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a holiday job and save up for one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and woods affected the sound, and how to put them together.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been doing similar things with other items. ‘We drew model boats and planes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use saws and sharpen chisels. I’d also been fixing instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he didn’t think of a career in guitar-making yet. ‘I was also into painting and sculpture,’ he says. After school, he chose to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he remembers. But halfway through, he dropped out. ‘I was too individualistic,’ he says. ‘But I left with a clearer idea of what I wanted to do. I was still into sculpture, but I realized guitar-building is like sculpture – it’s about shaping sound. And I thought it might be more practical than pure art because you’re making things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only covered the cost of materials, but as he became known as a top guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he’s ‘still just getting by’. He admits he can’t make more than ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. In the early years, he worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals most weekends to get musicians to try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments – when musicians asked, he didn’t have an answer because it didn’t come naturally to him. Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the only good acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as real, even though we’ve always had good instrument-making courses and the skills have stayed the same. But now our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says valuable techniques can be learned in the classroom, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take courses. However, he also believes there’s no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see where people have succeeded or failed, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you’re taught by someone else, you only learn one way, but if you’re self-taught, like I was, you learn everything.’'"
29,"Text: 'When talking about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a tradition, and like many others, I will mention the famous comment by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist, who said, ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This is still true today. Many people try to explain why English people talk so much about the weather, but they often fail. They think that English people talk about the weather because they are very interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not exciting, so he finds the obsession with it hard to understand. He notes that England does not have extreme weather like tornadoes or blizzards. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you can never be sure what the weather will be like. My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the point. Our weather conversations are not really about the weather. Instead, they are a way for English people to start talking to each other. Phrases like ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ or ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ are not about the weather; they are greetings or ways to start a conversation. This is similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially. There are specific times when English people use weather-talk. It can be a greeting, a way to start a conversation, or a topic to fill a silence. This happens often, so people think English people only talk about the weather. An English conversation might start with weather-talk, use it to break the ice, and return to it if there is a pause. This is why people from other countries, and even some English people, think we are obsessed with the weather.'"
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were already interested because they chose this trip over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not satisfying. When she couldn't find a suitable historical novel to add context and interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching after 31 years, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. Although she had a successful teaching career, Alice felt she was taking a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and very physically demanding. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not as exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my fiction.’ Alice says her main goal for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s children’s fiction. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction today deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she quickly adds, ‘but much of it is dark reality; or there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’ Alice always tried to teach English and History as related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is motivated by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when a child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because then the challenge is on. It’s up to me to make it work at that point.’ She sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the idea also came from the ‘empty nest’ as her two sons were leaving home, and a suggestion from her head teacher that she would enjoy a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course I didn’t think was necessary.’ Before she was accepted on the course, she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, a requirement she learned about only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analyzed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews, and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off to write her first novel. It helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his help in editing the novel was key. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep on adding another scene. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,"Text: To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to take part in a special race. The race would be between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same point. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and it’s very cold right now, so I’ll be warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. Unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, Alistair was dressed in full winter cycling gear. He was confident despite the cold. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’

The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 metres up. This was no problem for the car, but Alistair’s first couple of miles had a 25 per cent incline, so he had a tough start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across the countryside to Fleet Moss. Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s early confidence was quickly challenged. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first obstacle. A giant tractor came out of a field and onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all because of this farmer!’ After tense moments, the tractor was gone, and Jonny was back on track, driving into the morning mist.

Meanwhile, Alistair was struggling with the slope. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out, he had a chance to show his skills. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair picked up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another local challenge. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have been there since before cars were invented, and the roads are not made for speed. Jonny tried to get through a very narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream on the road. Once clear of the last village, the car was on a straight path to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was.

As Jonny sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ He raised his arms in victory. Minutes later, the car pulled up and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said, disappointed. ‘I’m gutted.’"
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all make you feel separate from the outside world. The quiet helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hard to focus only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused that I forget there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my lifelong coach, taught me early on that this was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The 2006 defeat wasn’t so hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer beat me easily, more easily than if I’d believed in myself more. But losing in 2007 left me very upset. I knew I could have done better, and it wasn’t my ability that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and waste it. Toni, a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me; he criticizes me even when I win. But I was so upset that he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might have been my last chance. I know a professional athlete’s career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more, and I let a big one pass in 2007. Toni couldn’t ease my grief, but he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I’d learned from that defeat; that my mindset would not fail me this time. The best sign was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family and friends the night before the final, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t forbid them from mentioning it, but they knew I was already playing the match in my mind. Until the start of play, that space was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: 'A young, idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa in April 1957 and soon wrote home, saying, ‘I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood.’ She spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. Her name was Jane Goodall. In 1963, Britain’s National Geographical Society made Jane Goodall famous with articles and TV documentaries about her chimpanzee research. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children’s books and the 1971 bestseller In the Shadow of Man, translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. Ironically, her fame might have overshadowed her real achievements. Many articles, interviews, and books tell her life story, but they often focus on her adventurous spirit or her role as a feminist, rather than her scientific work. These images can undervalue her true contributions. Based on the number of references to her research, the success of her students, and the data from her forty-year study, Jane Goodall should be seen as a leading pioneer in her field and the world’s top zoologist. Her main achievement is simple: she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before Goodall, we didn’t know chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We didn’t realize they shared emotions with humans or had social systems like ours. We wouldn’t have believed that chimpanzee communities had different cultural traditions. Her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), is the most important work in this area, like an encyclopedia for chimpanzee research. Her long-term study in Gombe, Nigeria, is called ‘one of the Western world’s great scientific achievements’ by biologist Stephen Jay Gould. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives. Even as a child, there were signs of who Jane Goodall would become. The clearest sign was in 1939, when she was five. One autumn day, Jane disappeared. The police, neighbors, and family searched for her. After a frantic search, she reappeared with straw in her hair and clothes. Her mother asked where she had been. Jane said she wanted to know how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours to find out. This could be seen as the start of her career as a biologist.'"
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford speaks to me in the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to viewers of children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.’ Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Lots of actors, some very famous, think they can do funny voices and, actually, many of them probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it than that. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a standard acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a major part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky enough to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and many forms, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes everything from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound enthusiastic about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and cheery. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a huge difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that help voiceover artists put them together.’ She claims to have reached the top of her profession through persistence as much as natural ability. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or simply practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone considering a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"Text: 'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a dream job for many kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more realistic jobs, like becoming a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, after a typical cartoonist’s childhood (loving comic strips, contributing to school publications, being known as ‘the kid who draws’), I studied graphic design in college. After graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was earning enough to support myself. You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical barriers are low, but it’s still a tough job. No one should try to become a cartoonist unless they feel they can’t do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and leaves time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t turn down work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about everything. But what about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are mostly gone. Today, cartooning is more like running a business – you have to create and sell your work. The more comfortable you are with this, the better you’ll do. I’ve seen cartoonists with average talent and great business skills do better than artistic geniuses. It surprises me how many people are afraid someone will steal their ideas, even if they’ve never sold a cartoon. Some are so worried they won’t let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, just draw a ‘c’ for ‘copyright’, put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it’s more likely no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it’s not a disaster – it could be a lucky break!'"
36,"Text: Twenty years ago, I was moving house and clearing out old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually hate getting rid of things, so why did I want to throw it away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to leave it there when a young man came up to me, looking confused. He asked, ""You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?"" I said I was, already feeling a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways. In the years that followed, I often felt sorry for what I’d done. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. That’s how I felt when I read the email from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He said, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back. He used my name to find me online and contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He offered to sell it back to me at a fair price. I almost cried with happiness. I had forgotten my dad’s habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s when it was popular. I loved its calming sound, but I couldn’t make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn’t need to play well to be a rock star. When I got my old guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Picking it up again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I felt the need to stand up and play it with a strap over my shoulder. My fingers remembered where to go, even though I couldn’t draw a diagram of the chords. My fingertips felt the pain of holding down the strings. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument, so I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are others like me who want to play again. We could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!"
37,"Text: 'Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about sleep. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was the only one talking about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Insomniacs, who I interviewed many of, know that sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social health. It’s good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? I haven’t heard much about them in these discussions. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM or ‘Rapid Eye Movement’ sleep, the stage with the most dreams. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years dreaming. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests dreams are important. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who thought that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. But it wasn’t that simple. Later research didn’t support this idea, and the study of dreams shifted to their physical origins. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams matter. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams better than others. He concluded that using dreams increases with interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with dreams, as films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don’t all people – like teachers, software designers, and politicians – need to think creatively? Dreams, according to Stickgold, help us connect ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new patterns. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ‘ignore the obvious and put together things that make a kind of unexpected sense ... This is what creativity is,’ says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come so quickly that my fingers can hardly keep up. I don’t know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn’t just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream.'"
38,"Text: 'Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. In her studio, which has a beautiful sea view, you see empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a pioneer in the copyist art movement, able to recreate the richness of early-20th century impressionist paintings and 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Surprisingly, she doesn't keep any of her own work. 'As soon as I finish them, they go,' she says. Susie is in high demand. Over her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts sometimes think they are originals. While the originals are worth millions, her reproductions sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie doesn't usually reveal her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but status is also important. One celebrity likes to show off his 'Van Gogh' painting, which is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. 'Many famous people pretend my copies are originals,' she says. 'That's their choice.' Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank and displaying Susie's copy. Susie is honest about her work. She makes her reproductions look as real as possible, believing that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as an original is illegal, and although she knows people who have done it, she has never been tempted. People who make fakes often get into trouble. Susie isn't rich and has had hard times, but her situation is better now, and she doesn't want to risk her reputation. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. It was good training for her current work and gave her a love for plants, but it was hard to live on. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets but is glad she found something more financially rewarding. When young artists ask Susie for advice, she tells them to learn to draw accurately. She also says she has studied a lot to do what she does. Her skills allow her to do anything from drawing plants to copying 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art. She now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie says people often think modern art is easy, like child's play. But impressionists painted quickly and freely, yet were also very careful. This combination is hard to master. Given her talent, it's surprising Susie doesn't create her own art. Isn't art about self-expression? And could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She says her work is the result of years of training, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked like photos – okay, but not special. Susie is a perfectionist.'"
39,"During her racing days, nothing was more important to Ellen MacArthur than the sea, except maybe being the fastest on it. She was obsessed with sailing since she was a child. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a non-stop, solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat Kingfisher. It was her home and workplace for 94 days. She explained how carefully she planned everything, even counting the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she needed. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly showed her stock of freeze-dried food, the small gas stove, and the neatly organized medical supplies. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her think about how humans take what they want and move on. When I visited Ellen’s office, she had just finished a conference call. She explained why we must act now to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways not to use them up."" Initially, her message was to use less, but she realized there was another way to see things. Now she focuses on re-using, like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the past three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says, ""but I love learning. The current situation is something I can't ignore. Sailing seemed selfish in comparison. This is different. It’s about finding how my voice can be most useful. It really matters.""

She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It is part of who I am. You are connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on the record, on practical things, on survival. My new message is not as simple as saying: 'I’m going to be the fastest person around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this is more important than anything I’ve ever done."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous among teenagers. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to inspire them to go outside and try new challenges. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they turn thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

I talked to some experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agreed that a young climber might be physically strong enough, but they were unsure if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also doubted that a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that – there's still a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we trust our experience as climbers. Watching Jordan grow stronger gives me confidence.'

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it just his father's ambition? Paul says, 'This isn't about me wanting fame through my son. At first, Jordan thought about doing this later, but we decided, why not now? We regularly check with him to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting challenge. The more exciting the record, the more interest it gets. This creates a problem for Jordan. People might say that achieving records is more important than enjoying the adventure, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to engage with the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something impressive, like climbing Everest. Paul says, 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we'll end this project and go to the gym.'"
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they’re not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won’t know who he is. I’ve just started a music degree, but even my classmates don’t know much about classical music. If you don’t know the composers, you probably don’t own their music. The statistics are not encouraging for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find that hard to believe. So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I’m a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not a big classical music fan. I like many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure. Why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Experts say we can’t focus for more than about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more interesting to us than long classical pieces without lyrics. Classical music is powerful, but it doesn’t deal with issues that matter to teenagers. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says classical concert audiences have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don’t know why people like classical concerts more as they get older, but I know that if your parents love something, you might avoid it. Some say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are eager to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They like classical music when they perform, but it’s not their first choice for listening. Playing and listening to music have become separate activities. When we want to relax, we choose pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to herself. Her mother, who was getting out of the car too, didn’t hear her, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be thrown out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and went towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. Lively, probably, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,"" she thought. The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, to her delight. Focused on putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m serious because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, a breeze brushing her cheek. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he’d jump well."
43,"Cody Simpson is a 15-year-old Australian who has become famous for his music. He started playing the guitar at six and writing songs at seven. However, he was also very interested in swimming and surfing. When he was 13, he posted some videos online of himself singing at a school concert. These videos became very popular, and people wanted to see more. Cody recorded more videos at home and shared them online, receiving a lot of positive feedback.

Cody was also a talented swimmer, training with top coaches. But when record labels showed interest in him, he had to make a difficult decision: continue swimming in Australia or move to the US to pursue a music career. At a young age, Cody chose to take the risk and move with his family to the US. This decision surprised many people because Cody was known as a quiet and modest person.

His family supports him but stays out of the spotlight. Cody believes it's important to have supportive people around to stay grounded. He sometimes worries about how his decision affects his younger brother and sister, especially since his brother has to travel and do school on the road. However, his family reassures him of their support.

Cody's success came quickly and unexpectedly. He now travels to countries he never thought he would visit and performs for large audiences. He knows this success might not last forever, but he is grateful for the opportunities he has had."
44,"Text: I jumped out of bed, lifted a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sunlight. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the wall of sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I worked with most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing I could do it. Not that my grandfather noticed much. With one hand still on the curtain, I looked along the half-mile of steaming black water from the wood processing factory in Milltown. With fragile ice on both sides, the dark open patch was followed by solid ice downstream. As I took off my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. A boy I didn’t know. I frowned. Unbelievably, he was trying to balance on an ice shelf along the water warmed by the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and reached for my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there – a silver chain my famous grandfather once brought back from South America. Better than having a famous grandfather is having this chain, which only he, my mom, and I know about. Plus, I have the diary he kept on that journey. I keep it under my pillow and read bits of it before I sleep. I patted the chain again and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled at me as I grabbed a banana from the counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway, almost bumping into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ‘Can’t you watch where you’re going?’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going, anyway?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ As if my wetsuit didn’t make that obvious. As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s getting harder. ‘What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. For a moment, his words hurt like he wanted them to. But I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself at the moment,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say he’d always been that way. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero – from the time he showed me photos of him in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty expedition medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. And yet, a part of me still wants to stay devoted to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep it up, even on these cold days!’ I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Text: Mum caught Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly Grandpa's work, but different from anything he had done before, and it was not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. A river dominated the scene; it was not a river she recognized and maybe not even a real one, just a fantasy river. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely visible, just a hint of green, drawing the eye into the pale waters and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It's got a name."" There was something in her voice—too casual, too detached—that showed her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others make sense of them. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it—for him to be so specific. Maybe he's going to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't resist. It's such an unusual picture, especially having a name. I suppose you can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to every person who asks."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted her, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually to say the muse wasn't being kind to him that day, or that he'd have to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, having any influence over someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"Text: 'When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have cut the carpet by itself. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't mean to damage the carpet. I didn't wake up thinking, 'Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.' It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm very unlucky that way. What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute! It's small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it. I keep my collection of shells and fossils there. Gran knew I always loved her cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I have only two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But since Angela is only fifteen, I'll be in my small room for years. I don't mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... Then I had an idea. If I couldn't cut the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to 'think outside the box'. And that's exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"The novel ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly ‘borrow’ things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn’t want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming more complex. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres to get the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We developed a special technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off because it was sewn on every morning. The lead actor’s trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was shot with actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren’t there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren’t accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully conveyed the magic of the books."
48,"Text: Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren’t there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the ""can-you-get-me-free-tickets-to-your-dad’s-concerts?"" ‘Everything’s going to be fine,’ I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone with this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. To leave my old life on the road and with tour tutors. So while the rest of the band is renting here during the recording, we’re staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet real kids for a change. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so normal. I walk into the school’s main office. ‘Hi, I need my schedule please,’ I tell the school secretary. ‘Name?’ She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ‘Desert McGraw.’ ‘Desirée?’ she asks, leaning closer. ‘Desert,’ I repeat. The secretary seems confused. ‘Oh,’ she says and types ‘McGraw’ on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad uses his stage name. ‘What grade?’ ‘Eleventh.’ ‘One second, it’s printing,’ the secretary says. She hands me the schedule. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, so I wouldn’t look lost. When I get to the door, I hear the teacher taking roll. ‘Aurelio Gonzalez.’ ‘Here.’ She continues while I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes look over my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! ‘Nice shoes,’ she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. ‘Thanks,’ I say. The teacher pauses. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says. ‘Here.’ The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she gives us time to socialize! All teachers should do this. ‘So why’d you move here?’ my new friend asks. I have many choices. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ‘We need a change, Desert,’ he said, ‘and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.’ Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they pick South Beach Sounds, a studio near the sand? ‘My dad had to relocate,’ I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ‘What does he do?’ she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. ‘He’s an artist,’ I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ‘Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.’ And she doesn’t seem to care. Excellent."
49,"Text: 'Today, the average American teenage girl is expected to be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what being an American teenager is like now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and stay unnoticed, because being average is not enough. Not being ambitious is seen as laziness. Many adults forget how much pressure teenagers face today. They have lots of homework, tests, extra activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life,’ says teenager Kristen Loose. Despite these pressures being normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes about them still exist, often spread by the media. You know the stereotypes: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, it is not fair to label the whole generation this way. ‘Many people think we spend most of our time watching TV and using our phones,’ Loose says. She believes this is mostly wrong. She admits to keeping her phone close most of the day, but not just for fun. It is a tool that helps teens and those responsible for them. Students are expected to have access to the world and be reachable at all times, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can now do their work anywhere. Instead of listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities now need attention all day, adding to the stress of busy teens. Many teenagers start their day around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. Then, they have to do it all again the next day, often with less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teens get the recommended nine hours of sleep. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are so tired. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is not much. Olsen rarely spends this time on social media or TV. Instead, she focuses on volunteer work. ‘People think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests,’ Olsen says. Despite this image, Olsen says her favorite time of the week is when she volunteers. ‘I love helping others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community each week.’ In 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but they will still be proving it wrong and pushing the world forward. There will be another generation of students making a big impact, even before they finish school.'"
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the past few years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a science project with a twist: it’s part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These happen when a rock or metal piece enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, inflates the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chant, and the balloon rises. Some run and track it with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There is quiet and a sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappears. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the clear sky, just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I see a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon expands until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ says the group’s leader, who notes they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is becoming familiar with this landscape.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘These students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to others.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It’s a bit disappointing, but it’s a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountains. And it’s another adventure story to share."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. It happened by chance when she helped her younger brother with a science project about dinosaurs. She found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology, which fascinated her. Chloe decided then that she wanted to pursue this field. 

Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people at that time, so I asked Chloe about the support she received. She recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. Chloe was nervous at first, worried he might find her annoying. However, he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel more comfortable.

I asked Chloe about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. She admits that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She finds the portrayal of palaeontologists in films misleading, often showing them as either eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks. These films do not accurately represent their daily work.

Chloe explains that her job is varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. Communicating scientific findings to the public is also important to her, especially to young people. She believes it's crucial to clear up misunderstandings about science and inspire interest in the natural world.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, where she advised on the accuracy of the dinosaurs shown. She praises the makers for their knowledge and says she mostly checked that the dinosaurs depicted lived in the same time period. The documentary attracted audiences of all ages because it showed dinosaurs in a new, realistic way.

I asked Chloe why dinosaurs continue to fascinate us. She thinks they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. In a world that feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us there is still much to learn. Palaeontology, she says, is like a form of time travel."
52,"Text: ""I'm going to say this once: when you're traveling by car with your family, even if you're six years old, you probably know you're not 'there yet,' even as you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' The truth is, once you arrive, it's not 'there' anymore; it's 'here.' So, if you think you might be 'there,' you should ask 'Are we here yet?' And no one wants to be 'there' more than the parents who hear that question repeatedly on long car trips. Seriously, what are we kids complaining about? Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles, while the scenery passes by outside. In the front seat, mum or dad is there to give out snacks, change the radio, and keep everything running smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying – like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it's his other foot, then a hand, and soon he's in my space and we're fighting. The driver and co-pilot separate us, telling Tim to stay in his seat. This calms things down for a while. The scenery continues to pass by. Then, as I'm trying to read, I feel a breeze on my arm. But the window's not open. It's Tim, blowing on me from his seat. He's not touching me, so he's technically not doing anything wrong. But it makes me angry. Tim gets told off, and there's more swerving. Then things calm down again – for now. Over the years, Dad has developed ways to deal with us in the back seat. For example, when we ask 'Are we there yet?' he often says, 'Yes, we're here. Get out of the car.' 'But Dad, we're still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour.' 'Oh, then maybe we're not there yet.' That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you're finally 'there' when the grown-ups get out of the car and move away from the kids who have annoyed them for hours. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you're not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope customers will love the experience and return. Zuzi explains their motivation: ""With so much technology, everyone is busy on their phones. We wanted to bring people together without screens. It's natural for people to communicate face-to-face.""

The games in their café are called 'Eurogames', known for gentle themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone involved. This idea was developed further in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging social interaction. Pandemic, a Eurogame by North American designer Matt Leacock, is about solving global problems together. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He recalls, ""Playing it with friends was thrilling. Everyone felt good, win or lose. I wanted to create something similar.""

Leacock's love for board games started in childhood. He was often disappointed by games, so he and his uncle would redesign them. Pandemic became very successful, and its sequel added storytelling elements. Leacock says, ""It's like an electronic game where you develop characters and the world changes.""

The video game industry has helped board games become popular. Video games have made playing games normal. Ben Hogg, from a games company, says, ""Everyone with a smartphone plays games. More people are open to playing games now.""

Video games once offered social interaction in arcades or with friends at home. But as games moved online, players became physically separated. Some people missed playing games with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, games are a way to connect in real life, and this trend is growing."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many false beginnings. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him start playing the guitar. The only radio station he heard at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced him as he grew up. He was 12 before he heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. He says, ‘With tennis, I was at a high level, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was too much hard work.’ At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to pursue music, saying he wrote lyrics during economics lessons and played the piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. Eventually, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune did not come. He says, ‘In my artist career, I’ve often been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.’ Writing for others is where he truly succeeded. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK that labels send new artists to. This helps start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that writing with the charts in mind is okay. He asks, ‘Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?’ He believes they should write songs that are amazing and likely to sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone speak honestly about wanting to write number one hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he just knows he wants to write hits and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goal. ‘When I go into the studio, we need to aim for global success and write the best music of next year. It’s not just about being cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs,’ he says."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online but might be unknown to people who don't watch videos of bike stunts. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist.' This means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. 

I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys knew him well, and even older people came to say he was 'an absolute legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, Tony explained what he planned to do, and I often doubted he could do it. But he always succeeded. When I praised him, he seemed uninterested and a bit sad. 

Tony says he is a reluctant celebrity. He finds it hard to be social. He understands the importance of connecting with fans but prefers doing stunts to talking about them. This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. Tony says this technology helps people like him make a living. He sometimes feels everyone is too focused on cameras and screens, but he doesn't complain. His videos allow him to earn money from what would have been just a hobby in the past.

From my experience interviewing top athletes, I know two things are important to become an elite competitor: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. These are more important than talent and help athletes keep going despite failure. In risky sports, mental strength is crucial. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on easy obstacles but kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he takes unnecessary risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport. They don't know the technical details or that he gets expert advice to reduce risks. Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He believes it's wise to be aware of dangers. Some people never feel scared, but Tony feels fear and finds a way to overcome it. He is not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning. Before a new stunt, he prepares himself mentally. He knows he must stay focused to succeed."
56,"Text: 'Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many dangerous challenges for charity, like running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she already had some circus skills, she quickly found out that high-wire walking was very different. ‘The training was a shock,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t realize how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour after my day practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!’ The day of the actual challenge was windy, and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she admitted afterward. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ The experience has not stopped Helen, however, from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about traveling around Canada in a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a normal touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set out in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. A serious fever left him in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for hospital bills or the journey home. Yet despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"Text: 'I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night, because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about how to protect their habitat. The work is very hard. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but often it is wet. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we will look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this. And I wouldn't change it for anything!'"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from my company. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, and spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make, and I keep my colleagues happy by giving them samples! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm at our food lab, and other times I'm traveling to buy raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety and lack of routine, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! People often ask if I get bored of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more in the evening!'"
60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia says, “For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured, or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is planning for the future because you can only perform while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students start businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a job for making money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!”'"
61,"Text: 'You may not know her name or her face, but you’ve probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren’t good enough to be lead singers. That’s not true – they have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! ‘What I love about my job is that when I walk into the recording studio, I never know what I’ll be asked to sing,’ she says. ‘It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I’m often surprised by producers’ requests. I was once asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue, I just do the job!’ ‘Excellent musical abilities are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There’s often no printed music to look at. I’ll never forget my first experience of recording the background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra as well. I was terrified: I knew that if I got something wrong, it would mean recording everything again, which nobody enjoys. Recording sessions are long enough as they are.’ ‘One of my favourite jobs is doing recordings for songwriters. Less experienced writers don’t always understand which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it.’'"
62,"Text: Julie Deane started with only basic fashion knowledge and created a successful business with her 'satchels' - traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular with celebrities. Before choosing satchels, Julie considered different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning, instead of going with her first idea. Once she decided, not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, 'Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.' She involved her family from the start, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design came from children's storybooks. Although Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they have been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would mention them in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed of production. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a challenging time when another company copied Julie's design to sell similar products. As a result, she now ensures she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices – people love working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie loved cycling and bought a special racing bike to compete. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people aren’t sure if celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it to promote themselves, which can hide the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Ana Ronson, a singer-songwriter, grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother. Ana first sang in front of an audience at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to gain confidence. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher didn't listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her frustration. She posted it online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from across Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn't know the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. But Joss convinced her, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a fantastic evening. Ana prefers writing songs about difficult times rather than happy ones because she has more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes fans like her songs, her main goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew our great-grandparents had lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about what needed to be done. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people now lived along that coast. On the first morning, the only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. There were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far. I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like stress-free living!

When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father. I watched many of his games when I was a kid. You might think this would make me love basketball, but it didn't. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often read a book instead of watching the games. When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but already two meters tall. My sports teacher noticed my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training but thought I needed to improve my skills before playing a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I played against another school. Having my parents watch made me nervous, but it went well! For the next four years, I practiced every day and did well, even joining an adult team before moving to a sports academy in the USA at fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I didn't spend much time with friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly! I turned professional at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I was taller than most professional players since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to fix that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I found out that to get a licence, I needed to know a lot more than I had learned. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping the group together. You need other skills too. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You also need to handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might post a negative review online. Good reviews are important because they attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy usually lead to very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we didn't need to worry. 

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their food made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants! 

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. We led the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. We chose this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn’t include meat, which we don’t like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I certainly will!"
69,"Text: 'I’m Gina D’Costa and I run a flower shop in the UK. We don’t just sell flowers to people buying them for friends or their homes; many different customers want flowers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in Reception, and sometimes we help with photo sessions for businesses by providing flowers for their advertising pictures. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of what we did. My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I must be crazy, but it doesn’t bother me – I’m excited about my work. It’s often colder than I’d like, and it’s usually dark, but that’s normal at that time in the morning, so I don’t let it worry me. The flower market is wonderful, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make choosing difficult. If I was choosing for myself, I’d probably only get pink ones – it’s my favourite colour. But I must remember that what I love and what other people want aren’t always the same. It isn’t always possible to find customers’ choices – not all flowers are available all year. I don’t really like having to argue about prices with the flower-sellers, but it’s a necessary part of the job. Flowers aren’t cheap, so I have to try to get the best price possible. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I’ve bought. Then we create bunches of flowers and work out how much orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive they are, and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like. Some people might think this sounds like too much trouble, but I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest possible flowers for the amount of money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things – I wouldn’t want any other job!'"
70,"Text: 'My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. The website’s been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve visited to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed.'"
71,"Text: 'Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, so I decided to do something special. I started a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I started. After a few weeks, I decided to put these photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was surprised to find that some people liked how I saw and photographed things. I also enjoyed taking photos of many different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common topic, my project would be better. I agreed and began to focus on taking photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing—they were taking color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost gave up, but I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough to work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.'"
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. I decided to take the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made great relationships with the children. Now, I am there for about four hours a week and I always look forward to going.

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before starting at the club, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was so young that I hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After this, I quickly developed a love for the sport and improved my skills. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored of snowboarding, but my love for competing and winning has grown stronger as I’ve gotten older. This helps me push myself harder. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That achievement made me trust my abilities more. During the summer, I focus on training and my studies because there’s no snow. Although I train every day, it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. It helps me deal with not being able to do what I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering becoming a doctor if my active life allows time for college. It’s hard to imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I can’t snowboard my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a valuable lesson from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I found it easier than I expected. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they liked them, but I thought they were just being nice. To see if others would like them, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery to take home as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just us at a market stall! That’s when I knew it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I’ve made a lot of money through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It’s been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview about her book, Janine said, ""Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, fits into a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination for that."" Janine started her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia mentions that, even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the characters face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a very long novel, she has shown she’s a better writer than some other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!"""
76,"Text: 'I’m Tom, I’m fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved into a castle on a small island! It all started when my father was invited to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was happy because he thought he wouldn’t get such a great chance again, but it took some time before the rest of us agreed that Dad should take the job. We were just thinking about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle probably wouldn’t be as comfortable as our cozy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very friendly in summer because it attracts lots of visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren’t as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island, which often involves lots of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day, back to my old school. I was looking forward to going on stormy days when there are huge waves – but the ferries don’t run then! And I’ve discovered that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I’m always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, for example when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see a thing, then within hours it’s brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get awful storms, and I wonder sometimes if the castle’s strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it’s been here for centuries – and it’s still standing!'"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m almost there. On family holidays abroad, I’ve had the chance to see birds from other countries, too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I’ve learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it and said it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a good player. However, my family knew I often got interested in new hobbies and then stopped, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one referee noticed I was a promising player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started training regularly with a big club at 13 years old. After that, I improved a lot. Despite this, people still doubted I’d become a star player, which made me a bit upset. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. Fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football and to give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team if they work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"Text: 'In recent years, a key change in higher education in the UK and around the world has been to encourage new students to get involved in research early in their studies. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries. Instead, research is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in jobs, because they help you think about the world and do your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat it; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? What do we really think about the facts, views, or beliefs we are given? Why does it matter? These questions are the basis of research. Research can range from complex, groundbreaking studies by highly trained people to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about issues, practices, and events. Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have done research for projects and answered questions at school or work. You have asked questions that led to investigations since you first became interested in studying. You have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, choosing a music system, or shopping online. In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas, and creating your own responses and knowledge are expected. Some students may find this difficult because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and authorities, and you might feel you need to be told what is important to learn. However, in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process might seem daunting. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research of others is useful to students, academics, and in jobs, but we need to do more than just repeat what we read. We need to engage with it, think about it, test it, and see if it is logical, reasoned, and supported by evidence. We should not rely uncritically on facts and information given to us by others.'"
80,"Cities have always been places of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities are creative hubs, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. Although city life is known to be tiring, new research shows that it can also reduce our ability to think clearly. One major reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they offer a break from city life. This research is important as more people now live in cities than ever before. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. These unnatural environments affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy street, our brains must track many things: distracted people, traffic, and the confusing city layout. These tasks drain our mental energy because cities are full of stimuli, forcing us to constantly focus and refocus. This process uses a lot of brain power. In contrast, natural settings are easier on the brain. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature helps restore our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge. Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about city life and tried to include nature in urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer a break from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While people try many ways to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or office redesigns, few are as effective as a walk in nature. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Why do they remain centers of intellectual life? Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that cause attention problems, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities drives creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a place of intellectual breakthroughs, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are creative technology centers. Less crowded cities may produce less innovation over time. The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people feel, ""I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city!"""
81,"**Simplified Text:**

Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain scans to show this. However, I believe the study of the mind should not stop at the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as neurons, are part of human thinking. Archaeology shows that stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have played a role in human evolution and the development of the mind. So, what is outside the head might also be part of the mind.

It is easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually have around them. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limits of brain-scanning machines. But this often hides the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I do not question the brain's role in thinking, but I suggest that the mind is more than just the brain. It is useful to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world.

This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how these ways have changed since ancient times and what these changes mean for how we think. This approach gives new insights into what minds are by changing what we know about how objects help the mind.

Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The stick and the person become one, showing how minds and objects are connected. The blind person uses the stick to turn touch into sight, and the stick plays an active role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. This example shows that human intelligence can change by using new tools. My approach sees the human mind as always evolving.

It is important to remember that, throughout history, the 'stick' has been a pathway, not a boundary. Through the 'stick', humans explore and understand the world. This is different from a monkey using a stick to get food. For humans, 'sticks' satisfy our curiosity. This unique human trait explains why we make things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds change as they interact with the material world.

I want to include material objects in understanding the mind. MET offers a new way to see how different forms of material culture, from stone tools to smartphones, have shaped and changed how we think. Mind-changing technology sounds futuristic, but humans have used it since they first evolved."
82,"Photography is one of the few inventions that has greatly changed how we see the world. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became a part of American culture. It influenced many areas, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians say that photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. Photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discussions, so to understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so popular? First, because it was a mechanical process, it matched the growing interest in technology in the US, where change was seen as normal. Like steam power and railroads, photography made the world feel smaller by bringing images of distant places into people's homes. Second, the camera was a tool for self-representation, important in a country where personal and national identities were always changing. Third, the camera helped families create and keep memories, even if they were idealized. Lastly, the realistic nature of photographs matched the American artists' focus on realism and everyday life.

A photograph draws attention to what the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""This, you should see!"" Because a photograph is made by a machine, it is a record of what was in front of the camera, giving it a sense of objectivity. However, since it is taken by a person, it also has a personal point of view, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, but its meaning is more complex. No image is shown to us without some context, like a caption or its placement in a magazine or gallery, which affects how we understand it.

To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and how it was first seen. The same image can be seen in different places and times, and its meaning can change. The camera's importance to artists was once a secret, but now it is widely recognized. For decades, starting with US artist Andy Warhol, artists have used photographs in their work in many ways. Photographic vision has become an essential part of art, working alongside painting to shape our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, which includes our thoughts and feelings, and we try to understand it. James was interested in human psychology, which he believed included thoughts and feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not be influenced by scientific facts. We often act as amateur psychologists when we give opinions on why people behave in certain ways, like feeling unhappy or quitting their jobs. Problems occur when people have different views. Formal psychology tries to find the most likely explanations for these situations. Psychologists help us separate subjective thoughts from scientific facts. Although psychology is about the mind, psychologists do not fully understand the brain's role in our experiences and behavior. They study behavior to make guesses about what happens inside us. Psychology is like solving a puzzle, using clues from careful observation and analysis. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. It helps us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life, such as improving teaching methods, designing safer machines, and helping people communicate their feelings. Psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, but scientific investigation began only 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to study the mind, but this method has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of brain activity. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows the less successful side of consumer capitalism, where products like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola ended up because almost nobody wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story of failure for the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business. Many companies do not keep their own collections of failed products, so executives visit the museum to learn from these mistakes. The museum started by accident when Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, began collecting new products in the 1960s. He wanted to create a 'reference library' of consumer products, not just failures. However, he discovered that most products fail, so his collection naturally became a museum of unsuccessful items.

Today's culture of optimism might explain why these products failed. People involved in creating them might not have realized they were doomed, or they might have continued investing in them to save face. Often, little effort is made to understand why a product failed, and people prefer not to talk about it. This focus on optimism is also common in the self-help industry, where 'positive visualization' is popular. The idea is that if you imagine things going well, they are more likely to do so. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that people tend to be overly optimistic about their ability to influence events, which might be linked to evolution. However, psychologist Gabriele Oettingen discovered that thinking too positively about the future can reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a 'fixed theory' mindset think ability is innate, so they see failure as proof they are not good enough. In contrast, those with an 'incremental theory' believe ability grows with effort and challenges. They see failure as a sign they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger after being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success."
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many theories about home advantage. On the other hand, people who invest money in sports wonder if home advantage should matter at all. If players are paid well, shouldn't they perform well anywhere? 

What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their support is crucial for the team. Fans often think that when they cheer, it leads to goals, but they forget the times when nothing happened despite their cheering. 

However, one thing that seems true is that home fans can influence referees. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This suggests that referees try to avoid making decisions that would upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar. Despite these changes, home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball focuses more on individual players than teamwork.

Another reason for home advantage could be psychological. Research shows that players have higher testosterone levels before home games, which might be linked to a natural instinct to defend their home ground. This was seen in the Rugby World Cup, where home teams won against stronger opponents by showing determination and aggression. As one referee said, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’'"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous among athletes and coaches. It suggests that practice leads to improvement, not luck. This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate: is talent something you are born with, or can it be developed? The debate often seems one-sided, with many believing that practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for the idea that 10,000 hours of practice can make someone an expert in any field. This theory has inspired books like Malcolm Gladwell’s 'Outliers' and 'Talent Is Overrated,' which argue that practice is key to success.

However, in his book, Epstein challenges this idea. He points out that studies often focus only on successful people, which can be misleading. Epstein explores why some people excel while others do not, considering factors like environment, support, and determination. His research takes him around the world, even to Alaska, where he learns that sled dogs’ success might be due to both their genes and their training. This suggests that determination might also have a genetic component.

Epstein distinguishes between 'hardware' (nature) and 'software' (nurture) and believes both are important for elite athletes. He acknowledges the role of training and environment but also highlights cases where genetics play a crucial role. He discusses race and gender, questioning why men and women compete separately if practice is the only factor that matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most revealing."""
87,"Text: 'A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks: why are children today so unhappy? In her book, Kith, Griffiths explains that children spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers, and have lost touch with nature. She believes this is the main problem. This idea is supported by other studies on childhood today. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, when they spent time exploring outdoors, swimming, or building dens. They think this was healthier than the way children live now. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have made life more protective for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds. Griffiths' book includes strong arguments. She talks about the fear of danger that keeps children indoors and how it benefits the toy and gadget industry. She also discusses trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. Some of these rules might be exaggerated, but Griffiths expresses her views passionately. She also talks about childhood freedoms and rules, from fairy tales to school regulations. While her arguments are interesting, Griffiths sometimes takes them too far. She even compares modern treatment of children to racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths is very romantic about children. She mostly sees them in an ideal way, which might not match reality. For example, she says 'children are the musicians of thought,' but this might not be true for all kids. The main idea of the book is that children should have freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths thinks children need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are 'the right size.' Also, not all children might want the adventurous life Griffiths describes. Some children are naturally quiet and cautious. Maybe the real issue is forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside.'"
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my schooling. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the value of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their way of life depends more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills children need to live happy, productive, moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We no longer need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate obstacles, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play'. He developed his concept of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit anytime. To keep the game going, players must keep others happy. This makes play very democratic. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, warnings from experts, less cohesive neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow direct contact with potential employers, similar to standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, this access also increases the chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to use her contacts to get a job. The executive was upset by this request and sent a harsh rejection note, which went viral online. Many people were shocked by the note, and the executive might regret her tone. However, this incident highlights the importance of using social media carefully for job hunting. Social media can be risky for job seekers who don't know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes.

There is irony here because social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of twentysomethings for years. For my generation, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress and experiment, often based on fantasy. You could have long conversations online and then ignore the person at school. By choosing certain pictures or songs for your Facebook page, you could create a different persona. But when using social media for professional networking, this experience can be a disadvantage. Professional networking is very different, and some young people don't see the difference. We first became active online by being bold and confident, which might explain why some still think this is a good approach. Just because many people liked your Facebook posts doesn't mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you're worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn't apply now, and we must meet employers' standards to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too familiar and seem arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of our generation as entitled. In reality, many young people are desperate to find jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can harm their job prospects, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, mass emails, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it requires careful handling to avoid negative outcomes."
90,"Text: 'Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If we look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to a half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre says that only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people say that printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist said books and theatre were finished, but theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has done well even with TV, and cinema has survived videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales up 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. People also started to believe that everything is always changing, and they needed regular news updates. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and big events like famine or disease. Journalism as a job you could live on didn't really exist before the 19th century. Even then, it wasn't clear why people needed news every day or week. Regular newspaper publication can be limiting. Online news lets readers choose what is important to them. Search engines and algorithms help us find news that matches our interests. Online news can update stories quickly and correct mistakes. There are no space limits, and we can often see full documents or events. This is very different from newspapers. However, online news often focuses on being first and getting reader comments, which can create confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we are going back to that. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might disappear, or they might help us understand our complex world.'"
91,"Text: 'If humans were truly comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many nocturnal animals do. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This is a basic part of our genetics, even if we don't often think of ourselves this way. This explains why we have changed the night by adding light to it. We have filled the night with artificial light, similar to how we control rivers with dams. This has benefits but also causes problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just beginning to study. Light pollution mostly comes from poor lighting design, where artificial light shines into the sky instead of focusing downward. This bad lighting changes the natural darkness, affecting the light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it can affect life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's largest city. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few houses had gas lighting, and there were no public gaslights in the streets yet. From a few miles away, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but it is not. Many mammals are nocturnal. Light is a strong biological force and attracts many species. It is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds are 'captured' by searchlights or gas flares, circling until they fall. Birds migrating at night can crash into brightly lit buildings; young birds on their first journey are especially at risk. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd times because of artificial light. People once thought light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need a perfect night sky for work, but we do need darkness. Ignoring darkness is pointless. It is as important for our health as light. Changing our natural rhythms can cause health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological reflection of Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so important that changing them is like altering our balance. In the end, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs near a bright highway. Living in our own bright world, we have lost touch with our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the natural day-night cycle. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, which is best understood under a deep night sky with the Milky Way above.'"
92,"The founder of a large international company recently announced that his company will stop tracking employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by an internet company with a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by his media team. Ignoring the way the announcement was made, we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want if it doesn't harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work better. The founder of the multinational said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team are up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much you prepare, there is always work waiting when you return. This is the nature of taking leave; work piles up and is out of your control. Someone following these rules might not take leave at all or feel guilty about it. Guilt can lead to stress, and not taking enough leave can reduce productivity over time. There could also be pressure from colleagues and gossip about who is off and for how long. This pressure already affects when people start and end their workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotions. If the security of guaranteed leave is removed, people might feel they can't take the leave they need, fearing they look lazy. They would lose their legal right to fall back on. The policy might result in workers not taking their leave or using their legal rights as a guideline, making the policy pointless. Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, blurring work and leisure time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours accurately, why use an old standard for time off? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Employees might not know if their hours are being watched, leading them to monitor themselves, which can be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like better morale and creativity, can exist without harming worker well-being. I doubt that ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Text: 'Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in the same field examine a scientific research paper. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. This process is supposed to stop flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often mention it to reassure the media and the public. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trust in published research? The answer is both yes and no. Examining these issues shows that scientific publishing is changing. I am not ready to give up on journal-based peer review. I still think papers should be checked before they are formally published, but I feel changes happening. The use of preprints, which are drafts of papers posted online without peer review, is an important part of this change. Preprints allow new results to be shared quickly so they can be read, critiqued, and built upon. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers, which affects both authors and reviewers. Competition for spots in top journals pushes scientists to do their best work, but it also encourages cutting corners. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good. For top journals, this can depend on how newsworthy a paper is, not just its scientific quality. These problems are known, but few people want to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a big change from the norm. Preprint archives have existed for twenty years, but they are not widely used. This slow adoption is partly because scientists are conservative and because many believe journals won't accept papers that have been posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review will lead to 'junk science', but this hasn't happened yet. Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but authors know they will be critiqued by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience: ‘My paper critiqued a published paper, which is hard to do in traditional journals. With anonymous peer review, the original authors might block a critical paper, or they might not be chosen as reviewers and could complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their points. All comments are public, so readers can judge the arguments. Rejection by journals is less of a problem because the preprint and comments are still available, so our work isn't wasted.’ Preprint archives allow global scientific discussions that used to happen only between individuals. They could also be a place for negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Being on preprint archives increases how often papers are read and cited, showing the effectiveness of sharing through preprints. By using the web's openness and the collaborative spirit in the scientific community, preprints can help focus on the work itself, not just where it is published.'"
94,"Text: 'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say ‘a painting in words’. These answers don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked them to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist, and another from the object's point of view, titled ‘Poem.’ One student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I’m used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. The item? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works differently from anything else. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. When I was in school, poetry confused me. I thought poems were puzzles that blocked true understanding and feeling. After school, many people lose interest in poetry. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it’s not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down because it seems dull or hard to understand. Still, you feel proud for trying. What do we want from poems? Aren’t they supposed to hold deep feelings, beautiful images, or sharp wit? The answer seems yes. But for tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. Yet, a poem can offer something unique: ambiguity. Life is full of it, unlike straightforward reading. But this doesn’t explain what a poem really is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it leads to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of literary art using language’s aesthetic and rhythmic qualities.’ This is academic language, but it hides the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable, unpredictable – or to machines – precise and human-made – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t hold up. The value in comparing a poem to something else is not in the comparison itself but in the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps us see familiar things in a new way. A poem as a mental object is easy to imagine, especially since song lyrics often stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think of a poem in a newspaper or magazine: A poem can impact us like nothing else, even though it’s just ink on paper like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem – space that could be used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it doesn’t become a commodity like they do. Publishers send out press releases and review copies of poetry collections, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not for the market but for its own sake. Because it’s special – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment.'"
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I've enjoyed finding every brooch and coin because it makes me feel connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I couldn't ignore it and started digging. Half a meter down, I saw a rounded, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, like curtain rails I had found before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, I saw it was a fat, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a beautiful necklace of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to my car and drove home, staring at it on the seat beside me. I rinsed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had had in ages. ‘Marion!’ I called, ‘I've got something for you.’ She came in, stopped, and asked, ‘What is it?’ I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been burgled, but I was anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says you must report such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned, stopped mid-sentence, and stared. The torc was authenticated and sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask if I'll stop detecting now that I've found something so amazing. But those brooches and coins are still interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing. There's always the chance of a bigger fish tomorrow."
96,"Text: 'Sleeping is one of my favorite parts of traveling, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When friends describe their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian beds? Better sleep is a happy side effect of travel. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and dream more than I thought possible. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I don't think just relaxing explains why travel sleep feels so different. I believe sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, and smells. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. During sleep, we process all this new information. No wonder sleep feels more intense when traveling. Sleep also changes with different places. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local culture affects me more than time zones. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I truly belong. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all felt sleepy and lay down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is also memorable. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my dreams. If 'slow travel'—enjoying each experience fully instead of rushing—is what modern travelers aim for, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too.'"
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said diplomatically to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking like a bulldog. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about Jen's friend, Tattie, whom they knew nothing about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia's husband Jeff had said, ""Tattie? What sort of name is that?"" Mia replied, ""It's short for Tatiana. I think it’s nice."" Jeff thought it sounded pretentious. He didn't like anything showy and believed in speaking his mind. He wouldn't have hesitated to tell the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said a trash can lid would look better. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. Her commute from work was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends that there was a demand for the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. After Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in Little Pelham, where they could try on many hats in a relaxed setting. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she started selling handbags and costume jewelry as well."
98,"Text: 'Lawrence Okoye has traveled a long way from London to Atlanta. In his new American home, he reflects on his incredible sports journey. Lawrence is confident, but even he is surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Despite never playing American football before, Lawrence might be chosen for one of the top USA teams. In Atlanta, he is still learning his new position. It seems unbelievable that a 21-year-old from London could be selected for a top American sports team, but Lawrence is used to overcoming doubts. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but delayed it to focus on discus, after playing rugby. In just 20 months, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, aiming for the world championships. He confirms that he decided to try American football only after arriving in the USA. At school in London, he had thought about it, but it seemed unrealistic then. Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he applied for the trials. Was he nervous about competing with experienced players? ‘No,’ he says. ‘I don’t get nervous for many things.’ Lawrence is not very talkative, but he believes in his abilities. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ‘I was very pleased to hear that,’ he says, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is cautious. Without any basic experience, how can he join an NFL team? ‘Coaches say I have the right skills. It’s about how hard I work,’ he replies. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he’s selected? ‘I am. There’s no pressure on me. Many people think I’ll be selected, but I’m not worried.’ This calmness might come from his Olympic experience, where he finished last in the discus final. He seems to have moved past this and is happy he made it to the final with a great last throw. ‘That was an amazing day,’ he says. ‘The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s sport. I can return to it.’ After the Olympics, some thought the event had affected him negatively. Lawrence doesn’t comment on this. The minimum salary for an NFL player is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on one sport? ‘I understand why someone would say that,’ he responds. ‘I’m trying to achieve something I dreamed of as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought through.’'"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, it had not yet started snowing in Siberia. I could see no sign of human life, and the view stretched out in a mix of mountains, streams, and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said, pronouncing my name with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to the far edges of civilization to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with the help of a dictionary, I had managed to explain to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he reasoned with me, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it these days. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and with just one word ""Holodna"" (cold), he pointed outside. I tried to reassure him by explaining with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I left out the fact that, because my trip was self-funded, I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment had been bought at low prices. In reality, I was not sure they would be good enough. This was especially true of my large postman’s over-trousers, which I had bought for £10. It had all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall that morning was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes, without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me slouched Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job did tick many important boxes for me. It was frequently challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were great long holidays in which to chase adventures. Twice since I had started teaching, I had used these holidays to go to meet Al. He had caught the adventuring bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and so had decided to do something far more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. Ever since that first ride we had taken together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times he thought that the ride, or the road, would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could deal with each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the skeptics who had told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to take part. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed I was in good health, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned I needed to stay oriented. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" I was told. ""The pilot will explain where to look."" I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were on the runway, my legs were up, trying not to touch the steering pedals, and my hands were avoiding the switches. My mind was made up: I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense up and relax at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea. None of this was comforting as we started down the runway.

Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. It was a sudden move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for the small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was interrupted by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even done any acrobatics yet.

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too—it’s that responsive. Then Dario said something. I asked him to repeat it, but instead, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle. I know many people find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, as we flew upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience in a race. To show this, Dario ate sandwiches right after we landed. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed of doing loops over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you’ve ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. His favorite temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about surviving in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very difficult. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. This meant swimming in very cold water and facing frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, planning an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers are confident and driven people, and they need to be. This time, there is much more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, measuring the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this job. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tough by sending him out into blizzards with few clothes. His father shared a love of icy adventures, and Pen had unusual physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he’s at home: ‘He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic.’ For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horseback compete against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he admits. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in how I said goodbye. I told my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He took it seriously, but it was too much pressure. It was well-meaning but unfair.’ For similar reasons, he plans to have little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending his last days before leaving preparing his equipment carefully. ‘Out on the ice, you can’t fix things easily,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will have a support team of six flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for someone like him, says Pen, and he has other worries too. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I haven’t trained as much as I’d like.’ Why? ‘Organisational tasks always seem more urgent. So I’m almost afraid of what I’ll ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge that inspired past explorers. ‘Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,’ he admits, ‘and not very useful to others. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re trying to involve as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which seemed strange and not needed, are now very important. Suddenly, we’re useful again.’"
103,"Text: I had a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. These activities were great, but I missed having a competitive goal. I wanted to stay in shape in case I wanted to compete in the Olympics again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. I knew if I entered, I would want to win. Would Ben be the best partner to win? Probably not. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had found the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to consider the loss of earnings from being away. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete. It's nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I could talk about something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but straightforward. I trained almost every day, but the program was set, with doctors and dieticians. I was worried about people's reactions to me racing with a TV presenter. I worried it would look like I just wanted to be on TV. My concerns disappeared during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and a year on a deserted island. But he couldn't row. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I was feeling restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty, maybe because of the noise and crowds in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to over 100. Recently, they took over a second place – the 'wilderness farm’, which they said was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I look at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies; I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out of the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of flowers and leaves. But I think I see the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forest – thin trees covered in snow – stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely inside when I’m given boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes very loud by the time I reach the dogsheds. Three people are running back and forth, harnessing the huskies to sleds. The dogs are very excited, pulling hard on the ropes. I can hardly hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much anyway. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light. November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a tough questioning about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m unsure. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in freezing conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is full of instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around by very eager huskies. But I feel triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after a bike accident during training. Radcliffe says the achievement never really felt real to her. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but at the time, it just felt like what she was meant to do. Her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried she might not keep up the pace and could drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, but he understood why someone might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she ran the last part in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast but still managed to sprint the rest in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run quicker than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would come close to that time soon, but Radcliffe thought she could do it again next year. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. After the race, people wondered how she, with her awkward running style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her for weeks, helping her handle the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could take that level of pain. She would push me to work so deeply into her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to her training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no time for a break; she wanted a two-hour session right away. Hartmann gave so much time to Radcliffe that other athletes became resentful. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has broken her record? ‘Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people race each other more than themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never relaxing, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me to it. I never thought, “I can relax now,” it was always: “keep pushing as hard as you can.” Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She never ran as fast again, but she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I didn't know how viewers and the press would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our show added something new to this, but I was still worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques, but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often very physical, with travel and exploration. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was left out. 'Where's steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?' I could imagine people asking. But after long discussions, the TV team and I created a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book's title, I knew I wasn't claiming the recipes were 'definitive'. But I thought that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying ideas and changing them until you have something unique. The TV series let me explore foods, people, and places I hadn't seen before, and I was excited about that. Searching for the best ingredients took me around the world. Some of my adventures included being taken to a canning factory that processed the wrong type of tomato, and visiting a dairy farm with such low standards that we had to stop filming! While refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine, and nearly burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza.'"
107,"Text: 'We were still hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the bonnet. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets. Finally, he said, ‘Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,’ and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field was big, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I repeated, because it was safest to agree with Bea. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John get smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’ So I told them about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and a fight over a worm. ‘That’s silly, no one understands bird language,’ Bea said. My eyes stung. ‘I do.’ But my voice wasn’t convincing. ‘Liar.’ I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ‘Mum…?’ But she was asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind and waved at her through the windows. We followed John into a café near the road where our van was parked. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘It might be expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum said, and we sat on the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ‘It’s like syrup in there,’ she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. ‘It’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said when it got dark. Mum made a bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ‘I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,’ John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John driving it. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we’d get home since our van needed to be towed. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I fell asleep.'"
108,"Lucy was at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her: one was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, whose name Lucy didn't catch because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the pieces they were playing, their recent travels, and future plans. 

‘I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,’ Lucy told them. It sounded impressive, even though she didn't really want to go. She often did things she didn't want to, like concerts and competitions that took her around the world. She missed so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore and worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco instead. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she got in. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate, and her little brother Gus imagined himself at the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her repertoire. But Lucy hadn't applied; her mom had sent in the form and CD. ‘I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,’ her mom said. Lucy thought it was more like her mom didn't want to give her the chance to say no. Back then, Lucy thought disagreeing was the worst thing to do, so she didn't try to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward, surprised. ‘Tanglewood?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘How old are you?’ ‘Fifteen.’ He exchanged a glance with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ‘Wow.’ Lucy hadn't meant to brag. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was showing off. ‘It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying...’ Liesel/Louisa excused herself, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. Tokyo stayed. ‘Have you ever been to Japan?’ He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were rebel music nerds. ‘Once. When I was, like, eight.’ He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ‘Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.’ He took her arm and led her away. ‘And don't get too friendly with the competition.’ ‘They're not the competition.’ ‘Everyone is the competition.’ Her grandfather took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, only half-listening. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ‘You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’ She liked being somebody, even if it made some people jealous or think she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn't earn her respect from her school friends. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. He’s hard to argue with, so I decided to see what experts say – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is a key part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do – they live in it. It’s not about whether it’s good or bad – it’s how you use it that matters.’ How does our social networking compare with what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at the youth club, as today’s parents did when they were younger, to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. It helps teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and get along with their peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity: you can post about your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see that other people have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He says that using social media can help if you’re shy: ‘Communicating online can be more comfortable than face-to-face, and there may be benefits from practicing social skills in a less threatening environment.’ Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how younger people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help if you’re quiet and have a special interest because they let you connect with others who like the same things. ‘If you’re one of only three people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people who like the same thing, you can still be popular, just in a different way,’ he says. Pauline White, a digital education expert, told me something interesting: ‘It’s people your age who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people, and create their own content who are really using the potential of social networks.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasting, and blogging about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites, she says, are changing creativity. Keen photographers can connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interest. ‘This all adds to employability and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness – and you need to understand how it works to create customers. For example, if you develop a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they’re all potential customers. If you link all those networks, there’s your customer base.’ Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age.’"""
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first idea. However, my parents had a different plan for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to organize a big family trip, which seemed like a teenager's worst nightmare. He and my mom kept saying, ‘Not enough people do this anymore,’ while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ‘There are probably good reasons why!’ In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough room left for us, we started our ‘Family Great American Road Trip’. As we left our comfortable home for smaller places over the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into. We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway in a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way! The next day, we were up early and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that tourist town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. Climbing to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of old and new. Dodging construction traffic became normal. We laughed as we posed by the big “CLOSED” signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ‘Bear jams’, managed by park volunteers, were common when traffic stopped to let a bear cross. Our own close encounter with a bear on the road (and a worried park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the hotel we stayed in, with its problems, couldn’t ruin our excitement - a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service. But in return, I saw the most amazing views. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don’t need to go to a faraway place to find something special. It was both happy and sad to be home again, but at least I hadn’t argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos of our journey to look through. And I knew that for me, the best memories would be the unplanned, spontaneous moments.'"
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living under the care of the college Head. She was happy to have the best room at the college, with a kitchen and study area, and free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still keep an eye on Amy.

Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Rose was ten when she last saw her grandmother, but her memories were happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked bringing people together. Rose expected dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady and seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But Rose wanted her independence. She wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, or go out without asking for permission every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone for emergencies. Rose was thrilled. They agreed it would be about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be overbearing. If there were issues, they would talk about it.

Rose had never been a wild child. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports were good and her exam results excellent. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this was the last time, as she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the mosaic of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed challenging. At 13, she decided to try it. Now, the novel she started then is about to be published. When she told her former teacher, the teacher was surprised, thinking Charlotte would write a book at 30 or 40. Charlotte didn’t see why she should wait if she had a chance to be good at it.

On a winter afternoon at her publisher's office, I was surprised to see a 15-year-old girl ready to discuss her book. The book is impressive: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing, except the heroine's age, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us, but Charlotte doesn’t need any help. She is confident, intelligent, and steady, avoiding overconfidence.

Charlotte admits she is young and talks about the complex moral issues in her book. She says, ‘I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t think my understanding of the world is limited by my age, but I’m not particularly wise. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.’

She has a theory about how teenagers are shown in books. She says there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager, and the awkward one. Reading about these types annoyed her. ‘What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who aren’t inadequate. Some writers unintentionally suggest teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-belief.’

Charlotte loves reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ‘Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I could do it.’ She praises a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which advises that if the reader can guess what happens next, the suspense is lost.

Some might think Charlotte’s parents, both journalists, helped her get published. Her father’s connection in publishing got her book read initially. She knows she was lucky because getting a first novel read is hard, no matter the author’s age. ‘Every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you’re on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don’t take things for granted,’ Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping, wanted to show he knew what he was doing. He went first, skiing down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing. Even to us, something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle stuff. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it. If I’d tried to join the skateboarders, I’d have risked being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. It had a big indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students leapt, trying new tricks, and landed in pits of foam cubes – not a realistic introduction to the slopes. After practising indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – once you’re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again. Land in the zone and you keep moving forward, reducing impact. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain and race towards the jump. My legs would almost go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came down onto the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines in the centre. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was addictive. Some drills copied moves we’d make while ski-jumping, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing as you spun in space. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I was aware of the moment before take-off, and nothing more until I was lying in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as happy as me, and for a few moments, I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last long. On the final run of the day, I didn’t slow down as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed in the zone. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you grip the harness tightly. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There is a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park. It is surprising that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are such a big industry. To create the excitement and escape that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it is a real challenge. Designers must create the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe. They also need to add new features to keep visitors interested. Although people might think rollercoasters have become more extreme, many techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the tracks made by specialist manufacturers. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, an engineering expert, explained that it involves quickly changing between different forces so people feel excited but safe. The goal is to create a thrilling ride without making people feel uncomfortable. To make a great ride, teams must create a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or the most twists. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a theme park development director, agreed that designers need to understand what passengers want and test the rides themselves. I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add something extra, like painting an old rollercoaster, but the physical ride experience will remain the most important for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already achieved a lot as a choreographer, creating works for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances occasionally. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day,’ she says. As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching young students. ‘A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re willing to take risks. They want success, but they don’t yet know their strengths and weaknesses. This means they accept even harsh criticism. They might still question me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There may be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces – it’d help lift the mood when rehearsals are tough. But I’m always working on big productions where the music is already set by the composer and can’t be changed.’

Miranda doesn’t want to attach herself to one institution. ‘I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to adapt each time I go somewhere new, rather than do the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’

We talk about a recent documentary on ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one tries to show viewers what life is really like in a dance company. There was a scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I recognized that. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch but not made up for the cameras. The public underestimates the work and dedication involved in ballet.’

I ask what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – comes together. Perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. That’s disappointing.’

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to develop expertise in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, though I might one day be known for one thing. For now, I want to widen my horizons.’"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there’s so much to experience? That conversation gave me the idea for my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.'"
117,"Text: 'When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although still puzzled, he showed me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained a support boat would be with us all the time, and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim and I was nervous. I’d trained in my local pool, and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I’d hoped to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was happy when I finally managed it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.'"
118,"Being a flight attendant isn't easy, but since I started, I've traveled everywhere, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. It's a great job for someone young like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, so I often flew alone. I felt lonely and would ask flight attendants if I could help give out meals, and some let me. I remembered this when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for something new. At the interview, there were many young people, and many were accepted. They were often well-qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say, focusing on my strengths and work experience, not just my love for travel. I got the job! I recommend this work to anyone because there are many benefits, but free flights aren't the main one. Most airline staff work very hard, and there's a saying: ""no-one's finished till everyone's finished."" It's like a big family. Even though we don't see each other all the time, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to take work home. If I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I probably won't see them again!"
119,"Text: 'At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do have children who miss home at the beginning of the week. Surprisingly, it's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can phone home after lunch. Then when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days, and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. We do get parents who are on the phone all the time, asking how their child is doing, which is quite unnecessary. Often their son or daughter will be busy, playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back another time. We often get a certain type of child coming, typically dressed in expensive new clothes. Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but before long they understand the reason why.'"

Doing the show with only British actors was difficult. In the UK, there are more rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they’ve just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, but it’s been full every night. Everyone wants to hear the songs that were first popular in America. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the actors. ‘It’s great that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have normal school lessons each day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre has special deals on tickets for schools. They loved it and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I didn’t know. Jamie helped me, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s ability and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! While the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it’s worth seeing.'"
