1,C2,"'A website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. It said that when you say, ""Hey, I’m here,"" you are telling everyone, even people you don’t know. This shows that sharing too much online can be bad. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. We share stories and photos, but sometimes we share too much and it can be dangerous. 
A long time ago, some people started sharing their lives online. They were the first bloggers. They lost jobs and friends because of what they shared. One of them was Justin Hall. In 1994, he started sharing his life on the internet. He wrote about everything, even personal things. But one day, he had to stop because it made people not trust him.
Another person, Heather Armstrong, wrote about her job on her blog. Someone at her work saw it and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives. But later, Heather started writing again about her family and became very popular. She learned to share carefully.
The internet lets us say anything, but we should be careful about what we share.'"
2,C2,"'Some scientists talked about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? This movie mixes documentary and drama. It says there is a lot about our universe we do not understand. Some scientists did not like the movie. They said it was bad and dangerous. In the movie, scientists say the universe is stranger than we think. The movie talks about water changing because of thoughts. It shows pictures of ice crystals looking nice after happy thoughts and bad after sad thoughts. Some people believe this, but many scientists do not. They want more proof. The movie says the universe is very strange. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and a force called 'dark energy'. Other discoveries are also amazing. Scientists found that our brain sees things a little late. They also found where modern humans came from. Some scientists think life on Earth is linked to the universe's design. Science is not finished. We still have a lot to learn. Some scientists are trying to find a Theory of Everything to explain the universe. Many people think the universe is incredible.'"
3,C2,"'I like writing short stories more than writing novels. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, and writing a short story is like planting a garden. I do both, and they help each other. When I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. When I finish short stories, I want to write a novel. I never do both at the same time. I started writing short stories in 1984. It was hard at first, but I enjoyed it. One of my first short stories was ‘Breaking Waves’. It was in my first short-story book, Tales from Abroad. Short stories are quick to write. It takes me about a week to write one. Novels take a year or two. Short stories can come from small ideas, like a word or an image. If a short story is not good, it is okay. Not all stories are great. I learn from my short stories to write better novels. Short stories are like small shadows I leave in the world. They are special to me, and I like to share them with my readers.'"
4,C2,"'Science is very important. It helps us in many ways. Science can make us healthy, but it can also be dangerous. Science tries to understand small things like ants and big things like the universe. Science changes a lot. Scientists often find new ideas. Sometimes, these new ideas change what we believe. Long ago, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Now, we know more. Scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein helped us learn new things. Science is not always easy to understand. It is important for everyone to know about science. Science can change our world. It can help us, but we must be careful. Science is part of our future.'"
5,C2,"'Around 2015, big book companies saw that ebook sales stopped growing. Some even went down. This made people wonder if ebooks are good for the future. One book company worker said that ebooks made them forget how good paper books are. People still ask if ebooks will replace paper books. This question makes us think a lot. Why do we think ebooks and paper books are fighting? This is not new. When TV came, people thought radio would go away. But radio stayed. People listened in cars and at work. Long ago, people thought audiobooks would replace paper books. Many new things like movies, radio, and phones were said to end paper books. But paper books are still here. We like old things when new things come. When e-readers came, people liked old books more. They liked how they feel and smell. This shows that paper books will not go away soon. We like stories about change. They help us understand new things. We are excited about new things but also scared to lose old things.'"
6,C2,"'Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how famous people from the past 400 years did their best work. I wanted to know how they used their time each day to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, and worked. I wanted to show their habits and routines. 
The book is called Daily Rituals. It is about people's routines. A routine is something you do every day. It can help you use your time well. The psychologist William James said good habits can help us do more interesting things. But he was also a procrastinator and did not always follow a schedule.
I got the idea for this book one Sunday. I was at work, trying to write a story. But I was wasting time, cleaning my desk and making coffee. I am a 'morning person' and work best in the morning. That day, I looked online for other writers' schedules. I found many stories and thought someone should collect them. So, I started a blog called Daily Routines. Now, it is a book.
For the book, I collected many stories about people's routines. I used letters, diaries, and interviews. I also used biographies and articles. I thank all the writers and researchers who helped me. You can find all my sources in the Notes section for more reading.'"
7,C1,"'Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His father said they could not go on holiday to Spain because it was too expensive. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found a fossil on the beach. He knew he wanted to study fossils. At university, he decided he liked studying very old fossils. He did not want to study dinosaurs. He finished his studies and wanted a job. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London. On the day of the interview, the professor who liked another candidate had an accident and could not come. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, gave Howard the job. Howard was happy to get the job. He liked his work. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes. He was upset but went for coffee. There, he met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. The visitor told him about new fossils. Howard decided to go to Nairobi to study them. This was a big chance for him.'"
8,C1,"Charles Spence likes to eat many different foods. He is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. At home, he has ice cream made from bee larvae. It looks like bugs but tastes a bit like nuts and flowers. Spence studies how our senses work together to change how we taste food. He helps big food companies and famous restaurants with his research. 
Spence wrote a book called ""The Perfect Meal"" with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman. The book has many interesting facts about eating. For example, the first person to order food in a group usually enjoys their meal the most. Also, people eat more when they are with others.
Spence's lab in Oxford is simple. He uses old equipment to keep costs low. This way, he can work with chefs who cannot pay for research. His work is often paid for by big food companies. These companies want to reduce salt and sugar in their products without customers noticing. 
Spence met Heston Blumenthal, a famous chef, while working on a project. Together, they created a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"" that uses sound to change how food tastes. Spence found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. 
An airline will soon use music to change how food tastes for passengers. A brand also made an app that plays music while ice cream softens. At home, Spence has fun dinner parties with different sounds and lights to see how they change the taste of food."
9,C1,"'Our brains are very busy. We have a lot of information to look at, like facts and rumours. We have to decide what is important and what is not. We also do many things ourselves now. Before, travel agents helped us with flights, and salespeople helped us in shops. Now, we do these things on our own. We try to do many things at once, like work, family, hobbies, and watching TV. Our smartphones help us do this. But, doing many things at the same time is not good. Earl Miller, a scientist, says our brains are not good at multitasking. We switch from one thing to another very fast, and this is not good for our brains. It makes us less efficient. Multitasking can make us stressed and confused. It can also make us want more new things to look at. Our brains like new things, so it is easy to get distracted. Just having the chance to multitask can make us do worse. Glenn Wilson, a professor, says that trying to focus when you have an unread email can make you less smart. Russ Poldrack, another scientist, found that learning while multitasking puts information in the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV, the information goes to a part of the brain for skills, not facts. Without TV, it goes to a part of the brain for facts. Multitasking also means making many decisions, which is hard for our brains. Even small decisions can make us tired and lead to bad choices. Many people say email is a problem because there is too much of it. A scientist's son said his dad just answers emails all day, and the dad agreed. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and other things too.'"
10,C1,"'In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night to throw at people during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think about these questions. Animals did things, and science wrote down what they did. People did not think animals had feelings. But now, some scientists are looking at animal feelings. Books like ""Wild Justice"" and ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"" talk about this. There is a big question: do animals have feelings like people? In one study, cows opened a gate to get food. The cows that opened the gate by themselves were happier. They jumped and kicked. This makes people think about eating beef. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe says we should stop eating meat. He thinks this is a big change, like when slavery ended. Professor Aubrey Manning says we should think again about how smart animals are. He thinks animals have a simple mind. Professor Euan MacPhail says we should not think animals are like people. The big question is: can we know what it is like to be an animal? Balcombe talks about an experiment with birds called starlings. Some starlings lived in nice cages, others in bad cages. The birds in nice cages ate bad food when they had no choice. The birds in bad cages did not eat. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages were sad. He says one day we will think about animals like we think about racism now. Professor Manning agrees with him. He says people used to think animals were like us, then they changed their minds. Now, people are thinking about it again. It is a hard topic, and people have strong opinions.'"
11,C1,"'Thinking is how we understand what we read or hear. Adrian West, a teacher, says that arguing can help find the truth. Technology helps us store and use information, but it can also change how we solve problems. We see a lot of opinions and ideas that can confuse us. More information does not always mean better thinking. Reading books has gone down, and this might hurt our thinking skills. Patricia Greenfield, a teacher, says that watching videos and doing many things at once can make it hard to focus. We do not know exactly how technology affects thinking. Computers and games can be good or bad for thinking. Reading helps us think and imagine, but videos do not. Some videos help us process information quickly, but they do not give time to think deeply. Young people might not use their full abilities because of this. How we see technology affects how we think. Video games can be fun and also help us learn. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach us to make decisions and think in a real-world way. In the digital age, we need to understand how technology changes our thinking.'"
12,C1,"Matthew Crawford works as a motorcycle mechanic. Before this, he worked in an office but did not like it. He wrote a book about how working with your hands is good. His new book talks about how hard it is to focus today. He noticed this when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. Crawford thinks these ads make it hard for us to think. We are always interrupted, so we stop talking to people. We use phones and games a lot, which can take over our lives. Many people feel the same way. For example, some people complain about emails but still check them all the time. Phones on the table can distract us. We have many choices now, and it is hard to control ourselves. We send texts instead of talking to friends. Crawford says this is not good for society. He gives an example of a gym. Before, people shared music, but now everyone listens to their own music. This means people do not connect as much. Crawford has two ideas to help. First, we need less noise and distraction in public. Second, we should do things that need skill, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us focus on real things. They make us use our judgment and connect with others. This way, we can pay better attention to what matters."
13,C1,"""What do you do for work? This is a common question. We often talk about our jobs. I am a philosopher, so it is a bit hard to answer. Saying 'I am a philosopher' can sound strange. People might think philosophers know special things. But this is not true. Philosophers are like everyone else. 
Why do people think philosophers are different? One reason is that philosophers think a lot about life. A long time ago, a Greek philosopher named Aristotle said thinking about life is very good. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said we should think about our lives to make them better. 
Thinking about life does not mean reading many books. It means looking at our daily life and making sure it is good. It is important to share this thinking with others. But today, many philosophers work in universities and talk only to other philosophers. This makes it hard for people to understand them. 
I work in ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. I ask if things people do are good or bad. But philosophy is more than this. It helps us think about our actions and beliefs. By thinking, we can help everyone."""
14,C1,"'People who love food think about what and how we eat. In history, people talked about food to explain other ideas. For example, the Greek philosopher Epicurus talked about pleasure and pain. Today, his name is linked to enjoying food and drink. We see his name in restaurants and food shops. Food is social and cultural. It comes from history and we share it with others. We eat with friends and family. Food critics talk and write about food. They are good at describing tastes. Some people say food can be beautiful like art. But food is eaten, so it is different from art. There are questions about what we should eat, like organic or vegetarian food. These choices show our beliefs. Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. At home, we cook for love and friendship. In restaurants, chefs cook for work. Food can help people from different cultures come together. We can learn about others by eating their food. This helps us understand each other better.'"
15,C1,"'Rob Daviau is from the US. He makes special board games called ‘legacy’ games. When he was a child, he played many board games. But he thought they were not fun or hard enough. So, he wanted to change them. He asked, ""Can board games have a story? Can choices in one game change the next game?"" He changed a board game called Risk. He made a new game called Risk Legacy. In this game, choices change the game forever. Players might tear cards or write on the board. Sometimes, they open packets with new rules. The game is played over many sessions. Players remember past games and say, ""You did this!"" 
Daviau also worked on a legacy version of Pandemic. In this game, players try to stop diseases. His next game was SeaFall. SeaFall is about sailors exploring new lands. Making legacy games is hard. Designers must think about all player choices. They use testers to see how games work. Jaime Barriga tested SeaFall. He said, ""It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the game is good, then it breaks. Then you must fix it.""
Legacy games were not expected to be popular. Daviau thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved them. He said, ""Legacy games are exciting. You learn new things all the time."" Another fan, Ben Hogg, liked the adventure. He said, ""At first, I was worried about changing the board. But Pandemic Legacy changed my mind. It’s like watching a new movie.""
Legacy games are like TV shows. They have episodes. Daviau wanted to write for TV, but he became a game designer. He likes telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock said making a legacy game is like writing a book. You need to know the start and end. Daviau wants others to try new ideas. But he thinks gamers will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works on SeaFall, thinks legacy games change how we see board games.'"
16,C1,"'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online. People like stories about animals escaping, like rats and llamas, because they think animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells for protection. Some people think animals are not like humans, but Dr. Frans de Waal says animals are smarter than we think. He studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees. He says animals can think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand others. In the past, people thought animals were smart. Charles Darwin, who studied evolution, said animals and humans are not so different. But in the 20th century, people started to see animals as simple machines. Now, Dr. de Waal believes we are learning more about animal intelligence. He says animals have different skills. For example, squirrels can remember where they hide nuts. Inky’s story might not be true, but it helps people appreciate animal intelligence. Dr. de Waal did an experiment with monkeys. He found that monkeys can feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got upset. A video of this experiment showed people that animals have feelings too.'"
17,C1,"'Robots are machines that can do work. They are becoming more common in many jobs. In the past, robots were mostly in car factories. Now, they are in many places. Some people think robots will do most jobs in the future. But many people also think their own jobs are safe. This is not true. All jobs will change because of robots. For example, a robot in Australia can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This is much faster than humans. In the USA, a robot helps in supermarkets. It checks if goods are on the shelves. Robots cannot fix themselves yet. This means new jobs for people who can fix and program robots. But some people worry that robots will take away jobs that need people skills. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang studies robots and jobs. He says robots will work with people soon. Many companies will have a robot manager. There will be more jobs in robots, but not enough skilled workers. People need to learn new skills. Robots will also be in our homes. They will help us in new ways. This is a big chance for companies, but also a challenge. We need new rules to keep us safe. Many jobs might go away, so education is important. We need more people to study science and technology to be ready for the future.'"
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous climber, was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He said, ""Because it's there."" People often wonder why anyone would do something so dangerous. Some think climbing is about adventure and fun. A writer named Tejada-Flores wrote about climbing in 1967. He said there are different types of climbing, like climbing small rocks or big mountains. Each type has its own rules. Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. But sometimes, climbing can feel limiting, like when stuck in a tent during a storm. Joe Fitschen, a US climber, thinks climbing is in our nature. He says we like challenges, even if they are risky. Another writer, Brian Treanor, says climbing can teach us good qualities like courage and respect for nature. Some climbers believe that climbing without help or technology is more special. Ebert and Robinson, two expert climbers, think these climbs deserve more recognition. But this idea can be dangerous. Climbing can also be like meditation, helping people find peace. This is similar to Zen philosophy. These are some reasons why people like to climb."

But one day, a young boy named Kit Armstrong asked him for lessons. At first, Brendel said no. But then he heard Kit play. Kit played very well. Brendel decided to teach him. Kit is now 19 years old. He likes to learn new things like languages and math. He also writes music. Brendel thinks Kit is very talented. But Brendel does not want people to expect too much from Kit. Brendel is now 80 years old. He does not play piano in public anymore. But he still thinks about music.'"
20,B2,"'When I was little, I thought gardens were special places. My grandad's garden was by a river. You could hear the water and birds. I thought all gardens were like this – quiet and peaceful. Grandad's garden was simple. He didn't have a greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows. My dad was quiet at home. He liked to say, ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ which means ‘I don’t mind.’ He left school and became a plumber. He didn’t love plumbing. He and Mum once thought about moving to Canada, but they didn’t. Dad was good at fixing things at home. My parents moved house only once. But Mum liked to change furniture. One day, we got a piano. I was scared of it, but I liked the brass candlesticks on it. Mum took them away. My sister got piano lessons, not me. Mum said I wouldn’t have practiced. I liked the river best. I would go there with a fishing net and sandals. I looked for fish to catch and take home. But they didn’t live long, so I put them back in the river. I wanted to leave school early. One day, Dad said there was a job for an apprentice gardener. He thought I might like it. Dad didn’t like gardening, but he saw I did. I think he hoped it would be good for me.'"

The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It rains a lot there.’ I see the rain on the mountains. Lawrence says, ‘I have sheep to move.’ We walk down the hill. He tells me about the island. It is three km long and half as wide. The MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Lawrence has a sheepdog named Tie. Tie is not doing a good job with the sheep. Lawrence says, ‘Tie, that will never do.’ The Isle of Muck is run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son, Colin, manages the cottages. Their daughter, Mary, and her husband, Toby, run the hotel. Mary and Toby’s children play on the island. They come home when they are hungry. The island has electricity only sometimes. I wait for the lights to turn on. In the morning, Mary makes breakfast with a torch. There is no mobile phone service. Mary says, ‘There is mobile reception on the hill.’ I put my phone away. The boat brings groceries and musicians. They play music in the tearoom. Everyone enjoys it. Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on the Isle of Soay. Jenny went to manage it. She had good typing skills. It rains a lot on the island. I eat fresh fish from the island. Mary cooks it for dinner. The next day, I wait for the ferry. Many ferries were cancelled because of high seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. I secretly hope to stay.'"
22,B2,"'The video game industry is growing. It used to be seen as just a hobby, but now it is serious work. Making video games is hard. It needs many people and a lot of time. Jim Donelly, who works for a games magazine, says it is hard to get a job in big companies. But the industry needs more game designers. Not just the bosses, but also people who make parts of the game. Jim says the best way to get into the industry is to make games. You need to show what you can do. John Field, another expert, says it is not easy. Many people want to work in games, but not everyone has the skills. A good course in games can help. Most game designers start as programmers or artists. They like all kinds of entertainment and art. They are not just fans; they are interested in the future of games. Connections with people in the industry can also help. Games are not just for kids anymore. Families play together, and there are many games on phones and social media. John thinks there are many chances to grow in this industry. Games are fun and can also teach us things.'"

I am happy my dad was not like that. People say my goals are lucky, but I practice a lot. The best players practice for many years. I teach kids to enjoy learning football skills. At school, I played many sports like baseball and basketball. I know education is important, but I only thought about football. I want my son to learn and read. We read him books, but he likes to kick them. When I started playing professional football, the manager helped us young players. He did not make a big deal about it. We knew we had to work hard. We lost the first game, and a TV presenter said we could not win with young players. This made us work harder. I have a lot of money, but it can cause problems. People ask why my mom still works. I help my parents with money, but they like to work. My mom is a hairdresser and loves her job. I like to help my family with my money. After I stop playing football, I want to take a break and do things like skiing. I cannot ski now because if I get hurt, I cannot play football.'"

Reef Point was quiet in the summer because of sea fogs. The road was not nice, and most people went to La Carmella instead. Only people with no money or who loved surfing came to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, many people came. My dad was busy writing a script and didn’t notice me much. I went to the beach with my dog, Rusty. We didn’t have a dog at first, but Rusty came to us. I gave him water, and he stayed. My dad said, ‘He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and brought me things he found. Sometimes he brought things that weren’t his, like a sneaker or towel, and I had to give them back. Rusty liked to swim with me, even though I was faster. One day, my dad went to Los Angeles, and Rusty and I swam all afternoon. We watched surfers. One surfer was very good. She came over and said, ‘Hi, why didn’t you join us?’ I said, ‘I don’t have a surfboard.’ She asked if I was British and visiting. I said, ‘No, I live here. My dad came to write a film script.’ She asked his name. I said, ‘Rufus Marsh.’ She knew his book, Tall as the Morning, and was interested in me after that.'"

There was a problem with the computer system, and people were upset. Violet wanted to leave. She looked for her phone in her bag, but it was not there. She needed the phone to call the taxi company. Her son Harry always told her to be careful with her phone. Violet asked a couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at home. Violet was worried because she needed the phone numbers in New York. Finally, the line moved, and Violet got on the ship. She did not like the ship's foyer. It looked like a hotel that tried too hard. She went to the elevator, which was crowded. At last, she reached her room on the twelfth floor. She was happy because it had a balcony. She paid a lot to make sure she could see the sea."

Instead, he found 30,000 photos by Vivian Maier, a street photographer. Maloof now has many of Maier's things: her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives. He also has many movies and audiotapes. Maloof is excited about his find. He says, ""I had no idea what it was when I bought it."" Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier's life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and grew up in France. She came back to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always had a camera. She wore big coats, hats, and strong shoes. Maren Baylaender, who knew Maier, said she was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics. Maier loved theatre and movies. She was not very social but liked to take photos and talk to people. She was serious about her photography. Rydzon said, ""She was a true artist and did what she wanted."" Maier's photos are about women, children, old people, and the poor. Photography expert Larry Silverman finds her pictures interesting. He wonders if she had her own style or copied others. Maloof is still looking at all the negatives. He was not interested in photography before Maier's work. Her photos inspired him to take his own pictures. Maloof wants people to know Maier's name and work. He says, ""We want Vivian Maier in the history books."""

Jonny Kinkead is a man who makes guitars. When he was a boy, he liked to use tools in his dad's garage. He also liked to play the guitar. Now, for 40 years, he makes guitars by hand. Jonny says, ""I love the guitar. It is amazing how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound.""
Jonny learned to play the guitar when he was 11 years old. At 16, he wanted a bass guitar. Some people get a job to buy one, but Jonny made his own. He learned how different wood makes different sounds. Jonny and his brothers also made model boats and planes. Their father taught them how to use tools.
Jonny's bass guitar was good, but he did not think about making guitars for a job. He liked painting and sculpture too. After school, he studied architecture at university. But he left because he wanted to do something else. He thought making guitars is like sculpture because you make something people use.
Jonny started making guitars for a living. At first, he also cleaned windows to make money. He sold his first guitars for the cost of the materials. Now, he is known as a good guitar-maker, but he still makes only ten guitars a year.
In the beginning, Jonny went to music festivals to show his guitars. He learned how to price them. Today, it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK. People now know UK-made guitars are good. Jonny says new guitar-makers should take courses, but also learn by trying different things. He believes learning by doing is important."
29,B2,"English people often talk about the weather. This is a common way to start a conversation. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they find it interesting. But this is not true. The weather in England is not very exciting. There are no big storms or tornadoes. 
Some people, like Bill Bryson, say the English weather is boring. Others, like Jeremy Paxman, say it is interesting because it is always changing. But the real reason English people talk about the weather is different. Talking about the weather is a way for English people to start talking to each other. It is like saying ""Hello"" or ""How are you?"" 
There are three main times when English people talk about the weather: 
1. As a greeting, like saying ""Nice day, isn’t it?""
2. To start a conversation, like saying ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?""
3. When there is nothing else to talk about, to fill the silence.
So, English people are not really obsessed with the weather. They use weather talk to be friendly and to start conversations."
30,B2,"Alice Leader was in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was talking to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds. She told them the Romans built the wall 120 km long and 5 meters high 1900 years ago. The students chose this trip instead of going to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice did not have a good answer. She wanted a book to help explain, but she could not find one. So, she decided to write a book herself. Alice stopped teaching after 31 years and started writing in 2001. She said teaching is like acting and is hard work. Writing is exciting but not as tiring. Alice wants her books to be different from other children's books. She likes to teach English and History together. She loves when children go from bored to interested. Writing is like teaching for her. She started writing because her sons were leaving home, and her head teacher suggested a writing course. She wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. The course students liked her story and said she should publish it. Alice asked for a year off to write her first book. Her husband, Zachary Leader, helps her edit her books. He changes sentences and suggests new words. Alice likes to add more scenes. They work well together."
31,B2,"'To raise money for charity, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are brothers and champion triathletes, had a special race. The race was in the Yorkshire Dales in northern England. Jonny would drive a car on the road, and Alistair would ride a mountain bike across the country. Jonny said, ‘I’m excited! I can stay warm in the car.’ Alistair wore winter cycling clothes and said, ‘I’ve seen Jonny drive, so I might stop for tea!’ The race started at Semerwater lake and ended at Fleet Moss, a high road. Alistair had to go up a steep hill first. They shook hands and started. Alistair rode his bike up the hill, and Jonny drove the car. Jonny soon had a problem with a big tractor on the road. He said, ‘If Alistair wins, it’s because of this farmer!’ Alistair had to carry his bike up the hill. Sheep watched him. Then he went fast downhill. Jonny had trouble with narrow roads in the village. He drove slowly through a stream. Then he drove fast to the finish line. Alistair was also going fast to the finish. Alistair got there first. He asked, ‘Is Jonny here?’ The crowd said no. Alistair was happy. Jonny arrived later and said, ‘Well done.’ He was sad.'"
32,B2,"'When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the grass; you serve; you hit it and hear your own shot. The grass, the history, the stadium, the players in white, and the quiet crowd make you feel like you are in a different world. The quiet helps me play better. I try to think only about the game and the point I am playing. When a point is over, there is noise: clapping, cheering, people calling your name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching me. I am very focused. I know many people around the world are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final. It is the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me it was the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I told my friends I wanted to play there and win. Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer twice. In 2006, I was happy to be there, but Federer beat me easily. In 2007, I was very sad because I knew I could have played better. I cried a lot after losing. Toni, who is a tough coach, told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I told him he didn’t understand, that it was my last chance. I know a sports career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are very important, and I missed a big one in 2007. But Toni was right. I had another chance in 2008. I was sure I learned from my loss. I believed I would win. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends. We did not talk about the match. They knew I was already thinking about it in my mind. Until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone.'"
33,B2,"'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in April 1957. She loved Africa and stayed there for most of her life. Jane was a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, she became famous for her work with chimpanzees. She wrote books for children and adults. One of her books, ""In the Shadow of Man,"" is very popular and has been translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is a famous female scientist. She helped us understand chimpanzees better. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees eat meat or use tools. They also did not know that chimpanzees have emotions like humans. Jane Goodall's book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is very important for chimpanzee research. Her study of chimpanzees in Gombe, Nigeria, is a great scientific achievement. Even as a child, Jane was curious. When she was five years old, she wanted to know how hens lay eggs. She hid in a henhouse for five hours to find out. This curiosity helped her become a great biologist.'"
34,B2,"'Shirley Ford is a voice actor. She can speak like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. People know her voices from children's TV and cartoons. She also does voices for work programs about health and safety. Shirley says, ""I just did a voiceover about back injuries, so I had to learn many medical words.""
Shirley talks about voiceover work. ""Many actors think they can do funny voices, and they can,"" she says. ""But you need to make the script come alive for people who can't see you."" Many famous people want to do voiceovers, but they don't always get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.
After school, Shirley took a drama course. She sang jingles for TV ads. One day, a man at the recording studio asked her to try a rabbit voice for a cartoon. She thought it was funny but tried it and got a big part. Shirley found out she was good at voices and wanted to do more voiceover work. ""Things just happened for me,"" she says. ""In my second film, I played the main character and her brother and mother.""
Adult women often do voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter. It's hard to hire child actors, so companies prefer adults. Shirley learns new voices by watching children's TV. She likes doing cartoons the most, but she also does educational videos and ads. ""Ads are hard because you have to sound happy about things you don't care about,"" she says. ""I smile while talking to make my voice sound happy.""
The competition for voiceover work is tough. A good showreel, a recording of what you can do, is important. ""It's worth making a strong showreel,"" Shirley says. ""There are agencies that help with this."" She says she got to the top of her job by working hard and not giving up. ""You need to set goals and keep trying,"" she says.
For people who want to do voiceovers, Shirley suggests going to special workshops. She loves voices and becomes the characters she plays. ""If I do an American voice, I might talk like that for hours or days,"" she says. ""My kids are used to me talking in different voices.""'"
35,B2,"'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. Cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people choose other jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. It seems silly to think you can make money by drawing doodles, but some people do. Most cartoonists have wanted to do it for a long time. I loved comic strips as a child and drew for school papers. I studied graphic design in college. After college, I showed my drawings to companies. A newspaper wanted cartoons about local issues. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. Soon, I was making enough money. To be a cartoonist, you don’t need a degree or much money. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But it’s not easy. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent. The more skills you have, the better. I have done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer and designer. I take any job because you can learn a lot. It helps to be smart and curious. Cartooning is a business. You have to make and sell your work. Good business skills help. Some cartoonists are not great artists but do well because they are good at business. Some people worry about others stealing their ideas. To protect your work, draw a ‘c’ with a circle, write your name and the date. But it’s more likely no one will steal your work. If someone does and it becomes popular online, it can be a good thing!'"
36,B2,"'Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house. I decided to throw away an electric guitar. My dad gave it to me for my 16th birthday. It was black and made in Japan. I usually keep old things, so why did I want to throw it away? I took it to the rubbish dump. A young man saw me and asked, ""Are you throwing that away?"" I said yes. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. Later, I felt sad about it. A few months ago, I got an email. It was from a man named Keith Rushton. He said, ""I have your electric guitar."" The guitar was sold many times. Keith found my name on it and found me online. He wanted to sell it back to me. I was very happy. My dad put name stickers on everything, even my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar. But I switched to electric guitar. It was the time of punk music. When I got my guitar back, I remembered my birthday in 1978. My parents gave it to me. I played it again. It felt good. Now, I want to play in a band. My son plays the saxophone. Maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people like me. We could call our band ‘The Regainers’!'"
37,B2,"'People talk a lot about sleep now. I wrote a book called Insomniac about people who cannot sleep. Sleep is very important for our mind, body, and mood. People who cannot sleep know this well. It is good that sleep is getting attention. But what about dreams? We do not hear much about dreams. We lose dreams when we wake up early. The last part of sleep is called REM, and it is when we dream the most. A good sleeper spends a quarter of sleep time in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they spend six or seven years in REM. Dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM. Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, said dreams help us understand our mind. But it is not that simple. Now, dream study looks at the physical side of dreams. Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist, says there is not much agreement on dreams. Dreams help us think in new ways. P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams more than others. Creative people use dreams more. But everyone needs to think creatively, not just artists. Dreams help us find new ideas. Stickgold found that people are more original when they wake up from REM. Creativity is important for everyone. We need to think creatively in our daily lives. This is why we need to dream.'"

Some collectors pretend her copies are real. Susie signs her name on the back of her paintings. It is against the law to sell a copy as the real thing. Susie does not do this. She was an illustrator before becoming a copyist. She worked at a botanical garden. She learned to draw very accurately. Susie tells young artists to learn to draw well.

Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he will be very famous. Many young people play on computers and games. Jordan wants to show kids they can climb mountains too. Or just go outside. 
Jordan's team is his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero'. Climbing Everest is part of their big plan. If Jordan climbs Everest and another mountain in Antarctica, he will be the youngest to climb the Seven Summits. These are the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are 30 years old. Jordan has already climbed five of them. 
Some people think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say a young person might be strong, but maybe not ready in their mind. They also think a young person might not have enough experience. 
The Romeros know people say this. Paul says, 'I know people talk, but we have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we believe in our experience. Jordan is getting strong and grown-up.'
I wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it his father's idea? Paul says, 'This is not about me. Jordan wanted to do it later, but we thought: why not now? We talk to him to make sure he still wants to do it.'
When I ask Jordan why he likes the challenge, he says, 'I just want to reach my goal.'
Today, many people want to be the youngest or fastest to do something. They write about it online. Jordan has to do this too. He needs to blog, take photos, and give interviews. He needs to do something big, like climbing Everest.
Paul says, 'If Jordan wants to stop climbing and play basketball, we will stop and go to the gym.'"
41,B2,"'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they do not know him. I am studying music at university, but my classmates do not know much about classical music either. If you do not know the music, you probably do not have any recordings of it. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and classical CDs sell only about 300 copies each. This is surprising to me. Why do people not like classical music anymore? Older people say it is because of TV and video games, but I do not think so. Classical music is not very interesting to most people, especially teenagers. Teenagers buy most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who like classical music, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I am not a big fan of classical music. I like many types of music, but I listen to classical music only a little. Why do teenagers not like classical music? Classical music changes mood a lot, and teenagers like things fast. Experts say we cannot pay attention for more than three minutes, which is too short for classical music but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, and it talks about things teenagers care about. In the past, families played music together at home, and people went to concerts to hear music. Now, we can find any music online, but we do not often listen to classical music. You do not hear classical music in shops. One of my teachers says more people go to classical concerts now, but not many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play in many places, but the audience is mostly older people. Teenagers often do not like what their parents like. Some say schools are to blame, but many kids like to play classical music in school orchestras. They practice a lot, but when they relax, they listen to pop music.'"

Soon, her mom talked to the headmaster in his office. Bonnie waited outside. Then she stood up. ""Why should I sit here?"" she thought. ""I'll leave soon anyway,"" she thought.

I also have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow. I went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex,’ Mom said. I took a banana. ‘You’re up early. Be careful,’ she said. ‘Thanks, Mom,’ I said. I walked down the hall and almost bumped into Grandpa. ‘Watch where you’re going!’ he said. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ He knows I kayak every morning. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. I took a deep breath. He went into the bathroom. Mom smiled at me. ‘Don’t mind him,’ she said. ‘He’s not himself.’ I used to think Grandpa was a hero. He was in National Geographic magazine. His photos and medals are in his room. I don’t go there now. I have my own trophies. I want to be in National Geographic too. But I still care about him. ‘Have a good session, Rex,’ Mom said. ‘I admire your determination!’ I smiled. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my trip.’ She laughed.

Maybe if I tripped with Dad's knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet. I did not want to damage the carpet. I did not wake up and think, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small, white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran kept ornaments in it. I keep shells and stones there. I love the cabinet. But it is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It needs a corner. My bedroom has only two corners. My room is small, under the roof, and shaped like cheese. The big bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the back one is my sister Angela’s; the one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But Angela is only fifteen, so I will be in my small room for a long time. I like my room. It is cosy, like a nest. The roof slopes down, and the window is at floor level. The problem is, there are not enough corners! My bed is in one corner, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a bit too tall. I thought, if I cannot cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. Dad calls this lateral thinking. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box’. That is what I was doing!'"

I was asked to make a TV show of the book. It was hard because people love the book and have strong ideas about it. I used the book's drawings a lot. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' view, not humans'. This made filming hard. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans. So, we filmed from far away. The crew had to film from low down to see like the Borrowers. They wore out many jeans! We never lifted the cameras high, except for special shots. A big challenge was making the shadows look right. We made a special way to do this. After the show, a famous director, George Lucas, called to ask how we did it. We built the Borrowers' home under the floor with big objects to make actors look small. It was funny. The actors carried big things like giant scissors. The coins were bigger than plates and hard to lift. We often stopped filming because the crew laughed. In one scene, the Borrowers go down a drain. Actors went down a tunnel with water hoses. It was scary, so they didn’t have to act scared. Costumes were important. They were made from heavy cloth. The lead actress couldn’t bend or sit. She was sewn into her dress every day. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug. It was hot during filming, and the actors didn’t like the costumes. We filmed the actors in front of a blue screen. They had to act with things that were not there. I drew 2,000 pictures to show how scenes should look. We didn’t have much money, so I worked at night. Once, I filmed a scene with no film in the camera. But in the end, the show was good and showed the magic of the books.'"

50,B2,"'The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. This group has sent over fifty balloons high into the sky, about 35 km above the Earth. It is a science project and an adventure. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are going to release a balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal enters the Earth's atmosphere and makes a light. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are outside the lunch box to help find it later. A gas tank fills the balloon, which grows big like a small car. An older boy drove a long way to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time to let the balloon go. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they say, and the balloon goes up. Some of them run and watch it with flashlights. Then the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the clear sky. I see a boy get into a sleeping bag and sleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ says one girl. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, it gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box come back to Earth safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS. Finding it is not easy, but they like the challenge. The lunch box usually lands far from people. ‘Finding the lunch box is a big part of the fun,’ says the group’s leader. They have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. The team had to drive around the mountains to get it. They had to decide if driving or walking was better. It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was on a rock in a waterfall. The camera did not record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but they talked about why it happened. It was another adventure to share with others.'"

These games have gentle themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade. Everyone stays involved until the end. Some games are ‘co-operative’, where players win or lose together. Pandemic is a co-operative game made by Matt Leacock from North America. Players work together to solve problems. Leacock loved games as a child but was often disappointed. He and his uncle tried to make better games. Pandemic was very successful. It has a lot of storytelling, like video games. Video games helped board games become popular. Many people play games on their phones now. Video games and board games learn from each other. People used to play video games together in the same room. Now, many play online, away from each other. Some people want to play games with others in person again. John and Zuzi's café is busy because people like to play games together in real life.'"

55,B2,"'Tony Connor is a new kind of famous person. He is very popular online, but many people do not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist'. He jumps from places like roofs and walls on his bike. People film his jumps and put them online. I met Tony in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many local boys know him, and some older people call him a 'legend'. After watching him, I agree he is very brave and creative. Tony is famous online, but he does not like being a celebrity. He says, 'I find it hard to talk to fans. I like doing things more than talking about them.' Tony's fame comes from social media and cameras. He says, 'This technology helps me make a living.' But he also thinks people spend too much time with cameras and screens. Tony makes money from his videos, which used to be just a hobby. I learned that to be a top athlete, you need energy and the ability to keep going after failure. Tony shows this by trying again after falling. Some people think Tony takes too many risks. He says they do not understand his sport. Tony is careful and plans a lot. He says, 'I feel fear but find a way past it. I am not addicted to risk. I prepare a lot before trying a new jump. I must be brave when I jump.'"

Her latest challenge was walking on a high wire. The wire was 66 meters above the ground. It was between two towers of an empty power station. She had no safety net. She wore a belt attached to another wire above her. She carried a long stick to help her balance. The stick was eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert. She found high-wire walking very hard. She trained every day. She ran up a hill and did exercises. She learned how to fall on the wire safely. Falling hurt, but she stayed positive. On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen took deep breaths and walked slowly. It took 15 minutes to walk 150 meters. She said it was very scary. But she is planning her next charity project. She wants to go to the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"
57,B1,"'In 2006, Jeff Somers started a trip around the world on a penny farthing. A penny farthing is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Jeff had already written a book about traveling in Canada in an old car. He loved motor sports and worked on racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even went to Amsterdam on it for a holiday. ‘That trip made me want to see the world by bike,’ he says. Jeff didn’t want a normal bike. He wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bike I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two tries in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally started in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was seeing Mount Everest in Tibet. ‘I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which I couldn’t do, but I never regretted my penny farthing. The further I went, the more amazed people were by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in bed for ten days without medicine. He had no money for a hospital or to go home. But Jeff says, ‘if I could afford it, I would travel again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’'"
58,B1,"'I work at a university in the US. My team and I study water birds. We are learning about a bird called the American black duck. We use a special tool called a 'night-vision scope'. It helps us see ducks in the dark. We are worried because there are fewer black ducks now. We do not know if they have enough food on the east coast. We know what they do in the day, but not at night. The new scope gives us clear pictures at night. This helps us learn more and take care of their home. Our work is hard. Four people work six hours each day. We study ducks in different places. I take a boat to some places and write notes about the ducks. The weather is not always good. Some nights are nice, but many are wet. It is very quiet, so I drink coffee to stay awake. We only missed one day because of deep snow. I like the challenge. In summer, we will work in a lab to look at our results. It will be hard to stay inside, but it is important. I would not change my job for anything!'"
59,B1,"'When I tell people about my job, they are surprised. But it is true! I eat chocolate for my job. I taste chocolate to make sure it is good for customers. Every week, I get small pieces of chocolate from our factory. I check them for taste, feel, and smell. I also taste nuts and fruit we use in the chocolate. I choose the best ones. Next to my office, I have a kitchen. I test and taste chocolate there. I give my work friends some chocolate too! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients. It is nice to have my own space. Every day is different in this job. Sometimes I am in the food lab. Other times, I travel to buy nuts and fruit. I have a young family, so travel can be hard. But I like the change and not having a routine. I love my job, especially the chocolate! People ask if I get tired of chocolate. I have worked with chocolate for a long time, and I still like to eat it. I even eat more chocolate at home in the evening!'"
60,B1,"'Have you ever thought about working in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience. It is a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many things. You can learn to juggle, throw and catch balls, and even fire. You can also learn trapeze, which is flying in the air. Students take a year-long course. They slowly learn to take more risks. Parents can watch some classes. Sophia says, ""In the circus, you must do new things. You need to keep shows exciting. To be good in the circus, you must practice a lot. You also make friends and learn from them. Being fit is important. Circus artists train every day to stay strong. The best performers want to be better and have new ideas."" People think you might get hurt or work only a little each year. But you need to plan for the future because you can only work in the circus when you are young. The course also teaches business planning. Many students start businesses around the world. They like to share their stories. Sophia says it is not a job to make a lot of money. ""The work does not have a regular salary. It is competitive but very fun!""'"

Some people think backing singers are not good enough to be lead singers. That is not true. They have to be very good. People like Mariam are important in music! Mariam says, ‘I love my job because I never know what I will sing in the studio. It can be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Sometimes it is a funny song for a radio or an ad. Once, I had to sing like a fish underwater! But I never say no, I just do my job!’ ‘I need to be very good at music and learn fast. There is often no music to read. I remember my first time recording music for a film. It was hard because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared: if I made a mistake, we had to record everything again, and nobody likes that. Recording takes a long time.’ ‘One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. New songwriters do not always know what is best for a female voice. When they hear me sing their song, they can see how to make it better.’'"

Before choosing satchels, Julie thought about other businesses like cake decorating. Some people said satchels would not sell, but Julie believed in them. She worked with her mother, who is good at business. The bag design came from children's story books. Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her. At first, she sold one satchel a week. She sent satchels to fashion writers, and they wrote about them. Now, many people want her bags. Julie likes to see which celebrity has a satchel. She uses the internet for new ideas. One time, another company copied her design. Now, she trusts her team to make good bags. People say her office is a happy place.

She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie loved cycling. He bought a special bike and started racing. Vicky thought it looked fun and tried it too. She says it was the best choice she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing well. The track was near her school, so she could train after school every day. Vicky had a successful career in cycling and won many races. Then, at 28, she stopped racing. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning, but I got tired. When the fun stops, there’s no point.’ She started a new job. Vicky works for a charity called CycleZone. ‘We help young people who don’t like sport,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves. CycleZone is great because it brings young people together.’ The charity uses famous people to talk about their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people think celebrities only help to be more famous.

Ana first sang in front of people at school. She was very nervous, and her teacher helped her. The teacher told her to join the school theatre club. This helped Ana feel better about singing. Later, Ana's brother asked her to write a song for his band. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in three days. Ana liked writing songs, so she took a songwriting class. She was the youngest student, but she knew a lot about music. Ana wrote a song called Something to Say because she was upset with her teacher. She put the song online, and many people liked it. Joss Alton, who owns a music company, asked Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was not sure, but Joss said she could sing what she wanted. Ana then sang at a concert in Dublin. It was a great night. Ana likes to write songs about difficult times. One song, Decision, is about her brother stopping singing and feeling sad. Ana wants people to like her songs, but she writes about things that are important to her.'"

He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not. I wanted to visit the area because I saw it on TV when I was a child. Our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. I asked Harry if I could go too, and he said yes! Before we left, there were storms in the area. But the weather was good when we were there. I was busy at work, so I did not have much time to plan. But Harry said he took care of everything, so I stopped worrying. After we arrived in Canada, we joined the group. We packed our things into small boats and left. The guide said not many people live along that coast. We only saw dolphins and birds on the first morning. There were islands far away, but it was foggy, so we could not see them well. I watched the patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped to look at rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish. I did not know many of them. We did not worry about time. We made lunch and dinner together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it was relaxing! When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I missed my family and friends. I also wanted to tell everyone at home about our adventures!'"

I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, but I read books at the games. When I started secondary school, I was very tall. My sports teacher asked if I wanted to play basketball. I liked the practice, but I thought I needed more skills. The teacher believed in me. A few weeks later, I played my first game. My mum and dad watched, and I was nervous. But it was OK! For four years, I practiced every day and did well. I joined an adult team and moved to the USA for a sports school at fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic players. It was great to work with him. I missed my parents, but I got used to it. My English got better too! I became a professional player at eighteen. I was tall but needed to get stronger.

I took visitors around the city and I liked it a lot. I saw my city in a new way. After college, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide. I learned that I needed a licence. I had to know many things about Chicago, like its buildings, history, and transport. After some months, I got my tour guide licence. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You need to be fun and tell good stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want a good tour. If they are happy, they write good reviews online. Good reviews bring more customers. I work hard to make my tours fun and stress-free. My reviews are usually very good, and people recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago.'"

This place helps sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would like the other people there. They were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this. But, in the end, it was okay. Our job was to get food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants. This took most of the day. Josie thought it was hard work, but I liked seeing the elephants eat. We also washed the elephants in the river. We used big brushes and soap. I had fun, even if I got very wet! In the evening, we took the elephants to the forest. They stayed there at night. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom. It was small, but Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot at night, but we knew it would be. The food was very good. It did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, we talked and played games. Now, we are back in the UK. Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks, she says she loved it. I think she is a bit sad because she missed her friends. But she knows she was lucky to go. Maybe she will go back one day. I want to go back!'"
69,B1,"'Hello, I’m Gina D’Costa. I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many people. Some people buy flowers for friends or for their homes. Hotels and offices also buy flowers. Sometimes, we help with photos for businesses by giving them flowers. One time, I put flowers in a castle for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was happy with it. My day starts at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are sleeping then. My friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is cold and dark at that time, but I don’t mind. The flower market is great. There are flowers from all over the world. It is hard to choose. I like pink flowers the most, but I have to buy what customers want. Not all flowers are there all year. I don’t like talking about prices with sellers, but I have to do it. Flowers are not cheap, so I try to get a good price. At the shop, we look at what customers want and put flowers in vases. We make flower bunches and see how much they cost. Customers sometimes think flowers are too expensive. I ask them to choose again. I like to make nice flowers for the money they want to spend. I love my job and wouldn’t want any other!'"
70,B1,"'My city has a modern cinema. It shows new films and films for kids on weekends. It is near my home. But I wanted to talk about films with people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends. We do not use a cinema. We choose a new place in the city every month. Once, we used an old factory for a film about Antarctica. It was very cold, like in the film! Some places are free because they sell snacks. This helps us keep prices low. We do not want to make money, just cover costs. Each time we show a film, it gets easier. We have our own equipment now. We sell tickets online, so we know how many people are coming. It is nice when people say they had a great time. Our website helps us talk to other film clubs. We visit them, but we like our club best. We have a blog because people look online for film news. We also put posters in cafés. But the best way is when people tell their friends about us. People like our special activities, like a movie quiz last month.'"
71,B1,"'When I was a child, I loved taking photos. At 15, I wanted to do something special with my hobby. I decided to take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers did this, and I liked the idea. After some weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to show my photos to other people. I was happy when people liked my photos. I took photos of many things. Then, someone said my photos would be better if they had a common idea. I agreed and started taking photos of nature, like birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, not color like other young photographers. Sometimes, I was not sure about my project and almost stopped. But I trusted myself and felt better about my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photo competition for people my age. I entered my photos for fun. I was so happy when I won first prize. It was the first time I thought my photography was good. Now, I have my own photo studio and I am happy with my job.'"
72,B1,"'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn new skills like public speaking. In the NYC, you can do many activities and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced. Adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ help you. When you finish a level, you get a certificate. 
When I joined, my leader asked me to help at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure because I went to that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy and other children had their own friends, so I stopped going. But I wanted my first NYC certificate, so I tried it. Soon, I loved spending time at the club. It was more than just getting a certificate. 
After the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering because I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week and I really enjoy it. Because of this, I want to become a youth worker when I finish school in three years. A youth worker is someone who works with children. I never thought about this job before. 
This is my favorite part of the NYC. I have improved my communication skills and helped others. I have several NYC certificates now, and one is for camping!'"

The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to encourage me to try snowboarding. He loved snowboarding and wanted me to love it too. In the end, I did well. I started to love snowboarding and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people get bored of snowboarding, but I love it more as I get older. I like not having a fixed plan. Once, I got a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I was not sure I would try the jumps, but I did, and it made me trust myself more. In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I do not have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend time with my friends. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I need something else to do if I do not become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time for college. I cannot imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I cannot snowboard my whole life.'"

I saw my mum making necklaces. I asked if I could try. It was easier than I thought. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. I made jewellery and sold it to my friends and family. They said they liked it, but I was not sure. I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery. People from all over the country called to buy more.

Janine said, ‘My family moved a lot because of my dad’s job. I learned to make new friends. I know how it feels to be the new student in a class. This helped me write about Amelia, the main character, who goes to a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s life at home, especially with her older brother. I don’t have brothers or sisters, so I used my imagination for that.’ Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored. Her mom wanted to be a writer, and her teachers told her to write, so it was a good way for Janine to spend time. The year before, she won a short story competition on a website for young writers. When Janine finished Being Amelia, she sent it to a publishing company. They liked it, and a year later, the book was in stores. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover has happy teenagers, the story is about people with real problems. This makes readers believe in the characters. The reviewer says Janine is young, and her book is not very long, but she is a better writer than some other famous authors. Janine is still getting used to being famous. ‘At first, I hid when people saw me in the street, but now it’s OK. I want to help other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just spend time with my friends, and then I have something interesting to write about!’'"

He works for a group that takes care of old buildings. At first, we were not sure about moving. We thought the castle might not be as nice as our home. Also, there was no school on the island. But after we moved, we liked living on the island. Our apartment in the castle is nice. In summer, many people visit the island, and there are parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families on the island. There are not many teenagers here. The adults help each other with work on the island. I travel by boat every day to my old school. I like the big waves, but the boats do not go when it is stormy. If I miss the bus after school, I miss the last boat home. So, I tell my friends to hurry when they visit me. We see beautiful views, like the sunset over the sea. Sometimes it is foggy, then sunny again. We have storms, but the castle is strong. It has been here for a long time.'"
77,B1,"'I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds there. I watched them with my parents. They showed me how to see different birds. It was fun! After we came home, I joined a birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different birds. I have seen many birds on family holidays in other countries. We always look for places with birdwatching activities. I have been to Egypt and South America. I wanted to see my 200th bird in South America, but I didn’t. I learned to be patient. I made a video about my birdwatching. Many teenagers liked it. My teachers saw it and asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was nervous, but I did it. The teachers liked it. I might do it again next year! I am happy to live in the countryside. I know teenagers in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds in green areas. Birdwatching clubs should help more young people start this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, and it is not expensive.'"

My family thought I might stop playing, like with other hobbies. But I did not stop. I dreamed of playing football when I grew up. One day, I played in a local game, and a referee saw I was good. He told the manager of a professional women's club to watch me. She asked me to join her club. I was surprised because I did not know young girls could join. I started training with the club when I was 13. I got much better. Some people thought I might not be a star player, and that made me a bit sad. But my coach told me to believe in myself. He let me play in a big match. I ran very hard because I did not want to lose. By luck, I scored the winning goal. I heard my coach cheering, and after the match, my team carried me around. It was fantastic! Since then, I have scored many more goals. Next month, my coach and I will have a football tournament in my area. We want teenagers to like football and talk to other players. They can see what it is like to play for a top team. My advice to them is the same as my coach's advice to me – there will be good times and bad times. I have had very few bad times, so I am lucky!'"

In the UK and other countries, schools and universities want students to start doing research early. Research is not just for famous scientists or big universities. Everyone can do research. Research helps us learn and think better. It is good for school and jobs.
When you do research, you ask questions like ""Why?"" ""How?"" ""What does this mean?"" You do not just listen and repeat. You make new ideas. Research can be big and important or small and everyday. For example, you do research when you plan a holiday, fix things, or buy something online.
In college, you need to ask questions and think about what you read or hear. In some places, people think you should not question teachers or books. But in the UK, US, and other places, it is good to ask questions. This is called critical thinking. It is important to think about what you learn and not just believe everything. You need to check if it makes sense and has proof."
80,C2,"'Cities are places where people think and create. In the past, people in London talked about science and politics in coffee houses. In Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafés. But living in a city is not easy. In London, people got sick in the same coffee houses. Picasso moved to the countryside. Cities are full of ideas, but they can be hard to live in. Scientists study how cities affect our brains. They find that cities can make us tired and think less clearly. One reason is that cities have little nature. Nature is good for our brains. For example, hospital patients get better faster when they see trees. Nature gives our brains a break. Today, most people live in cities, not in open spaces. We live close to many people and this can change how we think and feel. In a busy city, our brains work hard to pay attention to many things, like people and traffic. This makes us tired. Nature is different. It helps our brains relax. This idea is called attention restoration theory. It says nature helps our brains rest. Parks in cities, like Central Park in New York, help people escape city life. A walk in a park can make our brains work better. People try many things to think better, but nature is very helpful. Even with city problems, cities grow because they help people create new ideas. Busy streets and many people help with new ideas. Cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are good for technology because of this. Less busy cities may have fewer new ideas. We need to find ways to keep city benefits and reduce city problems. Sometimes, people want to leave nature and go to the city.'"
81,C2,"'Where is the mind? We think the mind is in our heads. We have machines that show this. But maybe the mind is not just in the head. Things like stones, tools, and writing help us think. These things are important for the mind. A new idea, called Material Engagement Theory (MET), says the mind is more than the brain. MET looks at how things help us think. For example, a blind person uses a stick to feel. The stick becomes part of the body. This shows the mind can change with new tools. Humans use tools to learn and understand the world. This is different from animals. Humans make things, and these things change our minds. This is called metaplasticity. MET helps us see how things like tools and phones change how we think. Humans have used tools to change the mind for a long time.'"

People say photography is a big part of US art. To understand its impact, we look at its start in the mid-19th century. Why did people like photography? First, it was a new technology, like trains and electricity, that made the world feel smaller. Second, people used cameras to show who they were. Third, families used cameras to keep memories. Photos look real and show everyday life. A photo shows what the photographer wants us to see. Photos are records of people and things. They are made by a machine, so they seem real, but they also show the photographer's view. People think photos are a 'universal language,' but they can mean different things. To understand a photo, we need to know why it was taken and how people saw it. The same photo can mean different things at different times. Artists now use photos in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photos in his art. Photography is now an important part of art, like painting.'"
83,C1,"'In 1890, William James, an American thinker, said psychology is the 'science of mental life.' This means studying how we think and feel. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we know a little about this. Psychology looks at humans, but also animals like rats and monkeys. James was interested in human thoughts and feelings. He said we have a world around us and a way to know about it. This knowledge is personal. It comes from our own thoughts and feelings. Sometimes, we think we know why people do things, like feel sad or quit their jobs. But people can see things differently. Psychology helps us find out which ideas are true. Psychologists study the mind and brain, but they don't know everything about how the brain works. They learn by watching how people act. Psychology is like solving a puzzle. It uses clues from what we see. These clues are studied carefully. Psychology wants to describe, understand, and help change how we think and act. It helps in many areas, like teaching kids to read or helping people talk about their feelings. People have talked about psychology for a long time, but it became a science about 150 years ago. Early psychologists looked at their own thoughts to learn. But this has limits. Now, psychologists watch how people behave to learn more.'"
84,C1,"'In a storehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. You can find things like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry is the person who takes care of the museum. She thinks each product has a sad story. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who worked in marketing, wanted to collect new products. He started in the 1960s. He did not know that most products fail. So, he ended up with many products that did not sell well. People often think things will go well, even if they do not. This is called optimism. Some people believe that if you think positively, good things will happen. But research shows that thinking too positively can make people less motivated. Psychologist Carol Dweck says that how we see failure depends on our beliefs. Some people think ability is natural, while others think it can grow with hard work. People who believe in hard work see failure as a chance to learn and get better.'"
85,C1,"'Sports teams often play better at home. But why? People have different ideas. Science and money are two reasons to think about. Scientists study how players do their best. Money people wonder if home games matter. Fans think their support helps the team. When fans cheer, they remember goals. But they forget when cheering did not help. 
One study showed that referees make fewer calls against the home team when they hear the crowd. This is because they want to avoid stress from the crowd. 
Home advantage is less now than before. In the 1890s, home teams won 70% of games. Now, they win 60%. Travel is easier now, and stadiums are similar. 
Different sports have different home advantages. Basketball has a big home advantage, but baseball does not. Basketball needs teamwork, which is better at home. 
Another reason for home advantage is players feel more confident at home. Their testosterone levels are higher before home games. This might be because they want to protect their home. 
In the Rugby World Cup, home teams sometimes won against stronger teams. They used strong effort and did not give up. This shows home advantage.'"
86,C1,"""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous in sports. It means: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ People talk about whether talent is something you are born with or something you learn. Many think practice is more important than talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said you need 10,000 hours of practice to be an expert. Books like Outliers and Talent Is Overrated agree with this idea. But David Epstein, in his book, says it is not always true. He looks at why some people are very good at what they do. He travels to many places to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that sled dogs' success might be because of their genes and their desire to run. Epstein says both nature (genes) and nurture (practice) are important. He thinks if Usain Bolt grew up in the US, he might have played basketball instead of running. Epstein also talks about race and gender in sports. He asks why men and women compete separately if practice is all that matters. This shows the topic is complex."""
87,C1,"'A new report says many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children today feel this way. In her book, Kith, she says children stay inside too much, watching TV or using computers. They do not play outside in nature. This is a big problem, she thinks. Many children say they would be happier if they could play outside more. People over 40 remember their childhoods. They played outside, swam in ponds, and built dens. They think this was better and healthier. But these adults now keep their children inside because they worry about safety. Griffiths talks about how parents' fears help toy companies sell more gadgets. She also talks about giving medicine to active children and making them wear goggles for games. Griffiths is upset about these things. She believes children should have freedom to explore and take risks. She says children need small accidents to learn. But she does not say how to make sure accidents are small. Also, not all children want to play outside. Some are quiet and like to stay home. Maybe the real problem is making all children do the same thing.'"
88,C1,"'I am a scientist. I study how the brain works. I went to school for a long time. I am good at solving problems, but not because of school. Most problems need life experience, not school answers. For children, life experience comes from play. I study how play helps children grow. All young animals play, including humans. Animals that need to learn more, play more. For example, animals that hunt play more than animals that eat plants. Children play more than other young animals. Play helps children learn important skills. These skills are not taught in school. They learn to think creatively, work with others, and control their feelings. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can solve new problems. Creative people think like children. Albert Einstein said school almost stopped his love for math and science. He called his work 'play'. We cannot teach creativity, but school can stop it. School often focuses on one right answer. More important than creativity is getting along with others. Children learn this by playing with other children. Play is free and fair. School has become harder. There is less playtime and more homework. Adults control sports and play. This change happened slowly. Parents are more worried. They think children learn more from adults. But children need more play, not more school. We must let children play and explore. This helps them grow strong for the future.'"
89,C1,"'In many countries, young people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them talk directly to employers. In the past, people had to do things like stand outside an office with a sign saying 'hire me' to get noticed. But using social media can also lead to mistakes. For example, a young person in the US asked a marketing executive on LinkedIn to share her contacts. She was upset and said no, sending a mean reply that many people saw online. This story shows that using social media for jobs can be tricky. Many young people use Facebook and Twitter for fun, but using them for work is different. Employers say young people can seem too confident and rude online. This can make it hard for them to get jobs, even if they have the right skills. To contact someone on LinkedIn, you should say who you are and offer to help them. Do not send the same message to many people, and be polite. Social media can help you find jobs, but you need to use it carefully.'"
90,C1,"'It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Many people think newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, fewer people in the UK buy newspapers. In the USA, only 26% of people get news from newspapers now, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people say newspapers will disappear in 15 years. But old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here. Theatre, radio, and cinema have all survived new media like TV and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again. Newspapers were once new too. They became popular in the 19th century with new technology like the steam press and telegraph. People started wanting regular news updates. In the past, people did not expect change. They only noticed seasons and big events like floods or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. Before that, people did not need news every day. Newspapers have limits. Online news is different. People can choose what news they want and get updates quickly. Mistakes can be fixed fast. Online news has no space limits. But online news often focuses on being first and getting comments, not on understanding. In the past, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand our world better.'"
91,C1,"'Humans are not like animals that see well at night. We need sunlight to see. Our eyes are made for the day. But we have changed the night by adding lights everywhere. This is called light pollution. Light pollution happens when lights shine up into the sky instead of down to the ground. This makes the night too bright and affects animals and people. For example, birds can get confused by bright lights and fly into buildings. Some birds sing at night because of the lights. Light pollution also makes it hard for us to see the stars. We need darkness to sleep well and stay healthy. Too much light can make us feel bad. Long ago, people used candles and lanterns. Cities were not bright like today. Now, we have so many lights that we cannot see the stars. This makes us forget our place in the universe. We need to remember the night and the stars to understand our world better.'"
92,C1,"'The boss of a big company said his workers can take as much holiday as they want. He got the idea from another company. His daughter sent him an email about it. The big company has 50,000 workers and does many things like finance, transport, and healthcare. The other company has 2,000 workers and does one thing. The boss said workers can take holiday if their work is done and it won't hurt the company. But is this possible? When you come back from holiday, there is always more work. Workers might feel bad about taking holiday. This can make them stressed and less productive. People might also feel pressure from others about how much holiday they take. In some companies, people work late and might not take holiday even if they can. If workers don't have a set amount of holiday, they might not take any. Technology makes it hard to know when work stops and free time starts. Workers need rest for their health. The idea of unlimited holiday might not really help workers.'"
93,C1,"'Journal-based peer review is when experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This helps make sure the research is good. It can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Is this wait worth it? Yes and no. Science publishing is changing. Preprints are part of this change. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before review. They help share new ideas quickly. Publishing in journals is often about fame and career growth. This can lead to problems. Reviewers sometimes focus on if a paper is good for the journal, not just if it is good. Preprints can help because they let everyone see and talk about the paper. Some people worry that preprints might lead to bad science, but this has not happened. Preprints let authors get feedback from many people. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, says preprints helped her share her work and get feedback. Preprints let scientists talk about their work with many people. They also help share results that journals might ignore. Preprints make papers more visible and read by more people. This helps focus on the work, not just where it is published.'"
94,C1,"'I ask my students, ""What is a poem?"" They often say, ""A painting in words."" I am not happy with this answer. One day, I asked them to pick an object. They wrote one paragraph about it like a scientist. Then, they wrote another paragraph from the object's view, called ""Poem."" A student wrote: Poem I may look strange, but I help people breathe. I am used in emergencies for a short time. Most people never use me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class see how poetry is special. We had fun and talked a lot. In school, poetry was hard for me. Poems seemed like puzzles. After school, many people read fewer poems. Sometimes, you see a poem. It is not like normal writing. You try to read it, but it can be confusing. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we want from poems? Deep feelings, nice images, or funny words? Maybe. But for tears, we watch movies. For news, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings are nice to look at, and music is special. But poems can be unclear, like life. This does not tell us what a poem is. Online, a poem is ""a form of art with language beauty."" But the word ""poem"" comes from Greek, meaning ""a thing made."" Poets make things. What kind of thing is a poem? Some say poems are like wild animals or machines. But these ideas are not perfect. Talking about poems helps us think in new ways. Poems can change how we see things. Like songs, poems can stay in our minds. Words can be strong, like ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me."" But words can hurt. A poem in a newspaper or magazine can be powerful. It uses space that could be for something else. A poem is made by writing and rewriting, like stories or articles. But it is not made to sell. Poems are special. They can surprise us.'"
95,B2,"I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money. My wife, Marion, was happy when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. I like finding old things like brooches and coins. They make me feel connected to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 
One rainy February afternoon, I went to a place with old farming tools. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug in the mud and found a round, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, but it was a beautiful gold and silver necklace called a torc. It looked like the Great Torc in the British Museum, from over 2,000 years ago.
I took it home and showed Marion. We didn't try it on because it was too special. I hid it in our house because I was worried. The law says I had to tell the authorities in 14 days. I showed it to a friend in the hospital and then took it to the council office. The torc was real and sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum. I got £350,000, shared with the field's owner. 
People ask if I will stop using my metal detector now. But I still enjoy finding brooches and coins. Like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I keep looking for more."
96,B2,"'I love sleeping when I travel, but I don't talk about it much. My friends plan busy trips with museums and hikes. I smile and listen. They don't know I plan time for naps and lazy mornings. When I went to Mexico, I slept a lot, more than 12 hours some days. The birds were noisy, but I still slept well. Far from home, I sleep deeply and have nice dreams. Without alarms and work, sleep is easy. I think sleep is part of travel. We see and hear new things when we travel. Sleep helps us think about these new things. In Trinidad, people wake up early because of the heat. They rest at 10 a.m. and are active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is close to New York, it takes me time to get used to their sleep pattern. When I do, I feel like I am really there. In Santo Domingo, I had a big lunch with friends. We all got sleepy and took naps. I learned about the siesta, a rest after lunch. Travel sleep is special. I remember the smells and sounds. Slow travel means enjoying everything, even sleep. Maybe I should tell my friends that sleep is part of travel too.'"

The woman made a face. ‘But it is boring,’ she said. ‘Everyone will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This one will make me different.’ She touched the small red and black hat on her head. ‘Yes, this is the one I want.’ Mia smiled and agreed. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was happy to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. Jen was bringing a friend named Tattie. ‘Tattie,’ Mia’s husband Jeff said, ‘What kind of name is that?’ ‘It’s short for Tatiana,’ Mia said. ‘I think it’s nice.’ Jeff did not like fancy things. He would have told the woman in the shop that she chose the wrong hat. ‘You are too polite, Mia,’ he often said. Later, Mia closed her shop and went home. Her shop was next to her house. Four years ago, when Luke left home, Mia started her hat business. Jeff was not sure it would work. ‘Do people want hats?’ he asked. Mia knew they did. Her business, Mia’s Hats, was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. They tried on many hats to find the right one. Mia also sold handbags and jewelry.'"

I saw mountains, streams, and forests. My neighbor woke up. He smiled and said, ‘Good morning, Robert’ in a Russian accent. Sergei was from Moscow. He was going to sell safety clothes to miners. His English was not good, and my Russian was not good. We used a dictionary to talk. I told him I was going to Magadan in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket. I wanted to go back to England by bicycle. Sergei said, ‘But, Robert, there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.’ I said I thought there was a road. ‘Alone?’ he asked. ‘No, with a friend called Al.’ ‘Just one friend?’ ‘Yes, just one,’ I said. Sergei looked worried. He said ‘Holodna’ (cold) and pointed outside. I told him I had warm clothes. I did not say my clothes were cheap. I was not sure they were good. My big trousers cost £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students. Some were taking notes. The lecturer talked. I was thinking. Should I ask him or not? I wrote a note: ‘Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.’ Al was in front of me. I gave him the note. He read it, wrote something, and gave it back. It said ‘OK’. Six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I was a geography teacher. The job was hard but good. I had long holidays to have adventures. Twice I went to meet Al. He liked adventures after our bike ride in Pakistan. He wanted to cycle around the world. This was his biggest adventure.

I learned to look at the horizon to stay calm. The pilot told me to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. Before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started, I was nervous. I tried not to touch the pedals or switches. The pilot, Dario, and I were in a fast plane. We took off and turned right quickly. I felt the air push on me. I looked at the horizon and tried to stay calm. We flew close to the ground and between pylons. I was excited but also scared. I flew the plane for two minutes. My hand shook a lot. Then Dario did a barrel roll and a loop. I was upside down and heard, ‘Relax, look up.’ I saw fields. The flight was 10 minutes long. It was easier than a real race. Dario ate a sandwich after we landed. I did not eat for hours. That night, I dreamed of flying in loops.'"

But I also thought about rowing across the Atlantic with TV presenter Ben Fogle. I love rowing. I talked to my friends about the race, but they were not interested. I knew if I joined, I would want to win. Ben already had some money for the race. The boat and equipment cost a lot, £70,000. I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business events is good money for me. But I wanted a new goal. Rowing the Atlantic would be a new challenge. I learned a lot while planning. Being an athlete was hard, but simple. I was worried people would think I just wanted to be on TV. But the race is more about the mind. Ben had done hard things before, but he could not row well. I was surprised.

I found a small company run by Anna and her husband, Pasi, in Finnish Lapland. They let me work as a husky dog handler for the winter. From December to February, tourists come for sled rides with huskies. The company started with six dogs and now has more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm’ with no running water. They said I could join for three months if I was ready for hard work. I started packing right away.

Anna asked if I was ready to start. I followed the barking dogs and saw people getting them ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited. I got into a sled, and we went into the dark with only a light on my head. November 15, Hetta I quickly learned to be a husky guide. Anna asked if I was useful. I didn’t know. I had never driven a snowmobile or chopped wood. But I had a driving license. Dog-sledding basics are easy: lean in corners, use the brake to stop, and don’t let go. But feeding the dogs is hard in the cold. Water freezes fast, so we make a 'soup’ for the dogs. After a week, I was tired but happy. I emailed friends, 'I can chop wood and use tools in the snow.’'"
105,B2,"'On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast and finished the race. The press was surprised by her amazing run. Her time was so good that she could run in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Reporters asked her about emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman told her about it. Radcliffe used it after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she did not really understand how big her achievement was. She and her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometres, Radcliffe's agent was worried she was running too fast. Hartmann was angry about this but understood why someone might think it was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe thought she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She ran the last part in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, was surprised by her time. Radcliffe wanted to run again next year, but it did not happen. People wondered how she ran so well with her awkward style. Hartmann helped her a lot. He worked with her every day because she ran 250-300 kilometres each week. He says she could handle a lot of pain. Hartmann traveled from Ireland to France to help her. Her husband would say, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ She worked very hard. Other athletes were upset because Hartmann spent so much time with her. Radcliffe does not know why no one has beaten her record. She trained hard but thinks others are more talented. She thought Mary Keitany might beat her record.

106,B2,"'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, started, I did not know if people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a food change in Britain. I thought our show was new and different, but I was still worried. Would people like cooking with history, memories, and science? I watched the first show feeling happy and scared. I did not need to worry. The show was a success and led to other projects, like a book about my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey into the past, the mind, or cooking. I wrote books called ‘Perfection’ with TV shows. In these, I traveled a lot with passports and suitcases. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest book. In it, you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes special pasta. These people work for many years to make perfect things. Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing dishes for the show was hard. I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But we made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on feelings, memories, and places. I knew the recipes were not the only way to make the dishes. But I used my skills and talked to food experts to find out what made the dishes special. The dictionary says ‘perfection’ means being perfect, but it also means improving by trying new things. The TV show let me see new foods, people, and places. I was excited to explore memory and nostalgia in food. I traveled the world to find the best ingredients. Some adventures were funny, like going to a factory with the wrong tomatoes or a farm that was not good enough. I learned new ways to cook, like milking a cow by hand, using dry ice for ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house for a pizza.'"

Later, we were in a truck with our van behind us. John drove the van. Bea didn’t want to move, so John carried her to the truck. I thought about how we’d get home. Maybe we could take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep.'"
108,B2,"'Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel. She talked to two other pianists. One was a man from Tokyo, and the other was a woman from Europe. Lucy didn't hear the woman's name clearly. They were both older than Lucy, about ten years older. They spoke English well. They talked about the music they played and places they visited. Lucy said, ‘I think I'm going to Tanglewood this summer.’ It sounded impressive. But Lucy didn't really want to go. She didn't want to do many things, like concerts and competitions. These made her miss a lot of school. She studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco instead. Lucy didn't even want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen pianists her age were chosen from around the world. Lucy's dad bought her a necklace to say well done. Her brother Gus dreamed of going to the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her to dinner to plan music. Lucy's mom sent the application for the festival. Lucy didn't apply herself. Her mom said, ‘I didn't want you to be sad if you didn't get in.’ Lucy thought her mom didn't want her to say no. Lucy used to think saying no was bad. The man from Tokyo asked, ‘Tanglewood?’ Lucy said, ‘Yeah.’ He asked, ‘How old are you?’ Lucy said, ‘Fifteen.’ The woman said, ‘Wow.’ Lucy didn't want to show off. She just wanted to fit in. The woman left to talk to someone else. The man asked Lucy if she had been to Japan. Lucy said, ‘Once, when I was eight.’ Then Lucy's grandfather came. He said, ‘Lucy, meet someone.’ He took her away. He said, ‘Don't get too friendly with the competition.’ Lucy said, ‘They're not the competition.’ Her grandfather said, ‘Everyone is the competition.’ He made her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded. She didn't hear everything. In the elevator, her grandfather said, ‘You did well, Lucy. I'm proud of you. This festival is important. People know who you are.’ Lucy liked being somebody. Even if some people were jealous. At school, being a pianist didn't matter. Her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care about her music. But at the festival, Lucy felt important.'"
109,B2,"""‘You spend too much time online. You need to go outside,’ said Dad. I wanted to know what experts say about this. They say that teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends and learn important skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers live in it, not just use it like adults. Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says social media is like a virtual youth club. It helps teenagers find out who they are and deal with teenage problems. Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says social media helps teenagers learn about themselves. They can share their favorite music or sports and see different opinions. Social media can also help shy people talk to others. Professor Andrew Phillips says social media helps people with special interests find friends. Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who create content online are using social media well. They make videos, podcasts, and blogs. Photo-sharing sites help photographers learn and share. This is good for jobs because businesses use social media to sell products. Teenagers who use social media creatively will do well in the future. Matthews agrees that working with others online is an important skill for jobs today."""
110,B2,"'My family went on a big trip. We traveled through nine states in the US and one part of Canada. My parents planned this trip for our summer vacation. My dad wanted us to spend time together. My brother and I were not sure about it. In June, we packed our car with bags and clothes. We started our trip, leaving our home. We drove through Oklahoma. We saw many stars at night. We also saw a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right to go first on the road. The next day, we woke up early and drove again. We saw deserts and mountains. We visited the Great Sand Dunes and Pagosa Springs in Colorado. We saw many things, like wind farms and Yellowstone National Park. We even saw a bear on the road! We stayed in an old hotel with no internet. But the views were beautiful. After Canada, we drove back home. My parents were right. We did not need to go far to see amazing things. I was happy to be home, and I did not fight with my brother. We took many photos to remember our trip. I will remember the fun and surprise moments.'"

112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger's teacher thought she might write a book. Charlotte wanted to try writing a book when she was 13. Now, her book is going to be published. Her teacher was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book when she was older. Charlotte did not want to wait. She is 15 years old now and her book is very good. It has a lot of action and does not seem like it was written by a teenager. Charlotte is smart and confident. She knows she is young and does not have all the answers. She wanted to ask big questions in her book. Charlotte thinks many books for teenagers show them in a bad way. She says there are three types of teenagers in books: the outsider, the naïve one, and the awkward one. She wants stories about teenagers who are okay. Charlotte likes reading fantasy books, but they almost stopped her from writing. She thought she had to write like them to be good. A book called ""How Not to Write a Novel"" helped her. It says if the reader knows what will happen, the story is not exciting. Charlotte's parents are journalists, and this helped her get her book read. Her father knew someone in publishing. She knows she was lucky, but she also knows writers need talent to succeed."
113,B2,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked at the ski slope. ‘Who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who knew some ski-jumping, went first. He went fast and jumped, but something was wrong. We watched. He fell and lost his skis. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is tricky.’ Maybe I was not good at this freestyle skiing. Before, I liked skiing and turning in the snow. I was not like the teenagers who did tricks in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I did not know how to do it. My parents took us on a winter holiday to a freestyle skiing school in the US. It had a big indoor place with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes. After practice inside, students went outside to try for real. ‘You will get better!’ the school said. ‘Before, people just tried and hoped,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land wrong, it will hurt.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part before the slope goes down again. Land in the right place, and you keep moving. Land on the flat, and it hurts. So, you need speed. At first, I was scared to go fast. My legs slowed down, and I landed wrong. I did not fall, but I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump,’ said Gareth. Day two was on trampolines. I thought I would not like it, but it was fun. We learned moves for ski-jumping and ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth talked to us. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work. I only knew when I took off and when I landed in the foam. We went back to the mountain. I had problems, but I finally landed right. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But it did not last. On the last run, I went fast, jumped, and landed right. Then I saw my skis going down the slope without me."""
114,B2,"""Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at a fun park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight. The ride stops, and then it goes up slowly. You wait. Then, it drops fast, and you feel your stomach in the air. You go left, right, and upside down. You scream because you are scared. But you wanted to go on the ride, like many people every year. Amusement parks are big business. They have many exciting rides. Many people work to make these rides, like engineers and designers. Making a rollercoaster is hard. It must be fun and safe. It also needs to be new and exciting. A long time ago, a man named John Miller made many rollercoaster ideas. Today, people use his ideas to make rides. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts said it is about making people feel excited but safe. Rollercoaster teams make stories for rides, like space adventures. They want the ride to be the tallest or have the most twists. Professor Walker said that experience and trying new things help make good rides. Jeff Hornick said you need to like thrills to make rollercoasters. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rides. Walker said it can add to the ride, but the real rollercoaster is still the most important part."""

Miranda likes to remember what it feels like to be a dancer. She says it can be hard and stressful. As a choreographer, she teaches young students. She likes working with them because they are open to new ideas. They want to succeed and listen to feedback. When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on dance steps and music. Sometimes she does not like the music, but she still tries to make a good dance. She cannot change the music because it is already chosen. Miranda works with many different theatres and schools. She likes meeting new people and learning new ways to work. She watched a documentary about ballet dancers. It showed how hard they work. Miranda thinks a great dance show has good music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. She does not want to be known for just one type of dance. She wants to try many things.'"
116,B1,"'A friend asked me why I travel when I can watch TV. I said you can see nice things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to do outside? This talk gave me an idea for a trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, and it became the star of the film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and used old seatbelts. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it every night, even on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and cheered me on. I have walked a lot before, but this was new. It was the longest I have walked, and I could stop at a café and relax with a coffee. I told people, ""No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon."" When someone at work asks about my weekend, I like to say I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England. You can see the film on my website.'"
117,B1,"'I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands. I was excited. I never tried group trips before. My brother, who I traveled with before, was busy. So, I decided to try a group holiday. At the Greek port, a man was curious when I asked for one ferry ticket. The islands are popular with families. I said I would join ten others to swim around the islands. He was still puzzled but smiled and showed me on board. Our group sent emails before the trip, but we didn't have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides said a support boat would be with us. They showed us how to talk to the boat. We did a short swim to make speed groups. Then, it was time for our first 1.5 km swim. I was nervous. I trained in my local pool and swam in a river, but never in the open sea. The waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers move ahead. I wanted to finish this first swim and was happy when I did it alone. The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to see the view. The swims got longer, and I got faster and happier. We didn't need the support boat much. I can't wait to come again next year.'"
118,B1,"'Being a flight attendant is not easy. But since I started, I have traveled a lot, from the US to Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. This is a good job for a young person like me! As a child, I went to a school in another country, away from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. I felt lonely, so I asked flight attendants if I could help give out meals. Some said yes. I remembered this when I wanted to leave my banking job and find something new. At the interview, there were many young people. Many got the job. They were like me, changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and past work. I got the job! I think this job is good for anyone. There are many good things about it. Free flights are not the best part. Airline staff work very hard. We say, ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It feels like a big family. We are close, even if we don’t see each other all the time. When I am not working, I don’t take work home. If I have difficult passengers, it is okay. The flight will end soon, and I will not see them again!'"
119,B1,"'I work at a summer camp. I like to see children do things they thought they couldn't do. Most children can swim and play table-tennis before they come here. But rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel scared, but we help them try. They all reach the top and feel happy. Some children miss home at the start of the week. It is usually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their phones all the time. We say they can call home after lunch. If they ask again after dinner, we say to call tomorrow. Most children feel okay after a few days. At the end of the week, they thank us for a good time. Sometimes, parents call a lot to ask about their child. This is not needed. The child is often busy playing games. We tell parents to call later. Some children come in new, expensive clothes. They argue when we ask them to change. But soon they understand why.'"

In the UK, young actors can do fewer shows each week. So, they needed more actors in London. The director found many good actors in the UK. They won their first ‘Best Musical’ award in London. The London theatre is bigger than the one in the USA. It is full every night. People want to hear the songs from America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘I get paid to play a beautiful guitar.’ Jamie and the other young actors have school lessons at the theatre. He misses his old school friends. His class came to see the show. The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. His class loved the show. Jamie’s parents come when they can, but tickets are expensive. I play guitar too. Jamie gave me a guitar to play with him and the other actors. We played a song called Days. Jamie helped me learn it. I was happy when I played it right. Jamie is very good at playing. The young actors are musicians. Some play many instruments. But they never played in a band before. They found it easy. The hard part was looking natural on stage. They forgot to smile at first! The show will be in London for another year. It is very good to see.'"
