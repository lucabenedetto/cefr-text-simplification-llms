1,C2,"'Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins – telling everyone online where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just saying, ‘Hey, I’m at this place,’ but you are also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This made people more aware that sharing everything online might have problems. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering possibilities like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize it can be dangerous and confusing. Is this sad? Maybe, but don't lose hope. There is a guide for this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored and found all the dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with fame before social media existed. These early users, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, we should learn from them. If we don't learn from history, we might repeat it. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ‘WWW’, which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at Cern, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people came to see a young man exploring this new medium. Hall shared everything: if you met him, you might appear on his site; no topic was off-limits. It was the work of someone who liked attention, but it was also artistic. One day, visitors to Hall’s site found it gone, replaced by a video called Dark Night. He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ‘either the blog goes, or I do’. He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you, you might be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to all the vice presidents at her company, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ‘online distribution effect’: the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn’t say in person. But the web is not a place where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives. If we forget this, we might make big mistakes. Armstrong’s story ended well. She was upset and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started her blog again, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ‘mommy blogger’ and her writing supports her family. She learned that just because we can say anything online, it doesn’t mean we should.'"
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film used a mix of documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.
At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists talked about how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being affected by thoughts. It showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy, and not nice after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing, but many scientists do not. They want more proof that thoughts can affect water.
The real problem is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is expanding because of a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" These discoveries are based on years of research. Other amazing discoveries include how our brains process events and the origins of modern humans. Some scientists even think there are links between life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Science is not finished. We are still far from knowing everything. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty show that there are limits to what we can know. Some physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. Despite these efforts, many people think the universe is best described in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"'For me, writing novels is a challenge, but writing short stories is a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both are important and create a complete picture that I love. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colors attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started writing, I have switched between writing novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories. After finishing short stories, I want to write a novel. I never mix the two. Writing novels and short stories might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch between them. I started my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I began writing short stories. I didn't know much about writing short stories then, so it was hard, but I found it memorable. My fictional world grew, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of short stories is they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to make a short story decent (though I revise a lot). It’s not like the long time it takes to write a novel. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That’s it. Writing a novel can feel like it takes forever, and I sometimes wonder if I’ll finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change. Another good thing about short stories is you can create them from small ideas, a word, or an image. It’s like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn’t work, you just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t always write masterpieces. This comforts me. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories. Short stories are like a test for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like soft shadows I have left in the world, small footprints I remember. They are like guideposts to my heart, and I am happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,C2,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also brought dangers. Science tries to understand small things like ants and atoms, and big things like the universe. It influences poets, politicians, and philosophers. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, and its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes think science is more or less important than it really is. Scientists often change or challenge old ideas, and new ideas can be mocked before they become accepted. Science is full of conflict and change. Scientists often disagree, and new discoveries can change our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Later, scientists like Newton and Einstein changed these ideas. Science keeps changing, and with each change, we understand nature better. In the past, scientists thought they knew everything, but then they discovered many new things like radioactivity and black holes. Today, some people think we are close to understanding everything about the universe. Science is not just for fun; it affects our lives and the world. We have become more than just observers of nature; we can control it a little. But sometimes, we change nature in ways we don't understand. It's important for everyone, not just scientists, to understand science because it affects our future and the world our children will live in. Science helps us plan for the future, and these plans can affect things like government budgets and health."
5,C2,"'Around 2015, after years of growth, big publishers said that ebook sales had stopped growing or even dropped. This made people question the future of ebooks in publishing. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, and his company lost faith in 'the power of the word on the page'. Even though digital and print books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will 'kill' print books. Whether predicting or dismissing this, the idea of books disappearing makes us think and debate. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see ebooks and print books as fighting, even if evidence says otherwise? These questions show our mixed feelings about new things and change. In my research, I found that people often think one new technology will replace another. Before digital tech, people thought new inventions would end old media. When TV was invented, some said radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn't new. In 1894, people thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This has happened many times. Movies, radio, TV, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some said losing books would harm culture, while others praised ebooks too much. The idea of books dying comes up during tech changes because it shows our hopes and fears about change. We form emotional bonds with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we connect with things like books and computers, even naming our cars or getting mad at our laptops. New tech, like e-readers, means economic and social change and makes us change our bond with familiar things. As tech changes, we miss what we used to have. This is why industries grow around old products. When the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. The move from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for silent films. The same happened with analog to digital photography and vinyl records to CDs. E-readers made people appreciate 'old' books and their smell. This should comfort those worried about print books disappearing. But the idea of disappearing media will keep being a story about tech's power and our fear of change. We use familiar stories, like tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the book's death shows our excitement for the future and fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves.'"
6,C2,"'Almost every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I wrote about how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years found time each day to do their best work. I looked at how they organized their schedules to be creative and productive. By writing about the simple details of their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I wanted to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to show them as people with habits, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.’ I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.’ In this way, my book is about the circumstances of creative work, not the work itself. It’s about how things are made, not what they mean. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever thought you couldn’t even type a business letter without showing something of your inner self. My book looks at questions I struggle with in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to focus completely on a project or to work on it a little each day? When there isn’t enough time for everything, do you have to give things up, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t pretend to answer these questions in my book – maybe some of them can’t be answered, or can only be solved individually. But I have tried to show examples of how different successful people have faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas can be broken down into small daily actions; how your working habits affect your work, and vice versa. The book’s title is Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary and automatic. But a good routine can help you use your time, willpower, and optimism well. A solid routine helps you focus your mental energy and avoid being controlled by your moods. The psychologist William James thought you should put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself was a procrastinator and couldn’t stick to a regular schedule. Interestingly, it was a moment of procrastination that led to this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was alone in the office of the small architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk, making coffee, and wasting time. I’m a ‘morning person’, able to focus in the early hours but not much use after lunch. That afternoon, to feel better about this, I started searching online for information about other writers’ working schedules. These were easy to find and very interesting. I thought someone should collect these stories in one place – so I started the Daily Routines blog that afternoon and, now, this book. The blog was casual; I just posted descriptions of people’s routines as I found them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and more. For the book, I’ve gathered a much larger and better-researched collection, while keeping the short and varied voices that made the blog appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, using quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I have summarized their routines from other sources. I should mention that this book wouldn’t have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I used. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also guide further reading.'"
7,C1,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, had a big mortgage and was worried about the economy. He said they could not go on holiday to Spain as planned. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. One day, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From then on, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of university, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was interested in the very early times, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied small creatures in grey rocks. When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about getting a job. He knew he was good, but he also knew that deserving people do not always get what they want. When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied, but he did not expect much. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help another candidate had an argument with his wife, crashed his car, and went to the hospital. The interview happened without him, and another professor, who did not like the first professor, made sure Howard got the job. Howard was surprised but happy. Later, he learned the truth but was not too upset. He was glad to have the job and do the work he loved. He often thought about how his work was organized, but life was unpredictable. One day, his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he went back to the college, called to postpone the lecture, and reported the theft. Then he had coffee with a colleague and a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils there, which would be his biggest challenge and secure his career. If not for the theft, he would not have known about it. He quickly changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi. 
*An ammonite is a type of fossil."
8,C1,"Charles Spence will eat almost anything. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. These larvae might look like maggots, but they have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create our perception of flavor. His research influences what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink, a field known as gastrophysics. They look at who we eat with, how food is arranged, the color and texture of plates, and background noise—all of which affect taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting insights. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant enjoys their food the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and low-tech. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less serious, but now it's considered important because it shows real-world impact. Spence is helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar, often without customers noticing. Research shows that if you tell people about these changes, they focus on the taste and might not like it as much. Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a big food producer. Together, they created the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish at Blumenthal's restaurant. Spence's research shows that higher-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with food served to passengers. Last year, a brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste. At home, Spence has had dinner parties with unusual themes, like eating rabbit with fur-wrapped cutlery or using colored lights. For Spence, home, shops, and food events are all extensions of his lab."
9,C1,"Our brains are busier than ever. We get a lot of information, some true and some not, and we have to decide what is important. We also do more things ourselves now. For example, we book our own flights and find things in shops without help. We try to manage our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and TV shows, often with the help of our smartphones. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. We actually switch quickly from one task to another, which makes us less efficient. Multitasking increases stress hormones, which can make us feel confused. It also makes our brains crave new things, distracting us easily. Glenn Wilson, a psychologist, found that trying to focus on a task while having an unread email can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. Multitasking can be worse than being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV, the information goes to a part of the brain for skills, not facts. Multitasking also involves making many decisions, which can tire our brains and lead to bad choices. Many people, including business leaders and scientists, find email overwhelming. It is not the email itself, but the large amount of communication. One neuroscientist's son said his father just answers emails all day, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do that and finish other tasks."
10,C1,"'In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions would not have been important. Animals had behaviors, and science recorded the results. The idea that animals have feelings and moral systems was seen as sentimental. But recently, this has started to change. Research into the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s Wild Justice and Victoria Braithwaite’s Do Fish Feel Pain?. It has started a debate: can animals be said to have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more pleasure than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for eating beef? The observations are clear, but their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of Second Nature, believes the only response is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the verge of a big change in ethics. Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, says we should rethink our view of animal thinking. He believes animals have a simpler theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. The issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an experiment that seems to show starlings, a type of bird, can get depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. Half were in nice cages with space and water, and the other half were in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. Later, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages ate them. Balcombe concluded that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic. Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, ‘We look back with horror on times of racism. Our view about animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.’ If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees. Manning has written a textbook, An Introduction to Animal Behaviour. He says, ‘We are seeing a change. In the early 20th century, people thought animals thought like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are going the other way. But it is a difficult subject, and you want to avoid the sound of academics with strong personal opinions.’'"
11,C1,"'Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to more deeply. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that argument can help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve problems and make it harder to think deeply. West notes that we are exposed to a lot of poor thinking and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. More data and information do not always lead to better knowledge or decisions. According to the National Endowment for the Arts, reading literature has decreased by 10%, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media can reduce critical thinking. She says that less reading might lead to less critical thinking because people focus more on real-time media and multitasking. There is no clear answer yet on how technology affects critical thinking. Technology has changed how people think, says Greenfield, who studied over 50 studies on learning and technology. Reading helps thinking and imagination in ways that video games and TV do not. However, visual media can improve some types of information processing. Most visual media do not allow time for reflection or imagination, which can lead to underachievement, especially in young people. How society views technology affects how it sees critical thinking. Video games and cognition show this conflict. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says video games can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills. They allow players to explore ideas in virtual worlds. In the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, we need to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis.'"
12,C1,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who used to work in an office. He became unhappy with office life and decided to write about how we should live. His first book talked about the benefits of manual work. His latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he noticed ads on a credit card machine while shopping. Crawford realized that these ads are hard to ignore and take our attention away from what we want to think about. This makes it difficult to remember conversations or think clearly. Because of this, people try to avoid interruptions and stop talking to strangers.
Crawford says we often see the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can control our desires. Many people are worried about this. For example, some office workers complain about emails but spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just seeing a phone on a table can distract us. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing.
Crawford believes technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves. We prefer texting friends instead of talking to them. This can make us lose important social connections. He gives an example of a gym where people used to share music, but now everyone listens to their own music with earphones. This change has made the gym less social.
Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he thinks we should do skilled activities that connect us with the real world. For example, cooking, playing ice hockey, or racing motorcycles require focus and dealing with real situations. These activities help us use our judgment and connect with others. They show that digital experiences are not as fulfilling as real ones. Crawford says it's important to find ways to use our judgment and focus on what matters. This helps us resist distractions and pay attention to important things."
13,C1,"""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, we answer this question in a few words. But when you are a philosopher, like me, it is a bit harder. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. People might think you claim to know some special truth. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why do people think this way about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle said that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, was the best life. Few modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked with thinking deeply. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just accepting what everyone else does is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make decisions. But living an examined life does not mean reading many philosophy books or thinking deeply all the time. It means looking closely at our daily experiences to see if they are important. It does not mean living away from society to think clearly. In fact, to help guide our lives, examining life is practical and should be shared with others. This is part of a good life. Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from real life. This is not all the philosophers' fault. University funding and evaluations focus on expensive and hard-to-access journals. So, philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. To outsiders, philosophy can seem far from reality. If philosophers once tried to change this view, many have stopped. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy focus on very specific debates, explaining them to non-experts is hard. Philosophy, in some cases, has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about evaluating human actions. But recently, I feel this title is not enough. Ethics is often seen as linked to rules and laws. This is a new idea in philosophy: ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often think about them. But philosophy is more than this. A discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is wrong (it is) and then look at responsibility, our views on art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps us look closely at our actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find what we already know; other times, we see our beliefs are hard to justify. By examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,C1,"People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, philosophers have often talked about food to explain other ideas. For example, they might use eating as a way to talk about learning. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other topics. 
An interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He talked about finding pleasure and avoiding pain in many parts of life. But today, his name is often linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants and food shops because people think it adds value to their products. 
Food is social and cultural. It comes from history and is shared with others in our communities. These communities give us people to eat with and help grow and distribute food. We interact with food more than any other product, making it an important topic to think about. 
Once food is made, critics talk and write about it. But why are they so important? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill, but good critics are just better at describing tastes. Most studies on perception focus on sight, not taste, and this should change. 
Food also has an aesthetic side. We say paintings or music are beautiful, but not usually food. Some philosophers think food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. But food is eaten and disappears, unlike art, which lasts over time. 
There are many ethical questions about food. What should we eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-GMO? Our choices show our beliefs, and philosophers ask why we make these choices. 
Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a duty to their guests because of love and friendship. In homes, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional cooks have duties to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are not open to everyone. 
A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways. First, we can appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food. Second, eating together helps us connect with people from other cultures, a practice used in international diplomacy. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories, making food philosophy lively for readers."
15,C1,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He thought the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. So, he wondered how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices in one game affect the next? He changed a classic game called Risk to make Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made during play have a lasting effect. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules. The game is played over several sessions, and past actions become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’
Daviau then worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players try to stop diseases. His next project was SeaFall, a game set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century). Players explore and conquer new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game plays out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said: ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but later it gets shaky, and then it breaks. Then you have to fix everything.’
Legacy games were not expected to be popular. Daviau thought it would be a small interest. ‘I thought it was different and good,’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks many rules. I thought only a few people would like it.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved it. He thinks it’s a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play.’
Another fan, Ben Hogg, liked the adventure of legacy games. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and ruining the board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice. You’re buying an experience. It’s like the stories in video games.’ The legacy format is also like popular TV series. Daviau wanted to be a TV writer but became a game designer. He still loves telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares legacy design to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how it ends and starts,’ he said. ‘But you also need more than just an outline.’
Daviau feels proud of his idea but wants others to explore it too. He thinks gamers will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, believes the legacy format changes how we think about board games."
16,C1,"'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online and seemed like something from a children's movie. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think animals are like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very smart but look very different from us. Octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in a smart way.
Some people think it's unscientific to say animals are like humans, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, disagrees. He says that not recognizing human-like traits in animals, which he calls ""anthropodenial,"" is more common. He has studied animal behavior for many years and found that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.
In the past, people thought animals were smart. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said that the difference between humans and animals is one of degree, not kind.
In the 20th century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines that responded to stimuli or as robots with instincts. People who thought animals had inner lives were considered unscientific. This view happened at the same time humans were destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.
Dr. de Waal believes we are now starting to see animal intelligence as similar to human intelligence, though not the same. He says that the best tests for animal intelligence consider the animal's unique traits. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, Sy Montgomery says that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might test us on how many color patterns we can make on our skin. We would fail, and the octopus might think we are not smart.
Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean. He knows that stories like Inky's can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the monkeys with cucumbers got upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video of the experiment convinced more people. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways.'"
17,C1,"'Robotics, once only in science fiction, is now a big change like the industrial revolution. Robots have been used in car and factory work for many years. Experts say robots will soon be used in many more areas, but many countries are not ready for this change. Most people think robots will do most jobs in the next 50 years, but they also believe their own jobs will still exist. This is not true: all job areas will be affected by robots soon. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that takes two people almost a day. In San Francisco, Simbe Robotics created Tally, a robot that checks if supermarket shelves are stocked and priced correctly. People who support robots say they will create new jobs for technicians and programmers. Critics say we should not forget the importance of human skills at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing jobs. His team says that soon, one-third of robots will be smarter and work with humans. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will have laws about robots. In five years, salaries in robotics will go up by 60%, but many jobs will be empty because there are not enough skilled workers. Zhang says lower-skilled workers will be affected and need to retrain. New robots will also be made for homes and will interact with us in new ways. This is a big chance for companies, but also a challenge because we need new rules for safety and privacy. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future. Countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it's there."" The reporter's question showed that many people want to understand why someone would do something so dangerous. Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams and face the unknown. It also reminds us that climbing can be about adventure and fun. 
In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He said that the style of climbing, like using more or less equipment, should follow the rules of the specific climbing activity. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in Western climbing discussions, from magazines to debates.
Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. However, climbing can also be limiting, like when a storm traps you in a tent. This shows a paradox in climbing: it can feel both freeing and restricting. But some say that having fewer choices can make life simpler, which is a kind of freedom.
US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is in our genes and that we naturally want to take on challenges, even if they are risky. So, the joy of climbing is more about biology than logic.
US academic Brian Treanor wrote that climbing can help develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He thinks these virtues are important in our modern world, which often avoids risks. Climbing can help people develop traits that are useful in everyday life.
Some climbers believe that those who climb without help from others or technology must be very committed to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson argued that climbing is more impressive when done independently, without things like bottled oxygen. This idea caused some controversy because it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.
Climbing can also be understood by looking beyond Western ideas. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone"" while climbing. The physical effort, meditation, and problem-solving involved in climbing are similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,B2,"'For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became very important in classical music. He was a serious and thoughtful person who played and recorded many famous European piano pieces. He wrote and played a lot, but he did not teach much. People who knew him well saw that he could be fun, but he did not show this side in his concerts. His life was full of study, travel, and performances. Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take him seriously. He had taught very few students and did not plan to start now. He said, ‘You don’t need a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something special about Kit, who was about 14 years old then. Brendel listened to him play. Brendel said, ‘He played very well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a small concert he did, where he played so beautifully that I thought, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that took you from the first to the last note. It’s rare to find a musician with this kind of understanding and skill.’ As Brendel is leaving the public stage, Kit is starting to enter it, but Brendel is careful that Kit does not get too tired too soon. Kit, now 19, is always busy when not in lessons – learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis. His mother is always watching over him. He also composes music. ‘This is very important,’ Brendel says. ‘Learning to read music well is easier if you try to write music yourself. I noticed that Kit has an amazing memory and is very good at reading music at first sight. But more important is his ability to listen to his own playing, his sensitivity to sound, and his ability to listen to me when I explain something. He not only understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it appears later.’ Brendel stops and looks serious. ‘I don’t want to raise any expectations. I get upset if newspapers try to do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century. It’s the worst thing. You don’t say that in a newspaper. It has done a lot of harm. Like many talented young players, he can play some things very well, but others need more time and experience. It would be bad if a critic expected the greatest perfection.’ Now at 80 years old, it is nice to see Brendel more relaxed in his later years. He explains, ‘When I was very young, I didn’t want to be famous in five years, but I wanted to have done certain things by the age of 50. When I was 50, I thought I had done most of those things, but there was still room for more, so I continued. Although I don’t have the physical strength now, in my mind, there are always things happening, all sorts of pieces that I’ve never played. I don’t play now, but it’s a very nice new career.’'"
20,B2,"'When I was little, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad's garden was not in a dirty city. It was next to a river and went down gently to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – places to escape, find peace, and be alone. Grandad's garden was simple. He didn't have a greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass was broken. At home, my father was often quiet. He wasn't without humor, though. He liked to say, 'It's immaterial to me,' instead of 'I don't mind.' He probably wished he had done more with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber. He didn't love plumbing; it was just his job. He wasn't very ambitious, but once he and Mum thought about moving to Canada, but it didn't happen. He was good at fixing things around the house. He could make bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents only moved house once. But my mother liked to change furniture often. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when we got a piano. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and took them away. I was never allowed to play the piano. My sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn't get lessons, she said, 'You'd never have practiced.' I liked the river best. I would go there with a fishing net and old sandals. I would find a spot, take off my sandals, and look for fish to catch. After trying to keep them alive at home, I would put them back in the river. I wanted to leave school as soon as I could, but it seemed impossible until my father said, 'There's a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.' My father might have wanted me to be a carpenter, but I think he saw my love for gardening. Even though he didn't like gardening, he saw my passion for it.'"
21,B2,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I do the same. A strong wind from the Atlantic threatens to blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and MacEwen gently pets him. The wind is strong, but MacEwen is comfortable here on his island. He is giving me a tour of the area. Pointing north, he shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds over Rum’s mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says, ‘I have sheep to move,’ as rain comes our way. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Muck is three km long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep stops our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to gather the sheep but is not doing well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen says, meaning the dog should go to the right. Tie doesn’t listen and goes straight into the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, sounding disappointed. The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They go out and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But island life has challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast with a flashlight. I get used to it, along with no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone away.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck seems surprising. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians with instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their boots to the music. That night, by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay from a newspaper ad, without seeing it. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know about farming? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is delicious. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to another island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months because of high seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, phone or no phone, I secretly hoped for."
22,B2,"'At first, the game design industry was mostly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people. But now, the video games industry is taken seriously. Experts are not surprised. Making video games is not easy. Games that come out after new movies need many team members and months of hard work. Like many industries, it is hard to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says: ‘It’s hard to make progress in big companies or to influence big games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just directors, but also people who design parts of the game.’ So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim disagrees. ‘The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You need to create something to get a job. Game design is more a way of life than a job.’ Another expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘Just doing it is important, but it’s more complicated. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs. Even fewer have the talent, skills, and vision to contribute to this changing field.’ Can you do it alone? ‘Maybe, but it’s hard,’ says John. ‘A good postgraduate course can help and give support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and move up. They are interested in all entertainment media and arts. They may have worked a few years after graduation and decided games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games. Connections can help too. Networking is important to get ahead in games.’ The idea of a young boy playing games all day is outdated. Now, games are seen as a serious medium. Families play on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. ‘Games are popular with large audiences. They are also a great way to learn. I see many possibilities and opportunities in this big area.’"
23,B2,"'Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy. He always told him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and never played football again. I'm glad it didn't happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score a great goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. Only by practicing can you score amazing goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned technique. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know education is important, but football was all I thought about then. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't notice it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope he doesn't just want to kick them around like I did. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so young players could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He didn't say, 'This is your big chance,' but we knew it was. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely on close friends and family a lot. Having a lot of money can cause problems. People say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' Of course, I've helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong, and they would be upset if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I like using my money to help people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think, and it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I want to take a year off to do things I couldn't do before. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I break a leg skiing and can't play football, I wouldn't be insured.'"
24,B2,"'We were living at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father couldn’t write in Los Angeles. Sam was worried about losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point was not popular with day trippers. The road was not nice, and the resort of La Carmella was nearby. People with money stayed there. Only people with little money or those who loved surfing came to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people came. After months alone, we were surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to write a script on time and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and Rusty, my dog. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to chase him away, but he always came back. One morning, I gave him water, and my father threw a boot at him, but not seriously. Rusty knew this and stayed closer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you think he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us.’ My father said, ‘You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found. Sometimes, he brought things like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, and I had to return them to their owners. He liked to swim too and always came with me, even though I swam faster and farther. He never got discouraged. We had been swimming that day. My father, after finishing his script, went to Los Angeles to deliver it. Rusty and I spent the afternoon in and out of the sea. But now, as the sun was setting, it was getting cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. They chose a wave and stood, balancing as the water curved up, riding the wave until it reached the sand. One surfer caught my eye. She had a style that made the others look clumsy. She decided to stop and rode in on a final wave. ‘Hi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’ ‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’ ‘You could get one.’ ‘No money.’ ‘You’re British, aren’t you? You visiting?’ ‘No, I live here.’ ‘Is your father American?’ ‘No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he wrote.’ ‘No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?’ ‘Rufus Marsh.’ ‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that book cover to cover.’ She looked at me with new interest, and I thought this was how it always was. They were friendly but never interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning.'"
25,B2,"Violet Hetherington was standing in a long queue at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this advice turned out to be wrong. An announcement said there was a problem with the computer system, which made the passengers upset. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service. Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left it there because all her contacts were in the phone. Her son Harry always warned her about this. 
Violet asked a couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was in her flat. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn't tell Harry that. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding because he was forgetful too.
Finally, the queue moved, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were fake walnut panels, shiny chandeliers, and carpets like those in airports. She took the elevator, crowded with tired passengers, to the twelfth floor. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she wanted. She had paid a lot to ensure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,B2,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he didn't know he was starting a journey into the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing interesting pictures. Since then, Maloof has collected many of Maier’s belongings. In his attic, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked at all of it and realized he had found something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They talked to families who hired her as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was known to be private and a bit unusual, always carrying a camera. She wore large coats, big hats, and strong shoes. ‘On her day off, she would leave with her camera in the morning and return late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. She wasn’t very social, but she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed very focused on her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone stop her.’ Maier’s work was pure art; she didn’t do it for money. Her photos often showed women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. ‘What is interesting about Vivian is that there are so many fascinating pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her style on her own. ‘Was Vivian very skilled or did she take ideas from others?’ Maloof often wonders if he will ever look through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. The funny thing is, he wasn’t interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I realized it wasn’t just about cityscapes. It was about people, street scenes, and composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to her work than I thought, and I realized I had found something very important. Now, our goal is to make her name known. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,B2,"'When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer. The officer asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are a series of crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past gave more chances for complications. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I ask how it feels to be successful at a young age, she says, ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels the success is partly theirs. There’s a family feeling at home, and I got a lot of support from people.’ Then she adds, ‘What is annoying is when people think my book is not a serious work.’ ‘I wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part is half the length of the one before it,’ said Catton. The book speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters if the reader notices this. ‘I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them.’ Despite the structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery. Surprisingly, she didn’t plan the story beforehand. ‘I would write myself into a corner and then see how I could get out of it.’ She also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We talk about her love of TV drama series. I ask if she might be interested in writing for TV. ‘That could be cool,’ she says. She is enthusiastic and laughs often. She loves talking about her work and New Zealand. ‘When I come to Britain, I notice how my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to busy places, to be around more people.’ But for now, New Zealand will still be her home. I hope it gives her ideas for more novels.'"
28,B2,"'As a boy, Jonny Kinkead liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. These two hobbies became his job for the last forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still amazed by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? And by using different types of wood, you get different sounds. It still surprises me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a holiday job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and woods changed the sound, and how to build them.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny made from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ‘We drew model boats and planes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use tools. I also fixed and changed instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar was good, but he didn’t think about a career in guitar-making. ‘I also liked painting and sculpture,’ he says. After school, he chose to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he remembers. But halfway through, he left the course. ‘I was too individualistic,’ he says. ‘But I left with a better idea of what I wanted to do. I still liked sculpture, but I realized guitar-making is like sculpture – it’s about shaping sound. And I thought it might be more practical than pure art because you make things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only covered the cost of materials, but as he became known as a great guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just making a living’. He admits he can only make ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. In the early years, he worked hard to become known. He went to music festivals most weekends and got musicians to try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments – when musicians asked, he didn’t have an answer because it wasn’t natural for him. Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the only good acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as real, even though we’ve always had good courses and skills here. But now our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says you can learn valuable techniques in the classroom, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take courses. However, he also believes there is no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If someone else teaches you, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’"
29,B2,"'When talking about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is a tradition, and many writers mention the famous comment by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist, who said, ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This is still true today. Many people try to explain why English people talk so much about the weather, but they often get it wrong. They think English people talk about the weather because they are very interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not exciting, so he doesn’t understand why people talk about it so much. He notes that England doesn’t have extreme weather like tornadoes or blizzards. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you never know what weather you will get. However, my research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the point. English people don’t really talk about the weather because they care about it. Instead, weather talk is a way to help English people start conversations. Phrases like ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ or ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ are not really about the weather. They are greetings or ways to start a conversation. This is similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially. There are specific times when English people use weather talk. It can be a greeting, a way to start a conversation, or a topic to fill a silence. This happens often, so people think English people are obsessed with the weather. An English conversation might start with weather talk, use it to break the ice, and return to it if there is a pause. This makes it seem like English people talk about nothing else.'"
30,B2,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip over trips to Spain, Greece, or France. But they wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. When she couldn't find a historical novel to help explain life at the Wall in Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. She felt it was a big change. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s a performance every day and very tiring. Writing is exciting but not as exhausting. My old teaching friends are jealous because I still connect with children through my books.’ Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction. ‘Many books for teenagers today are about negative experiences. They are well written,’ she adds, ‘but many are dark or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are different.’ Alice always taught English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy. She loves seeing children go from bored to interested and from not understanding to understanding. She sees her writing as an extension of teaching. She was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher also suggested she try a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course I didn’t think I needed.’ Before the course, she had to send her best piece of fiction. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted. During the course, other students liked her story and suggested she publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and he helped her edit the novel. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re rival authors, but we complement each other. He works with what I’ve written – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep adding more scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,B2,"'To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would be man against car, and brother against brother. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same place. Jonny would drive a car on roads, and Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. ‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and it’s very cold now, so I’ll be warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. He wore full winter cycling clothes, while Jonny wore jeans and a sweatshirt. Alistair was confident. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’ The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, 350 metres up. It might be easy for the car, but Alistair’s first miles had a steep hill, so he had a hard start. After a quick handshake, they began. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss. Jonny got in the car and drove on the road. They would see each other again at the finish line. Who would get there first? Jonny’s confidence was tested right away. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first problem. A giant tractor came out of a field and onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he said to the cameraman in his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!’ After the tractor was gone, Jonny was back on track, driving into the morning mist. Alistair was having trouble with the hill. A few miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched him as he kept going with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side, there was open ground. With the sun out, he could show his skills. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair gained speed. In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The villages in Yorkshire are old, and the roads are not made for speed. Jonny tried to drive through a very narrow corner. The car slowed down, then went through a stream on the road. After the last village, the car was on a straight path to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was crossing his last field and back on the road – coming to the finish from the other side. Head down, legs moving fast… and then he stopped at the line. Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the crowd. ‘No? Really?’ He raised his arms. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car arrived and Jonny got out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said, feeling disappointed. ‘I’m gutted.’'"
32,B2,"'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all make you feel separate from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hard to focus only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused that I forget there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, taught me from a young age that this was the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was telling my friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The defeat in 2006 was not so hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty years old. Federer beat me easily because I didn’t believe enough. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have done better, and it was my mind that failed me, not my ability. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me; he criticizes me even when I win. But I was so upset that he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this was probably my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete’s career is, and I want to make the best of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more, and I let a big one pass in 2007. Toni couldn’t ease my grief. Yet he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I’d learned from that defeat; that my mind would not fail this time. The best sign was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family and friends the night before the final, at the house we rent when I play at Wimbledon, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t forbid them from talking about it, but they knew I was already playing the match in my mind. From then until the start of play, that space was mine alone.'"
33,B2,"'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in April 1957. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made Jane Goodall famous with articles and TV shows about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century. However, her fame sometimes hides her real achievements. Many stories about her life focus on her adventures and dreams but miss her true work. Jane Goodall should be seen as a pioneer in her field and a leading zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We also did not know that they have emotions and social systems like humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her study of wild apes in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered a great scientific achievement. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves. Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. At five years old, she disappeared one day, and the police were called. She was found with straw in her hair. Jane explained she wanted to see how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours. This curiosity was the start of her career as a biologist.'"
34,B2,"'During our first conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using different voices. She sounds like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are known to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to say many medical words.’ Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it. You have to make the script come alive for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a normal acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a big part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and many forms, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of a job that includes many things from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and happy. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; working with other actors makes a big difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that help voiceover artists make them.’ She says she got where she is – near the top of her profession – through hard work as much as natural talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a love for human sound is important, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a certain kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’'"
35,B2,"'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many dream about as kids, like being a race car driver. But most people give up these dreams and choose more realistic jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles from school notebooks seems silly. Yet, some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school publications, and was known as ‘the kid who draws’. I studied graphic design in college and showed my drawings to different companies after graduating. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to live on. You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a degree, much money, or even to be great at drawing. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are low, but it’s still a hard job. Don’t try to be a cartoonist unless you feel you can’t do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and leaves time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t say no to any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about everything. What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are almost over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to make and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than those who are very artistic but lack business sense. I often meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they won’t show their work to anyone! To protect your work, just draw a ‘c’ for ‘copyright’, put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But honestly, it’s more likely no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it might actually be a lucky break!'"
36,B2,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of those things was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to throw this away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it on a pile of trash when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, ""You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?"" I said I was, but I already felt a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways. In the years that followed, I often felt sad about what I had done. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. It was from a man named Keith Rushton, who deals with and fixes guitars. He wrote, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back. He used my name to find me online and contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He offered to sell it back to me for a fair price. I was so emotional. I had forgotten that my dad used to put name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this strange story! My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s because it was very popular. I loved its calming sound, but I didn’t make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn’t need to play well to be a rock star. When I got my old guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I felt the need to stand up and play it with a strap over my shoulder. My fingers remembered where to go, even though I couldn’t draw a diagram of the chords. My fingertips felt the pain of pressing the strings. The electric guitar is not really for playing alone. Now that I’m learning it again, maybe I’ll form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are others like me, and we could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!"
37,B2,"'Recently, there has been a lot of talk about sleep. When I wrote the book Insomniac, about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is getting more attention now. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them. We often lose dreams when we wake up early. The last hour or two of sleep, which we often miss, is mostly REM or ‘Rapid Eye Movement’ sleep, where we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen in REM sleep, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM. When people are deprived of REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night. This suggests dreams are important. In 1953, researchers discovered REM sleep. Many agreed with Sigmund Freud, who thought dreams were the best way to understand our minds. But later research did not support this idea. Now, dream studies focus more on the physical origins of dreams. There is still much that dream researchers do not agree on, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study. It found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. He concluded that people who are interested in creativity use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don’t teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Dreams, Stickgold says, help us connect things in new and surprising ways. They help us find new patterns and ideas. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They make unexpected connections. This is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come to me quickly. I don’t know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn’t just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream.'"
38,B2,"'Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London for a small town by the sea in south-west England. In her studio, you see empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a pioneer in the copyist art movement. She can recreate the beauty of a 20th-century impressionist painting or a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait. But she doesn't keep her own work. 'As soon as I finish them, they go,' she says. Susie is very popular. In her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts think they are originals. While the originals are worth millions, her copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie doesn't name most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors love art, but others want to show off. One celebrity likes to brag about his 'Van Gogh' painting, which is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. 'Many famous people pretend my copies are originals,' she says. 'That's their choice.' Some collectors keep the original in a bank and display Susie's copy at home. Susie is honest about her work. She makes her copies look as real as possible and signs her name on the back. Pretending a copy is real is illegal, and she avoids that. People who make fake art often get into trouble. Susie isn't rich and has had hard times, but her life is more stable now. She doesn't want to risk her reputation. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She earned very little, but it was good practice for her current work and gave her a love for plants. She had to be very precise in her drawings. She has no regrets but is glad she found something better financially. When young artists ask for advice, Susie tells them to learn to draw accurately. She has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants, make perfect copies of 15th-century art, and reproduce 20th-century abstract art. Now, she focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie says people think modern art is easy, but it's not. Impressionists painted quickly but carefully, and that mix is hard to do well. It's surprising that Susie doesn't create her own art. Isn't art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She says her work is the result of years of training, and she earns well from it. She has tried her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked like photos. Susie is a perfectionist.'"
39,B2,"During her racing days, nothing was more important to Ellen MacArthur than the sea, except maybe being the fastest on it. She loved the sea since she was a child. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly wanted to return to the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a non-stop, solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and work space for 94 days. She talked about how carefully she planned everything, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. Preparation was key, she said. She proudly showed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and medical necessities. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.
Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her think. 'It seemed like we just took what we wanted and moved on. That’s what we do.' When I visit Ellen’s office, she finishes a conference call and explains why we must act now to save the planet. 'No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious and limited. We need to find a way not to use them up.' At first, her message was to use less, but now she talks about re-using, like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. 'I will never be an expert,' she says. 'But I love learning. [The current situation] became something I couldn’t ignore. Sailing seemed selfish in comparison. This is different. It’s about finding how my voice can help. It really matters.'
She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to help young people think about a sustainable future. 'I do miss the adventure of being at sea,' she says. 'It is a big part of who I am. You feel connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on the record, on practical things, on survival. [My new] message is not as simple as saying: “I’m going to be the fastest person around the world.” I may have been the fastest, but this is more important than anything I’ve done before.'"
40,B2,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he could become very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to inspire them to go outside and try new things. Jordan's team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero.' Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.
Some experienced Everest climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the mountain. They agree that a young person might be strong enough, but they worry if a teenager is emotionally ready. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing. The Romeros know about these opinions. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that. We have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.'
I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father loves adventure? Paul says, 'This is not about me becoming famous because of my son. At first, Jordan talked about doing this later, but we thought: why not now? We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'
In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record challenge. This gives Jordan a problem. People might say that focusing on records takes away the fun, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to share his story. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.'"
41,B2,"'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they are not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won’t know who he is. I have just started a music degree, but my classmates don’t know much about classical music either. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t have any of their recordings. The numbers are not good for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find that hard to believe. So, why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I’m not a big classical music fan. I like many styles, but I don’t listen to much classical music. So why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Experts say we can only focus for about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more interesting to us than long classical pieces without words. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people are going to classical concerts now, but I bet not many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don’t know why more people like classical concerts as they get older, but I know that if your parents like something, you might avoid it. Some say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They like classical music when they play it, but it’s not their first choice to listen to. When we want to relax, we choose pop music.'"
42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the other side of the car and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be thrown out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. The horses were well cared for, she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He looked lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" said Bonnie, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to win a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you."" The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, which made Bonnie happy. She was so focused on putting a saddle on Maverick that she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I mean it, because I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The movement was exciting, and the breeze made her cheeks glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well."
43,B2,"Cody Simpson is a 15-year-old Australian who has become famous for his music. He is known for being quietly confident. Cody started playing the guitar at six and began writing songs at seven. He loved swimming and surfing, and these activities were very important to him. When he was 13, he posted some videos online of himself singing at a school concert. People loved the videos and wanted more, so Cody shared more videos from home. The response was amazing.
Cody was also a talented swimmer and trained with top coaches. But when record labels showed interest in his music, he had to make a big decision: stay in Australia to swim or move to the US to pursue music. Cody chose music, even though it was a difficult choice at such a young age. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. It was a surprise to many because Cody is a quiet person. He believes it's important to stay humble in the music industry.
Cody moved to the US with his family, leaving one dream to follow another. His family supports him but stays out of the spotlight. Cody thinks it's important to have good people around to keep him grounded. Sometimes, he worries about how his decision affects his younger brother and sister, especially his eight-year-old brother who travels and studies on the road. But his family reassures him that they support him.
Cody believes success comes from taking opportunities, even if they are scary. He is amazed by how quickly everything happened and feels lucky to visit new countries and perform for many fans. He knows this success might not last forever, but he is grateful for the experience."
44,B2,"'I jumped out of bed, lifted a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the wall of sandbags. They were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I worked with most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing I could do it. But my grandfather didn’t notice much. With one hand still on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile of steaming black water from the factory in Milltown. There was fragile ice on both sides, and solid ice downstream. As I took off my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. I didn’t know him. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and reached for my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Better than having a famous grandfather is having this chain, which only he, my mom, and I know about. Plus, I have the diary he kept on that journey. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I patted the chain again and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled at me as I grabbed a banana. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa. ‘Can’t you watch where you’re going?’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ As if my wetsuit didn’t make that clear. As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s getting harder. ‘What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. For a moment, his words hurt. But I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. Mom appeared with a kind smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say he’d always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero – from the time he showed me photos of him in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. And yet, a part of me still wants to stay close to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I hurried to the boathouse.'"
45,B2,"Mum grabbed Jess's arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unfinished painting by Grandpa. It was different from his other works. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. It showed a river, but not one she knew. It might not even be a real river, just a fantasy one. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely visible, and the eye was drawn to the pale waters leading to a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant scene. Yet, Jess was fascinated, thinking of autumn after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, hiding her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words felt important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? Maybe he's going to add the boy later. I asked him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without explaining it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. If artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting since you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" ""Someone who gives an artist ideas."" She knew what it meant. Grandpa often used the word when she watched him paint. He'd say the muse wasn't kind to him today or he needed to be nice to the muse for a difficult part. He never suggested the muse was her. She thought it was a goddess, not a person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,B2,"'When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's knife in my hand, the blade might have cut the carpet by itself. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't mean to damage the carpet. I didn't wake up thinking, 'Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.' It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm unlucky that way. I was actually trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute! Very small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers, and tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it. I keep my collection of shells and fossils there. Gran knew I always loved her cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I have only two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But Angela is only fifteen, so I'll be in my small room for years. I don't mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a bit too tall. If I could just cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom... Then I thought, if I can't cut the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased. He always tells us to 'think outside the box'. And that's what I was doing!'"
47,B2,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' view, not a human one, which made filming more complex. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off because she was sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was shot with actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,B2,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren't there. Let's see how long it takes before the craziness starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the ""can-you-get-me-free-tickets-to-one-of-your-dad’s-concerts?"" 'Everything’s going to be fine,' I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone with this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. To leave my old life on the road and with tour tutors. So while the rest of the band is renting here during the recording, we’re staying for good. I wanted to come to this school because I want to meet real kids. Like a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so cool. So normal. I walk into the school’s main office. 'Hi, I need my schedule please,' I tell the school secretary. 'Name?' She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. 'Desert McGraw.' 'Desirée?' she asks, leaning closer. 'Desert,' I repeat. The secretary seems confused. 'Oh,' she says and types 'McGraw' on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad only uses his stage name. 'What grade?' 'Eleventh.' 'One second, it’s printing,' the secretary says. Then she hands me the paper. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, so I wouldn’t look lost. When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already calling names. 'Aurelio Gonzalez.' 'Here.' She continues while I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes look at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! 'Nice shoes,' she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. Dead giveaway. 'Thanks,' I say. The teacher pauses. 'Desert... McGraw?' she says slowly. 'Here.' The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she actually gives us time to talk! All teachers should do this. 'So why’d you move here?' my new friend asks. I have lots of choices here. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? 'We need a change, Desert,' he said, 'and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.' Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they pick South Beach Sounds, a studio near the sand? 'My dad had to relocate,' I tell her. Yes, lies work better. 'What does he do?' she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. 'He’s an artist,' I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. 'Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.' And she doesn’t seem to care. Excellent."
49,B2,"'Today, the average American teenage girl is expected to do many things. She should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what being an American teenager is like now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and be average. Being average is not enough anymore. If you don't have big goals, people might think you are lazy. Many adults forget how much pressure teenagers have today. We have lots of homework, tests, activities after school, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. We also try to have a social life,’ says teenager Kristen Loose. Even though these pressures are normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes about them still exist. People often think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might be like this, it is not fair to say all of them are. ‘Many people think we spend most of our time watching TV or using our phones,’ Loose says. Loose thinks this is not true. She keeps her phone close, but not just for fun. It helps her and others in their daily lives. Students today are expected to have quick access to information and be reachable all the time, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their work anywhere. They can even listen to language lessons while going to school. Schoolwork and activities now need attention all day, adding to the stress of busy teens. Many teenagers start their day at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. They often get less than the nine hours of sleep they need. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teens get enough sleep. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school at least once a week because they are so tired. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time each week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen does not waste this time on social media or TV. She spends a lot of it volunteering. ‘People think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests,’ Olsen says. But she loves volunteering and making a positive impact in her school and community. In 20 years, we don't know what people will think about teenagers, but they will still be proving stereotypes wrong and making the world better. There will be a new generation of students who will change the world, even before they finish school.'"
50,B2,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the last few years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a science project with a twist: it’s part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, inflates the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chant, and the balloon rises. Some run and track it with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There is quiet and a sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the clear sky, just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I see a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon expands until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who notes they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then up the western side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘These students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to others.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It’s a bit disappointing, but it’s a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountains. And it’s another adventure story to share."
51,B2,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. It happened by accident. Her younger brother was interested in dinosaurs, a common phase for children, which she hadn't gone through. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in the field. It amazed her, and she knew she wanted to study it. Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people then. Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous. She was nervous, but he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.
Chloe talks about how movies and TV shows portray palaeontologists. Films like Jurassic Park have increased interest in dinosaurs but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She feels that palaeontologists are often shown as either eccentric geniuses or geeky losers, which is not accurate. Her job is varied; she digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, and writes for scientific publications. She also communicates scientific findings to the public, which she takes seriously. She wants to clear up misunderstandings about science and reach out to young people to get them interested in the natural world.
Chloe worked on the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs. She advised the makers to ensure the dinosaurs were accurate. The show attracted audiences of all ages because it showed dinosaurs in a new way, different from movies like Jurassic Park. Chloe believes dinosaurs fascinate us because they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. They remind us that there is still more to learn about our world, and Palaeontology is like time travel."
52,B2,"""I will say this once: when you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not 'there yet,' even if you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' The truth is, when you arrive, it becomes 'here,' not 'there.' So, if you think you might be 'there,' you should ask 'Are we here yet?' Parents probably want to be 'there' more than kids do, because they hear this question many times during long car trips. What are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles, while the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, mum or dad is there to give out juice boxes and cookies, change the radio station, and keep everything running smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying – like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then he puts his other foot, and then a hand, and soon he is in my space and we start fighting. The driver and co-pilot separate us and tell Tim to stay in his seat. This calms things down for a while. The beautiful scenery continues to pass by. Later, I try to read, but I feel a breeze on my arm. The window is not open, so where is it coming from? Tim is blowing on me from his seat. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is not doing anything wrong. The anger grows. Tim gets told off, and there is more swerving. Then things calm down again – for now. Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. For example, when we ask 'Are we there yet?' he often says, 'Yes. We are here. Get out of the car.' 'But Dad, we are still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour.' 'Oh, maybe we are not there yet.' This keeps us quiet for a while. You know you are finally 'there' when the adults get out of the car and move far away from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no, you are not there yet."""
53,B2,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and come back. Zuzi says they started the café because everyone is busy with phones and gadgets, and they wanted to bring people together without screens. The games in their café are called 'Eurogames', which have gentle themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, where players build settlements and trade resources. This game keeps everyone involved and was followed by 'co-operative' games where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. Pandemic is a Eurogame where players solve global problems together. It was created by Matt Leacock, who was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings. Leacock loved board games since he was a child, even though he often found them disappointing. With his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic was very successful and its next version included storytelling, character development, and changing rules. Video games have helped the success of board games because they made playing games normal. Ben Hogg, from a games company, says everyone with a smartphone plays games now. Video games used to be social in arcades or with friends at home, but now they are mostly online. Some people miss playing games with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun; they are a way to connect with others in real life, and this trend is growing."
54,B2,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many challenges. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him start playing the guitar. At home, he only listened to a local radio station for middle-aged people, which influenced him as he grew up. He says he was 12 before he heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. He says, ‘With tennis, I was at a high level, but it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was too much hard work.’ At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to write songs and play music. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to get a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. In the end, he became successful behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not come. He says, ‘In my artist career, I was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, I was in the right place at the right time.’ Writing for others is where he found success. He says, ‘I’d like to think I am one of the main writers in the UK that labels send new artists to.’ This helps start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that writing with the charts in mind is okay. He asks, ‘Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?’ He believes they should write songs that are amazing and likely to sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone speak honestly about wanting to write number-one hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he just knows he wants to write hits and has the talent to do it. He focuses on writing the best music. ‘That’s the goal when I go into the studio,’ he says. ‘We need to write the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.’"
55,B2,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online, but people who don't watch online videos of bike stunts might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist'. This means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online.
I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys knew him well, and even older people came to say he is 'an absolute legend'. After seeing his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, Tony explained what he wanted to do, and I wasn't always sure he could do it. But he did, and when I praised him, he didn't seem very interested. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he doesn't like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans and prefers doing stunts instead of talking about them.
Tony's fame comes from social media and new camera technology. This technology helps him make a living. He says, 'Sometimes I feel everyone is looking at a screen, and I don't always like that.' But he is not complaining. His videos help him earn money from what used to be just a hobby.
I have learned from interviewing top athletes that two things are important to become great: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent. In risky sports, you need mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times but kept trying until he succeeded.
Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport. They don't know he gets expert advice to make the stunts safer. Tony is careful about risks. He says, 'Some people never get scared, but they shouldn't do these sports. It's good to know the dangers. I feel fear but find a way to overcome it. I plan and prepare a lot. Sometimes I ride around to get ready before a new stunt. I know I must not lose my nerve before I jump. If I fully commit, I'm fine.'"
79,C2,"'In recent years, universities in the UK and around the world have started to encourage new students to get involved with research early in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in jobs, as they help you think about the world and your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat it; you create it. Creating knowledge means asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if this were different? These questions are part of what we call research. Research can be very complex and world-changing, done by highly trained people. But it can also be simple, like asking questions about everyday things. Most students have done some research before, like for school projects or at work. You have also used research skills when planning a holiday, fixing things at home, or shopping online. In college, you are expected to have an enquiring mind, find problems and questions, explore information, and create your own ideas. Some students may find this hard because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as something you get from teachers and books without questioning. But in the UK, US, and many other places, it is important to question knowledge and authority. This can be challenging, but critical thinking is very important in research. We need to not just repeat what we read but think about it, test it, and see if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should not just accept information without questioning it.'"
80,C2,"Cities have always been places of learning and creativity. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.
Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains. They have found that cities can make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees. Even a small view of nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from city life.
For the first time in history, most people live in cities. We are crowded into busy places with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a city requires our brains to focus on many things, like avoiding traffic and watching out for dangers. This constant attention is tiring because our brains have to decide what to focus on and what to ignore.
Natural places, on the other hand, do not need as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature helps our brains recover. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens.
Long ago, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York give people a break from city life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people try many things to boost brain power, like energy drinks or changing office designs, simply walking in nature seems to be very effective.
Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain centers of creativity. Research shows that the same crowded city features that tire our brains also lead to innovation. The many social interactions in cities drive creativity. Just like 18th-century London, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are successful creative hubs.
The challenge is to reduce the mental stress of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people get tired of nature and want to return to the city."
81,C2,"'Where should we look for the mind? Many people think that thinking happens only inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain scans to show this. But I believe the study of the mind should not stop at the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, that objects and tools also play a part in how we think. Archaeology shows that stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and the development of the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might also be part of the mind. 
It is easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most studies on the mind separate people from the objects around them. This is necessary for brain scans, but it misses the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I do not deny that the brain is important for thinking, but I believe the mind is more than just the brain. Human intelligence might extend beyond the brain into culture and the material world. This is the idea behind a new theory I developed called Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking, like when we use clay to make numbers or a stone to make a tool. It also studies how these ways have changed over time and what that means for how we think.
Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The stick and the person become one, showing how the mind and objects can be connected. The stick helps the blind person feel the world, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. This shows that human intelligence can change by using new tools. My approach sees the human mind as always evolving. The 'stick' in our history, from stone tools to the internet, is a pathway for understanding the world. Humans use 'sticks' to learn and discover. This is why humans make things, and these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds change as they interact with the material world. MET offers a new way to understand how objects, from stone axes to smartphones, have shaped and changed our minds. Mind-changing technology sounds futuristic, but humans have used it since they first evolved.'"
82,C1,"'Few inventions have changed the world as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture. It was used in many areas, like science, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians say photography might be the greatest American contribution to the visual arts. Photography became very important in the US, and to understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century. Why was photography so popular? First, because it was a mechanical process, it matched the growing interest in technology. Like steam power and railroads, photography brought the world closer, showing people new sights. Second, the camera was a tool to represent oneself, important in a country where identities were always changing. Third, the camera helped families keep a record of themselves, even if it was idealized. Finally, photographs were realistic, matching the US artists' focus on everyday life. A photograph shows what the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""This, you should see!"" Photographs are records of events, people, and things, showing what was in front of the camera. But they also show the photographer's point of view. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, but its meaning is more complex. No image is shown without some information that affects how we understand it, like a caption or its place in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to know why it was made and how people first saw it. The same image can have different meanings in different places and times. Photography's importance to artists was once a secret, but now it is well-known. For decades, artists like Andy Warhol have used photographs in their work. Photographic vision is now seen as an important part of art, not separate from painting, but essential to it.'"
83,C1,"'In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, called psychology the ‘science of mental life’. This definition is still useful today. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we have some idea of what mental life means. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is often focused on humans. James believed human psychology includes thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we understand these things. This understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences. We often act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on why people behave in certain ways, like feeling unhappy or quitting their jobs. However, people can see things differently, which can cause problems. Formal psychology tries to find the best explanations for these situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between personal opinions and scientific facts. They study the mind and brain, but they do not fully understand how the brain works. Instead, they learn by observing behavior and making guesses about what happens inside us. Psychology is like solving a puzzle, using clues from careful observation and analysis. It aims to describe, understand, predict, and control behavior. Psychology helps in many areas, like teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings. Although people have talked about psychological questions for a long time, scientific study of psychology began about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or looking into one's own mind, to find answers. But this method has limits. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on observing others' behavior rather than just their own thoughts.'"
84,C1,"'In a storehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows the other side of consumer culture, where not all products succeed. Here, you can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were not popular and were taken off the market. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story of failure for the designers and marketers. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business. Many companies do not keep their failed products, so executives visit the museum to learn from these mistakes. The museum started by accident when Robert McMath, a former marketing man, began collecting new products in the 1960s. He wanted a 'reference library' of products, not just failures. However, he discovered that 'most products fail,' so his collection mostly includes unsuccessful items. This shows how today's culture of optimism might lead to failed products. People in meetings might not realize a product will fail, or they might invest more money to try to make it succeed. Often, no one wants to talk about what went wrong. This focus on optimism is also common in the 'self-help' field, where people believe that thinking positively will lead to success. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that people tend to believe things will go better than they actually might. Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen studied 'positive fantasies' and found that thinking too much about success can reduce motivation. People who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less. Psychologist Carol Dweck says our view of failure depends on our beliefs about ability. Some people think ability is fixed, while others believe it can grow with effort. Those who see ability as fixed fear failure because it shows their limits. In contrast, those who see ability as changeable view failure as a chance to grow. Dweck compares this to weight-training: muscles grow stronger when pushed to their limits. Having a mindset that embraces growth is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success.'"
85,C1,"'Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. On the other hand, people who manage money in sports wonder if home advantage should matter. If players are paid well, shouldn't they play well anywhere? 
What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who think their team needs their support. Fans often believe that when they cheer, their team scores. But they forget the times when cheering didn't lead to a goal. 
However, one thing fans believe is true. Home fans often try to influence the referee. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees might avoid making decisions that upset the home crowd.
Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are similar. Yet, these changes don't fully explain the data.
Home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. One reason might be that baseball is more about individual players, while basketball and football require teamwork. Playing at home might boost team confidence.
Another reason could be related to players' emotions. Studies found that players' testosterone levels were higher before home games. This might be a natural urge to defend their home ground. In the Rugby World Cup, some home teams won against stronger opponents by using determination and aggression, showing home advantage. As one referee said, 'It’s the law of the jungle out there.''"
86,C1,"""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is valued by athletes and coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with many claiming it came from other golfers. Its meaning is also interesting. Player didn’t mean he was literally lucky; he meant, ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate: is talent something you are born with, or can it be developed? In sports, the focus has been more on practice than on natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for the idea that you can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory is popular and has inspired books like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers."" These books suggest that practice is the most important factor in becoming an expert. However, in his book, Epstein argues that practice alone is not enough. He points out that studies often focus only on successful people, which can be misleading. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others don’t, looking at factors like environment, support, and determination. He travels around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that the drive of husky dogs in sled races might be partly genetic. This suggests that determination might also have a genetic component. Epstein talks about the difference between 'hardware' (nature) and 'software' (nurture) and says both are important for elite athletes. He does not ignore the role of training or environment, suggesting that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a basketball player instead of a sprinter. Epstein also discusses race and gender, asking why men and women compete separately if only practice matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most important."""
87,C1,"'A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks: why are children today so unhappy? In her book, Kith, Griffiths explains that children spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers, and have lost touch with nature. She believes this is the main problem. A study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their childhoods fondly, talking about playing outside all day. They think this was healthier than how children live now. However, these adults are the ones who have made rules to keep their children safe indoors. Griffiths discusses how fear of danger keeps kids inside and helps the toy and gadget industry sell more products. She also talks about how some children are given medicine for being restless or are made to wear goggles for playground games. Griffiths is passionate about children having freedom, but sometimes she goes too far. She compares modern treatment of children to racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths is very romantic about children, seeing them as perfect, which might not be realistic. She believes children should have freedom to explore and take risks, saying they need small accidents to learn. But she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are safe. Also, not all children want to explore; some are naturally quiet and prefer staying home. Maybe the real issue is forcing all children to live the same way, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside.'"
88,C1,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my schooling. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the value of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced in play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems, not just follow instructions or do routine calculations. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate problems, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play'. He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring for them, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit. If you can't quit, it's not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue the game. This makes play very democratic. School has become harder: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, warnings from experts, less community, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children need more play, not more school. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change this trend. We must give childhood back to children. They need to follow their natural drives to play and explore to become strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,C1,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to contact potential employers directly. This is similar to standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with more access, there is also a higher chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive had many important contacts, and the jobseeker hoped they could help him get a job. But the executive was upset by his request. She refused his contact request and sent a harsh rejection note, which became very popular online. People who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone. However, this incident might help young people think more carefully about using social media for work. It shows that social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly. Many young people are making mistakes. This is ironic because social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of their social lives for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress and experiment, often based on fantasy. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. By choosing certain pictures or songs for your Facebook page, you could become a different person overnight. But when using social media for professional networking, our experience with sites like Facebook might be a problem. Using social media for work is very different, but some young people do not see the difference. We first became popular online by being bold and confident, which might be why some of us still think this is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook, it does not mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you are worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers does not apply now. We must meet employers' standards to succeed in the job market. Employers often complain that young job seekers on professional networking sites are too familiar and seem arrogant. This makes older generations think of us as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many of us are desperate to find jobs, which is why we use social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt young people's chances of getting a job, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable workers. So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach gives you a better chance of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal emails, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it needs careful handling to avoid closing doors."
90,C1,"'Predicting the future of newspapers is very difficult. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people buying UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to a half. In the USA, only 26% of people now say newspapers are their main news source, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. However, old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they survived. Theatre, radio, and cinema have all continued despite new media like TV and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales up 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too. They became popular in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. People started to want regular news updates. In medieval times, people didn't expect change and only noticed big events like famine or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. Back then, people didn't need news every day or week. Newspapers have a fixed format, but online news is flexible. Online, we can choose news that interests us and get updates quickly. Mistakes can be fixed fast, and there is no limit to how much can be written. However, online news often focuses on being first and getting comments, which can cause confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand our chaotic world.'"
91,C1,"'If humans were truly comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy walking in the dark, just like many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This is a basic part of who we are, even if we don't often think about it. This is why we have changed the night by adding light to it. We have filled the night with artificial light, similar to how we control rivers with dams. This has benefits, but also problems, known as light pollution. Light pollution happens because of poor lighting design, which lets light shine into the sky instead of focusing it on the ground. This extra light changes the natural darkness, affecting many living things, including us. It can disturb migration, reproduction, and feeding. In the past, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800. Back then, nearly a million people lived there, using candles and lanterns. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no streetlights. From a distance, you would smell London before seeing its faint glow. We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but it is not. Many animals are active at night. Light is a strong force in nature, attracting many species. For example, birds can be drawn to bright lights, circling them until they are exhausted. Birds migrating at night may crash into tall, lit buildings. Some birds sing at strange times because of artificial light. People once thought light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need a clear night sky. But we all need darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can cause health problems. Our sleep and wake cycles are linked to the Earth's light and dark cycles. Changing these rhythms is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are affected by light pollution just like animals near bright lights. We have lost touch with the natural night sky and the rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our place in the universe, which we can best understand by looking at the stars and the Milky Way above us.'"
92,C1,"The founder of a big international company recently said that his company will stop keeping track of employees' paid holiday time. This idea was inspired by an internet company with a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. Some people think this announcement is just a way to make the company look good, but is the idea practical?
The internet company and the big international company are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the big company has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work better. In a big company, it might be hard to know if taking time off will hurt the business.
The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work is up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But is it possible to be that sure? Even if you prepare before a holiday, there is always work waiting when you return. This can make employees feel guilty about taking time off, leading to stress and lower productivity.
There might also be pressure from coworkers about who takes time off and for how long. In many companies, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave. Without a set amount of leave, people might feel they can't take time off because they don't want to seem lazy.
Modern technology makes it hard to separate work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees wanted to know how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours, why should it track time off? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might feel they are always being watched, which can be stressful.
Employment laws give workers a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like better morale and creativity, can happen without affecting worker well-being. So, I am not sure if ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is really the goal or the likely result of this policy."
93,C1,"'Journal-based peer review is the process where experts check a scientific research paper before it is published. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. This process can delay publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to make sure the research is trustworthy? The answer is both yes and no. The world of scientific publishing is changing. I still believe in peer review, but things are shifting. Preprints, which are drafts of papers shared online without peer review, are becoming more common. They allow new research to be shared quickly so others can read, critique, and build on it. Publishing in journals is often about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can lead to problems. Scientists may cut corners to get published in top journals, and reviewers may focus more on whether a paper is suitable for a journal rather than its quality. These issues are known, but few are willing to change the system. Preprints might be a solution because they don't require a big change. Some scientists worry that preprints could lead to 'junk science,' but this hasn't happened yet. Preprints are open for critique by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience with preprints. Her paper critiqued another paper, which is hard to do in traditional journals. With preprints, the original authors could respond, and all comments were public. This openness helps readers judge the quality of the arguments. Preprints also allow for sharing negative results, which journals often overlook. They increase how often papers are read and cited. By using the internet's openness, preprints focus on the work itself, not where it is published.'"
94,C1,"'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is like ‘a painting in words’. Their answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist, and another from the object's point of view, called ‘Poem.’ Here’s what one student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. The item? An oxygen mask – a surprising choice that helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. When I was in school, poetry was confusing to me. I thought every poem was a difficult puzzle that stopped me from understanding and feeling. After school, most people find poetry less interesting. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It almost challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down because it seems plain or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we want from poems? Aren’t they supposed to have deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might be yes. But if we want to cry, we watch movies; for information or strong opinions, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. But a poem can offer something special: ambiguity. Everyday life is full of it, unlike reading sentence by sentence. But these ideas still don’t explain what a poem really is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it leads to ‘poetry': ‘a form of literary art using the beauty and rhythm of language.’ This is academic language, but it hides the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes say poems are like wild animals – untameable, unpredictable – or like machines – carefully made and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t always work. The best part of comparing a poem to something else is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It helps us think differently and see common things in a new way. A poem as a mental object is not hard to imagine, especially when we think about how song lyrics can stay in our minds. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes such as ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine, looking at you: A poem can touch us deeply like nothing else, even though, as ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all the empty space around the poem – space that could be used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it never really becomes what they usually are – something made to be sold. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry books, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not for the market, but for itself. Because it is special – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment.'"
95,B2,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I have enjoyed finding every brooch and coin. It makes me feel connected to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 
One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming tools. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a metre and was lying in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, I saw it was a thick, beautifully patterned loop. I stopped and stared. I remembered seeing something like it before—the Great Torc in the British Museum. It’s a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. Torc means ‘twist’ and it’s made of gold and silver. Each end has a gold ring like the one I found. 
I took it to my car. On the drive home, I kept looking at the torc on the seat next to me. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. ‘Marion!’ I called, ‘I have something for you.’ She came in, stopped, and asked, ‘What is it?’ I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn’t try it on because we didn’t want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I was worried. I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there. The law says you must report such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, stopped talking, and stared. The torc was checked and sold to my local council. It’s now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was split between the field owner and me. But the torc is more than just money. It’s something I saved for the nation. People ask if I will stop detecting now that I found something amazing. But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn’t stop fishing. He keeps going, hoping for an even bigger fish tomorrow."
96,B2,"'Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When friends tell me about their busy trips, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for naps in the afternoon and lazy mornings in bed? Better sleep is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept – more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Far from home, I could sleep deeply and have dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes easier. But I think travel sleep is different for another reason. I believe sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. During sleep, we process all this new information. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with different places. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local habits is harder. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I truly belong there. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all felt sleepy and lay down on hammocks and sofas. I realized why they had so many pillows. I joined them and experienced the siesta, a traditional nap. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too.'"

""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little hat will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. It had been a while since everyone was together, and she was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, Tattie, who they knew nothing about. Her husband Jeff had commented on the name when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff said, ""What sort of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" Jeff didn't like anything too fancy or showy. He also didn't believe in being too polite, as he called Mia's way of not speaking her mind. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a trash can lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and went into the back door of Medlar House. Her commute from work was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia had the idea to turn the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends that there was a demand for the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham. In a relaxed and friendly place, they could try on many hats to find the right one. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits so nothing was left to chance. She recently started selling handbags and costume jewelry too."
98,B2,"'Lawrence Okoye has traveled a long way from London to Atlanta. He is on an amazing sports journey. Lawrence was in the Olympic final for discus throwing, and now he might join a big American football team. This is surprising because he has never played American football before. In Atlanta, he is learning about his new position in the team. It seems unbelievable that a 21-year-old from London could be chosen for a top American team, but Lawrence is used to surprising people. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on discus instead. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus, aiming for the world championships. He thought about American football before, but it seemed crazy. After arriving in America, he read about NFL trials in Atlanta and decided to try. Even though he had never played, he applied for the trials. Was he nervous to compete with experienced players? 'No,' he says. 'I don’t get nervous for many things.' His test results were impressive, and he was noticed as the best player. 'I was very happy to hear that,' he says. But Lawrence knows he has a lot to learn. How can he join an NFL team with no experience? 'Coaches say I have the right skills. It’s about how hard I work,' he replies. Is he worried about being selected? 'I’m not worried. There’s no pressure on me,' he says. This calm attitude might come from his Olympic experience, where he came last in the final. He is proud he made it to the final with a great last throw. 'That was an amazing day,' he says. 'The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s sport. I can try again.' After the Olympics, some thought he was affected by the loss, but Lawrence doesn’t comment. An NFL player earns at least $400,000 a year, so the money is a big reason to try. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Should he focus on one sport? 'I understand why people say that,' he responds. 'I’m trying to achieve a dream I had as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work, I can go back to discus, which I love. Every decision I’ve made is planned.'"
99,B2,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, it had not yet started snowing in Siberia. I saw no sign of human life, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it these days. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and said ""Holodna"" (cold) while pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I didn't mention that my trip was self-funded and I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I was not sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to control my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since that first ride, Al had been setting himself bigger challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was his biggest so far. At times he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could handle each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong those who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,B2,"'In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns to race through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to see what it feels like to take part. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first said I was in good health, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I learned I had to stay oriented. 'The horizon is your best friend,' I was told. 'The pilot will tell you where to look.' I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were on the runway, my legs were up, feet trying not to touch the steering pedals, and hands trying not to touch any switches. My mind was made up. I would not relax and enjoy the flight. In high-speed acrobatic flying, you must stay calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. None of this comforted me as we started down the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway. We were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the world’s fastest acrobatic planes, ready to go. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. It was a quick, strong move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs on the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, aiming for the small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn’t even done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too. Then Dario said something. I asked, ‘Can you repeat that?’ But instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Yup.’ ‘Have you had enough?’ ‘No,’ I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane up and over, turning a full circle in the air. I know many people find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, as we were flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ‘Relax, relax, look up.’ I looked up and saw some fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was ‘soft’ compared to what the pilots endure when they race. To show this, Dario got out some sandwiches when we landed and happily ate. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night I dreamed of doing loops over and over again.'"
101,B2,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen amazing videos of polar bears in a nature documentary, he probably filmed them. He likes temperatures of -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, and he learned about surviving in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a world of polar bears and is very difficult to access. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very hard. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,B2,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim in very cold water and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new expedition that he says is even more challenging. Explorers are confident and determined people. They need to be. This time, there is much more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, measuring the thickness and density of the ice. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the best picture yet of how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar region. Pen was trained for this job. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tough by sending him out into blizzards and icy winds with very few clothes. His father gave him a love for frozen adventures, and Pen had unusual physical strength. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he is at home: ‘He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic.’ For fun, she once raced against him in a mountain event where riders on horseback compete against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he says. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I told my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He took it very seriously, asking his mum how she was all the time, but it was too much for him. It was well-meaning but unfair.’ For similar reasons, Pen plans to have little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending his last days before leaving preparing his equipment carefully. ‘Out on the ice, you can’t fix things easily or do anything that isn’t simple,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will have a team of six flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for someone like him, says Pen, and he is also thinking about something else. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done less training than I’d like.’ Why? ‘Organising things always seems more urgent. So I’m almost afraid of what I’m going to ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge that inspired past explorers. ‘Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,’ he admits, ‘and not very useful to anyone outside the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re trying to involve as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which seemed strange and not useful in society, are now very important. Suddenly, we’re useful again.’"
103,B2,"I had a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. These activities were great, but I missed having a big competition. I wanted to stay in shape in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but no one was interested. I knew if I joined, I would want to win. Would Ben help me win? Probably not. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat deposit, making the race possible. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete. It feels good that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I was doing something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but looking back, it was simple. I trained almost every day, but the program was set, and there were doctors and dieticians. I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I was afraid it would look like I just wanted to be on TV. My worries went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. But he couldn't row. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,B2,"'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in the far north of Finland. At 26, I was feeling restless. I was dreaming of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty spaces, maybe because of the noise and crowded life in London. So I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, deep in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, there is a lot of work taking tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow (for anything from an hour to five days). They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place – the 'wilderness farm’, which they said was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I find myself staring at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies; I am supposed to remember their names by the time I get there, but I am distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out of the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of opening flowers and leaves. I think what I am seeing, however, is the opposite, with winter moving south, and the rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forest – thin trees, covered with snow – stopping sometimes to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely through the door when I’m given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the sound of barking, which becomes very loud by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth up the lines of huskies, pulling them out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost crazy with excitement, pulling hard against the ropes to start running. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to stop and talk much anyway. I stand on the side and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command rings out, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light. November 15, Hetta It does not take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a discouraging questioning on what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m stuck. I don’t know. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned very quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in freezing conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around myself by very excited huskies. But I am happy. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,B2,"'On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that she could compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about a natural treatment, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she never really understood how big her achievement was. Looking back, she knows it was a big deal. But at the time, she felt it was just what she was going to do that day. Her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometres, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep up the pace. He thought she might have to stop the race. Hartmann was angry about this, but he understood why someone might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800m left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometres very fast and sprinted the last part in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run quicker than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would beat that time soon. Radcliffe thought she would try again next year, but it didn't happen. After the race, people wondered how she, with her awkward style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann worked with Radcliffe for weeks, helping her with the 250-300 kilometres she ran each week. He said, ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could take that level of pain. She would make me work so hard that I had to ice my thumbs afterwards.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours to her training base in France, only to be greeted with, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no time for a break. During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes were upset. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has beaten her record? ‘Not really. I trained hard, but others are more talented. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people race each other more than themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘I never relaxed, even when I was winning. I always pushed myself.’ Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was her best. She never ran as fast again. However, she inspired many women to start long-distance running.'"
106,B2,"'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, came out, I didn't know how people would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I believed our show added something new to this, but I was still worried. Would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques, but also history, memories, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my restaurant experiences. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often a real one, with travel and meeting new people. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest book, where you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best golden pasta. These people have spent years trying to reach their own idea of perfection. Perfection is different for everyone. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But after long meetings, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on their emotions, memories, and surroundings. I knew from the start that I wasn't saying the recipes were 'perfect'. But I thought that by using my skills and talking to food experts, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV series let me explore new foods, people, and places, which was exciting. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. Some adventures included visiting a factory with the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that wasn't good enough to film. I also tried new techniques, like hand-milking a cow to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down to make a pizza.'"
107,B2,"'We were still hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, went off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the front of the van. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets. He looked like he knew what he was doing. ‘Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,’ he said after a while, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field was very big. There was only grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I said, because it was always safest to agree with Bea. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John get smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay down next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’ So I told them about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. I told them about the argument they had over a worm. ‘That’s silly, no one understands bird language,’ Bea said. My eyes hurt. ‘I do.’ But my voice didn’t sound sure. ‘Liar.’ I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ‘Mum…?’ But she was asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her through the windows. We followed John into the café. It was not far from where our van was parked. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘I think it might be expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ‘It’s like syrup in there,’ she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. ‘It’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said when it got dark. Mum put blankets on the ground for us to sleep in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ‘I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,’ John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we’d get home now that our van had to be pulled everywhere. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.'"
108,B2,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like Lucy. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city. Lucy didn't hear the girl's name clearly because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. Both were about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well. They talked about the music they were playing and their travel plans. 
Lucy mentioned she might go to the Tanglewood festival in the summer. It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She often did things like concerts and competitions that took her around the world. She missed so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. Lucy hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists her age from around the world. Her mother had applied for her without telling her. 
Lucy’s dad bought her a necklace to celebrate her acceptance, and her little brother Gus dreamed of going to the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. Lucy felt her mom didn't want to give her the chance to say no to the festival. 
The guy from Tokyo was surprised when Lucy said she was going to Tanglewood. He asked her age, and she said she was fifteen. He and the girl, Liesel or Louisa, were impressed. Lucy didn't mean to show off. It was hard to know when she was just sharing information or bragging. 
Liesel or Louisa left to talk to someone else, but the guy from Tokyo stayed. He asked if Lucy had been to Japan. She said she went once when she was eight. Then, Lucy's grandfather came and took her away to introduce her to other people. He told her not to get too friendly with the competition. Lucy said they weren't the competition, but her grandfather insisted everyone was. 
Her grandfather took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she only heard about half of what was said. After the party, in the elevator, her grandfather told her she did well and that he was proud of her. He said the festival was important and that people knew who she was. Lucy liked being somebody, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care about her music skills. But in places like the festival, Lucy felt she mattered."
109,B2,"""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. He’s hard to argue with, so I decided to see what experts say – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of who they are, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is a big part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just use media for things like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do – they live in it. It’s not good or bad – it’s how you use it that matters.’ How does our social networking compare with what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like hanging out at the youth club, as today’s parents did when they were younger, to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. He says it helps teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and get along with their peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you find that self-identity: you can post about your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see that other people have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He says that using social media can help if you’re shy: ‘Talking online can be easier than face-to-face, and you can practice social skills in a less scary environment.’ Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help if you’re quiet and have a special interest because they let you connect with others who like the same things. ‘If you’re one of only three people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people who like the same thing, you can still be popular, just in a different way,’ he says. Pauline White, a digital education expert, told me something interesting: ‘It’s people your age who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people – and then create their own content – who are really using the power of social networks.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasting, and blogging about things that interest them. Photo-sharing sites, she says, are changing creativity. Keen photographers can connect with each other, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interest. ‘This all helps with getting jobs and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and to increase brand awareness – and you need to understand how it works and can create customers. For example, if you make a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they’re all potential customers for that product. If you link all those networks together, there’s your customer base.’ Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and then share it. Working together is a real 21st-century skill, and important for getting a job in a digital age.’"""
110,B2,"'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they probably don't think of a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. But my parents wanted something different for our summer vacation this year. My dad planned what many teenagers might call a nightmare: a big family trip. He and my mom kept saying, 'Not enough people do this anymore,' while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, 'There's probably a reason why!' In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With just enough space for us in the car, we started 'The Family Great American Road Trip.' As we left our big home for smaller places to stay over the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into. We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under very dark, starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cows have the right-of-way! The next day, we got up early and started driving again. I noticed a pattern. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to feel the same, but each adventure was different. We walked on the Great Sand Dunes and went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. As we climbed to our next stop, we learned that roads for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we went, we saw a mix of old and new. We got used to traffic from road construction. We laughed when we saw big 'CLOSED' signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sun set over bear habitats near the roads. 'Bear jams,' where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common. We had a close encounter with a bear on the road, which gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life at home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its problems, didn't ruin our excitement. It was a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service, but it had the most amazing views. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to a faraway place to find something special. It was both happy and sad to be home again, but at least I didn't fight with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our trip to look through. I knew I would remember the unplanned and spontaneous moments the most.'"
111,B2,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living at the college under the care of the Head. She was happy because she got the best room with a kitchen and study area, plus free Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would still watch over Amy.
Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were not excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to know her granddaughter again. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Rose was ten when she last saw her grandmother, but her memories were happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked bringing people together. Rose expected dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady and seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England.
Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, or go out without asking permission every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen phone with a video camera for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed it would be about trust. Her grandmother would trust her to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were problems, they would talk about it.
Rose was never a wild child. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and start her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this was the last time because she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed difficult. At 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. When she told her old teacher, the teacher was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn’t see why she should wait if she could be good at it now.
On a winter afternoon, I met Charlotte at her publisher's office. Even though I knew she was 15, I was surprised to see a teenager. Her book is impressive: the story is strong and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, shows it was written by a teenager. A public relations person was with us in case Charlotte needed help, but she didn’t. Charlotte is confident and smart, but also calm.
Charlotte knows she is young. I asked her about the complex issues in her book. She said, ‘I wanted to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons for my readers,’ she laughed. ‘I don’t think my age limits my understanding, but I’m not very wise either. I just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.’
Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are shown in books. She says there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who isn’t socially skilled. She found these types annoying. ‘What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who aren’t lacking in some way. Some writers unintentionally make teenagers feel they can’t know who they are because they lack experience, which can hurt their confidence.’
Charlotte loves reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ‘Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep ideas about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to do that to write a good book and if I could do it.’ She does praise a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ‘It says if the reader can guess what happens next, the suspense is gone.’
Some might think Charlotte’s parents, who are journalists, helped her get published. Her father knew someone in publishing, which helped her book get read. She knows she was lucky because getting a first novel read is hard, no matter the author’s age. ‘Every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, it’s up to your talent. I don’t take things for granted,’ Charlotte says."
113,B2,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew upwards, but something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it. If I tried to join the skateboarders, I’d risk looking silly. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes – not a real introduction to the slopes. After practising indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers just hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down again. Land in the right zone and you keep moving, which is less painful. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs would slow down as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed right. Gareth was as happy as me, and I felt proud. But that didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I didn’t slow down before the jump, landed well, but then saw both skis sliding down the slope without me."""
114,B2,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight as the ride stops and then slowly goes up. There is a pause, and then a fast drop makes your stomach feel funny. You go quickly forward, turn left, and even go upside down. Everything is a blur, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose to be there, like many others who visit theme parks every year.
Amusement parks are a big business. They have exciting rides to attract people. Behind these rides are teams of engineers and designers who work hard to make them thrilling and safe. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it is a real challenge. Designers must create rides that are fun and a bit scary, but also safe. They also need to keep coming up with new ideas to keep visitors interested.
Many people think rollercoasters are getting more intense, but most of the techniques used today were invented by John Miller in the early 20th century. Back then, rides were more extreme, but now designers have to work with what ride manufacturers offer.
I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts explained that it's about making people feel like they are being thrown around but still safe. The best rides tell a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and use new ideas like the tallest ride or the most twists to make the experience exciting.
Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trying things out are what work best. Jeff Hornick, a theme park development director, agreed that designers need to understand what passengers want and test the rides themselves.
I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add something extra, but the real rollercoaster experience will still be the most important part for many years."
115,B2,"'At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both activities in her busy schedule. ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day,’ she says. As a choreographer, she teaches and enjoys working with young students. ‘A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re willing to take risks. They want success, but they don’t know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This means they accept even harsh criticism. They might still question me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’ When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There may be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t choose a new piece. I’d like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces – it’d help lift the mood when rehearsals are tough. But now I’m always working on big productions – the music is already written and can’t be changed.’ Miranda doesn’t want to work with just one institution. ‘I think it’s important to meet new people. But I have to remember that the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to change the way I work each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’ We talk about a recent documentary on ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one tries to show what life is really like in a dance company. There was a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and I smiled because I recognized it. She knows she’s not doing it right but can’t make her body do it. It’s hard to watch but not fake for the cameras. The public doesn’t realize how much work and dedication ballet requires.’ I ask what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – comes together. Perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can cover a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. And that’s disappointing.’ Miranda has done so much work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s a trend to focus on a narrow area, too. I don’t follow that, but maybe one day I’ll be known for one thing. For now, I want to widen my horizons.’'"
