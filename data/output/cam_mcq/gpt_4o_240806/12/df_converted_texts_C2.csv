1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—announcing your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern about the downsides of sharing too much online. The internet offers vast opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we feel lost. Is this discouraging? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the risks of fame—long before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are facing now. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" then mostly used by students and scientists. The web was invented at CERN in Switzerland for researchers to share work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, attracting readers with his bold use of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was exhibitionist, his work had a discipline and beauty that could be considered art. One day, visitors found his site replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Publishing his life online, Hall realized, made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is appealing, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to company executives, including those she had mocked, leading to her dismissal. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our digital and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Though upset and taking a break from blogging, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" supporting her household with her writing. Once an example of online mistakes, she has mastered controlled self-revelation. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because the web lets us say anything, doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film combined documentary and drama to suggest that there is much about our universe that we don't understand. While scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe, some were concerned enough to publicly criticize the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film intriguing to many viewers.

Initially, the film seemed harmless, with scientists discussing how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than expected. However, the controversy arose when the film claimed that water molecules could be influenced by thoughts. It mentioned a Japanese researcher who supposedly showed that the shape of water molecules could change based on the thoughts of people nearby. The film's evidence for this was simply pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being exposed to positive thoughts and looking unpleasant after negative ones. While some people found this convincing, scientists were skeptical, demanding more substantial proof.

The real issue was that the film's claims weren't strange enough compared to actual scientific discoveries. For example, scientists have found that water molecules have properties linked to a mysterious energy that seems to drive the universe's expansion. This is supported by decades of research. Indeed, the universe is stranger than we imagined. Astronomers have discovered that it consists of unknown matter and is driven by a force called ""dark energy.""

Other scientific findings are equally fascinating. Neuroscientists have shown that our perception of events is delayed by about half a second, a delay our brains edit out. Anthropologists have identified where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest connections between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.

Science is far from complete. In fact, we are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit our understanding. Leading physicists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these efforts, many believe the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,"Text: 'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. These two activities complement each other, creating a landscape I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, attracting bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started writing, I have alternated between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories, and after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never mix the two; I don't write short stories while working on a novel and vice versa. They might use different parts of the brain, and switching takes time. I began my career with two short novels in 1975 and started writing short stories in 1984-1985. I knew little about it then, so it was tough, but memorable. It expanded my fictional world, and readers liked this side of me. One of my first works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is joyful because they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story, though revisions can be endless. It's not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. Writing a novel can feel endless, and I sometimes wonder if I'll finish. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small ideas, a word, or an image. It's like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, failure isn't a big worry. If an idea doesn't work, you move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. This is comforting. You learn from mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories' successes and failures. Short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It's hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be more difficult. My short stories are like shadows I've set in the world, footprints I've left. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are guideposts to my heart, and sharing these feelings with readers makes me happy as a writer.'"
4,"Science, at its core, can be as abstract as philosophy or as practical as curing diseases. It has both improved our lives and posed threats to our existence. Science aims to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles to fully grasp these concepts. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often only seen by experts, its dangers are misunderstood, and its importance is both exaggerated and underestimated. The mistakes of science and scientists are sometimes ignored or overly criticized. The journey to explain the universe has been marked by constant conflict. Old theories are often changed or completely overturned, much like innovations in music that are initially mocked but later become accepted. The battle between old and new ideas is rarely graceful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. Conflict is central to the history of science. This book explores science as a series of ideas that have changed not just science itself but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book focuses on ideas, appreciating their beauty and creativity, but also questioning them and recognizing the limits of human understanding. Science is always changing. Scientists are constantly challenging each other's explanations. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they lead to major shifts in our beliefs. In the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics challenged basic assumptions, showing that observing the universe affects it and that we don't fully understand our basic concepts. Some see the changing nature of scientific theories as a sign that science can't fully explain the universe. However, scientific change often leads to better understanding and prediction of nature. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science often makes mistakes but continues to progress. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was little left to discover, but then came breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, quantum mechanics, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe. Maybe. Science is not just an intellectual hobby. In the last two centuries, we have gone from observing nature to controlling it, sometimes disrupting natural balances without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists can no longer ignore scientific advances that will shape the world their children will live in and the kind of children they will have. Science is now part of how humanity plans and shapes its future. Deciding the future is not just for philosophers; these decisions can impact national budgets, the health of future generations, and even the survival of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in publishing. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the traditional printed word. Despite evidence that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books keeps coming up. Whether predicting or dismissing this idea, the potential disappearance of books continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so compelling? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. Historically, the idea of one medium replacing another has often followed new technologies. Before digital tech, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many thought radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated with movies, radio, television, and smartphones, all supposedly threatening print books. Some feared this would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the book's death often appears during technological change, reflecting our hopes and fears about such changes. We form emotional bonds with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we connect closely with objects like books, TVs, and computers, sometimes even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, new technology like e-readers doesn't just mean economic and social change; it also affects our bond with familiar things. As technology advances, we may long for what we used to know. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for silent films. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. E-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. Yet, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling story about technology's power and our resistance to change. We use familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings, to make sense of change. The story of the book's death reflects our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world, and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For nearly every weekday morning over a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds from the past four hundred years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, portraying them as creatures of habit, much like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward."" In this way, the book is somewhat superficial, focusing on the circumstances of creative activity rather than the end product. However, it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even typing a business letter reveals something of your inner self, and I find that true. 

The book addresses questions I grapple with in my own life: How can you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to dedicate yourself entirely to a project or to set aside a small part of each day? When time seems scarce, must you sacrifice things like sleep or income, or can you learn to be more efficient, to ""work smarter, not harder,"" as my dad always says? I don't claim to answer these questions definitively—some may only be resolved individually through personal compromises—but I have tried to show how various brilliant and successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to illustrate how grand creative visions translate into small daily actions and how working habits influence the work itself.

The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it really focuses on people's routines. A routine suggests ordinariness and a lack of thought, like being on autopilot. Yet, in the right hands, a routine can be a finely tuned mechanism for making the most of limited resources: time, willpower, and optimism. A solid routine creates a groove for mental energy and helps avoid being controlled by moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to free our minds for more interesting pursuits. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and couldn't stick to a regular schedule. 

Interestingly, this book was born from a moment of procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, while trying to write a story for the architecture magazine I worked for, I found myself tidying my cubicle and making coffee instead of working. As a ""morning person,"" I am focused in the early hours but less productive after lunch. To feel better about this tendency, I began searching online for information about other writers' schedules. These were easy to find and entertaining. It struck me that someone should collect these anecdotes, leading to the creation of the Daily Routines blog and eventually this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of routines I found in biographies, magazine profiles, and obituaries. For the book, I expanded and researched more thoroughly while keeping the original's brevity and variety of voices. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources. This book wouldn't have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I relied on. I have documented all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist due to an unexpected change in his childhood. When he was six, his father canceled a planned holiday to Spain because of rising interest rates. Instead, they went to the English coast, where Howard found an ammonite on the beach. This discovery sparked his lifelong interest in palaeontology. By the end of university, Howard knew he wanted to study the earliest forms of life, not dinosaurs. He focused on ancient, delicate fossils.

After finishing his doctoral thesis, Howard worried about finding a job. He was confident in his abilities but knew that getting a position in academia could be unpredictable. When a job at Tavistock College in London opened, he applied, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to support another candidate couldn't attend due to an accident. His replacement, who disliked the absent professor, helped Howard get the job instead. Howard was initially grateful, but later learned the truth. He was slightly disappointed but relieved to have the job he wanted.

Howard often compared the structured nature of his work with the unpredictability of life. He experienced this unpredictability firsthand when his briefcase, containing lecture notes, was stolen at an Underground station. Frustrated, he postponed the lecture and went for coffee, where he met a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This meeting led to an opportunity to study a new fossil collection, which became his greatest challenge and secured his professional future. The theft, though inconvenient, turned out to be a blessing. Howard quickly changed his plans, deciding not to attend a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he focused on visiting the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. In his office at Oxford University, he mentions having ice cream made from bee larvae at home. Despite their maggot-like appearance, they have a 'slightly nutty, floral' taste. Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are addressing. Through his research on how our senses combine to create our perception of flavor, Spence is subtly influencing what we eat and drink. His work impacts both large food companies and top restaurant menus. Spence and his colleagues, through a field known as gastrophysics, examine in detail how we experience food and drink. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates, and background noise all affect taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-authored with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers intriguing insights for anyone who enjoys eating. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant tends to enjoy their meal the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence's lab in Oxford is quite basic. He describes it as 'low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff.' There are soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can collaborate creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. Historically, research funded by industry was seen as less prestigious in universities. However, since universities now need to show their work has an impact, this type of research is more valued. Spence is currently helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often due to government regulations. Brands do this gradually so consumers don't notice the change. 'Research shows that if you tell people about the changes, they focus on the taste and don't like it as much,' he explains. Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a major food producer. At the time, people thought science and food didn't mix, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal and Spence collaborated on the 'Sound of the Sea' dish at Blumenthal's restaurant. Interestingly, early 20th-century Italian futurists tried similar ideas, like pairing frog sounds with frog legs, but it didn't catch on. Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. His research shows that high-pitched music enhances sweetness, while low-pitched sounds make food taste bitter. 'It's surprising when shapes affect taste, or when music changes how you perceive flavor,' he says. An airline will soon match music with in-flight meals. Last year, a brand released an app that played music while ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says is common. One wonders what dinner parties are like at Spence's home. They've eaten rabbit with fur-wrapped cutlery and used remote-controlled lights. They've also experimented with sound and drinks to see if different pitches affect taste. For Spence, home, shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, pseudo facts, chatter, and rumours, all pretending to be information. We must sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. Meanwhile, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we handle most things on our own. We juggle the roles of many people while managing our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows, with the help of our smartphones. These devices are part of the 21st-century trend of filling every spare moment. However, there's a problem. We believe we are multitasking, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, explains that our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching tasks quickly, which has a cognitive cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, switching tasks frantically and worrying about dropping one. Ironically, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can overstimulate the brain and cause mental fog. Multitasking creates a craving for distraction, rewarding the brain for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, the brain area we rely on to stay focused, is easily distracted by new things. Just the chance to multitask harms cognitive performance. Glenn Wilson, a former Visiting Professor of Psychology at Gresham College, London, calls this info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an unread email sits in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. Wilson found that the cognitive losses from multitasking are greater than those from fatigue. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, discovered that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework while watching TV, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, instead of the hippocampus, which organizes facts and ideas for easy retrieval. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is taxing on the brain. Small decisions use the same resources as big ones, leading to a depleted state where we might make poor decisions. In discussions with business leaders, scientists, and writers, email is often mentioned as a problem. It's not the email itself, but the overwhelming volume of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son once said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which was not far from the truth. We feel obliged to reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and accomplish other tasks."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions would have been seen as irrelevant. Animals had behaviors, these behaviors produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. The idea that animals have consciousness, feelings, and moral systems was considered sentimental. But recently, this view has partially changed. Research into the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has led to the exploration of animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". It has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness? This debate leads to another, less abstract one: not about consciousness, but conscience – a moral sense of right and wrong. In a recent experiment with cows that had to open a locked gate to get food, those that opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure – by jumping and kicking – than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for beef production and consumption? The observations may not be disputed, but their interpretation is. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the verge of a major ethical revolution. Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, suggests we should re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. He believes animals have a simpler theory of mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail argues we should stop anthropomorphizing. The three may never agree because the issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Given that defining consciousness is nearly impossible, can we ever know, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asks, what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an experiment he did that seems to show starlings – a type of bird – can get depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. Half were in luxurious cages with plenty of space and water, while the other half were in small, barren cages. Initially, both groups were fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and soon learned to take only from the tasty box. But when offered only unpleasant worms, only the birds in luxurious cages would eat. Balcombe concluded that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. ‘We look back with horror on an era of racism,’ he says. ‘Our view about animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.’ If he were the only advocate of this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his view. Manning has written a textbook, ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" ‘What we are seeing is a pendulum swing,’ he says. ‘At the turn of the 20th century, some assumed animals thought like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are going the other way. But it is a contentious subject, and you want to avoid the sound of academics with personal grievances and strong opinions.’"
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, involves engaging deeply with what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K. and a former computer science lecturer, notes that argument is often seen as a way to find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there is concern that it changes how we solve complex problems, making deep thinking harder. West points out that we are bombarded with poor yet appealing ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our reasoning. Interestingly, more data doesn't necessarily lead to better knowledge or decisions. Despite this, the quality of our thinking hasn't changed much.

The National Endowment for the Arts reports a decline in literary reading, which some, like Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believe affects critical thinking. She suggests that focusing on visual media reduces critical thinking because it emphasizes multitasking over concentrating on one thing. However, there is no clear answer on how technology impacts critical thinking. Technology's influence is complex, and its effects vary. For instance, a computer game might enhance or hinder critical thinking. Reading online can improve analytical skills, but constantly clicking links might prevent deeper thought.

Greenfield, who reviewed over 50 studies on learning and technology, says that visual media have changed how we think. Reading fosters imagination and critical thinking, unlike video games and TV. Yet, visual media can improve some information processing skills. Unfortunately, most visual media don't allow time for reflection or imagination, leading to underachievement, especially among young people.

Society's view of technology shapes its perception of critical thinking. This is evident in the debate over video games and cognition. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games can be valuable learning tools, despite concerns about their impact on children. Evidence shows that games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in realistic settings. These games allow exploration of ideas that might be otherwise inaccessible.

In the digital age, as reading and math scores decline, it's crucial to examine technology's impact on thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford, when not writing about how we should live, works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy institutions. His first book praised the benefits of manual work, while his latest book is a philosophical guide on dealing with modern life. Crawford was inspired to write it after noticing ads on a credit card machine while entering his pin. He realized that these constant demands on our attention are hard to avoid. Deciding what to focus on is personal, yet we are often unaware of how external factors influence us. This makes it harder to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people isolate themselves and avoid simple interactions like chatting with strangers. Crawford notes that we experience the world through representations like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us and take over our desires. This concern is shared by many, as seen in office workers who complain about emails but spend their free time on them. Studies show our attention wanders if a phone is visible, a common experience at dinners. While there's no scientific proof that our attention spans have shortened, we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford believes the issue isn't just technological; technology has become a tool for our self-obsession. Constant choices strain our self-control and affect society. We prefer texting friends to avoid conversations. By interacting with representations of people instead of real people, we risk losing something essential in society. Screens are only part of the problem. Crawford uses his gym as an example. It used to have one music player for everyone, which could cause tension. Now, people listen to their own music with earbuds, making the gym less social. Genuine connections often happen through conflict, like resolving different tastes. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, regulate noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, engage in skilled practices for a more fulfilling connection with the world. He cites cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who engage with reality. No representation can match the feel of a hockey puck on ice or gravel under tires. These roles require good judgment and managing others in the same space. Engaging with the world this way reveals manufactured experiences as poor substitutes for real involvement. This doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but it's important to use your judgment. Besides professional satisfaction, focusing on one thing helps you focus on others, while resisting distractions is tiring."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, it's easy to answer, but for a philosopher like me, it's a bit tricky. Calling oneself a philosopher can sound pretentious. People might think it means having special access to truth or wisdom, which is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else, but this stereotype persists. Why? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others' actions and value intellectual life. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, believed that a life of contemplation was the most virtuous. While few modern philosophers agree, philosophy is still linked to intellectual life. Socrates, another Greek philosopher, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living,’ meaning that blindly following cultural norms is unsatisfying. Reflecting on life helps us make our own decisions. However, examining life doesn't require reading philosophical classics or living in deep thought. It means looking closely at daily experiences to see if they deserve their importance. It doesn't have to be a life away from society. In fact, examining life is practical and involves sharing knowledge, which is key to a good life. Another reason for the misconception about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from everyday life, especially for those without formal training. This isn't entirely philosophers' fault. University funding and evaluations focus on expensive, hard-to-access journals, leaving little chance for philosophers to share ideas beyond their field. To outsiders, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. While philosophers once challenged this view, many now accept it. The university system created this isolation, and academics have supported it. As debates become more technical, explaining them to non-experts is difficult. Philosophy, in some areas, has withdrawn from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which evaluates human actions. But this title feels limited because ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. Recently, ethics has come to mean applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if actions are ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often explore them. But philosophy is more than that. A discussion might start with whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then explore responsibility, attitudes towards art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people examine the practices and behaviors that shape their lives. Sometimes it confirms what we know; other times, it challenges our beliefs. Either way, examining these ideas benefits everyone."""
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies, gourmands, and chefs, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. Historically, though, philosophers have often used food as a way to discuss other topics. When philosophers talked about eating, it was usually a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food actually explore other, loosely related ideas. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus promoted seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is now closely linked with a love for eating and drinking, seen in restaurant names and food websites. These businesses likely hope to benefit from being associated with a famous philosopher. Food is inherently social and cultural. It comes from historical contexts and is shared within communities, which provide dining companions and the systems for growing and distributing food. We interact with food more often and in more essential ways than any other commodity, making it a significant topic for philosophical study. Once food is prepared, critics discuss and write about it. But why do they have such a special status? One philosopher noted that tasting food is not a unique skill; influential critics are just better at describing tastes. Philosophically, the mechanisms of taste perception have been overlooked, with most research focusing on vision. This needs to change. Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We often describe paintings or music as beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that modern gastronomy has earned food a place in aesthetic discussions, like sculpture or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike art or music, which lasts over time. This makes it difficult to consider food as an object of aesthetic value. There are many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices. Discussing these topics is important in relation to food. Another issue is the difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of personal relationships. In home kitchens, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional cooks have obligations to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are only open to qualified people, and their relationships are professional. An essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by appreciating others' food and by forming personal bonds through shared meals, a practice with a long history in diplomacy. The essay includes many examples and stories, making this aspect of food philosophy engaging for readers.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, an American game designer, creates 'legacy' board games. He found traditional board games from his childhood less engaging and started thinking about how they could evolve. Could they have a storyline? Could decisions from one game affect the next? He transformed the classic game Risk into Risk Legacy, a 'legacy' version where decisions have lasting effects. Players might tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules. These games unfold over several sessions, with past actions influencing future gameplay. Daviau said, ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau then worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular cooperative game about curing diseases. His next project was SeaFall, a game set in the age of sail, where players explore and conquer new lands. Unlike Pandemic Legacy, SeaFall was the first original legacy game, not based on an existing version. Legacy game designers must anticipate all player choices to keep the story intact. They use testers to see how games develop. Jaime Barriga, a SeaFall tester, said, ‘It takes an insane amount of time. Sometimes it’s great at first, but then it breaks, and you have to start over.’

Legacy games were not expected to become mainstream. Daviau thought they would appeal to a niche audience. ‘I thought I would be known as the guy who did this weird project,’ he said. However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the concept. He sees it as a major advancement in game design, offering a new level of commitment and excitement. Ben Hogg, another fan, said the unfolding adventure outweighed concerns about the game's longevity. ‘It’s like buying an experience, similar to video games,’ he said.

The legacy format draws inspiration from video games and episodic TV series. Daviau, who once wanted to be a TV writer, found storytelling appealing. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need a clear start and end, but also more than just an outline,’ he said. While Daviau feels a sense of ownership, he is curious about others' contributions to the idea. Yet, he downplays its importance, predicting gamers will soon seek something new. Colby Dauch, from SeaFall's publisher, believes the legacy format has changed perceptions of what board games can be."
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children's movie, was widely shared online. Stories like this, involving animals such as rats and llamas, often amuse us because we like to imagine animals behaving like humans. This is especially true for octopuses, whose intelligence is surprising given their different bodies. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

While anthropomorphism, or attributing human traits to animals, is often seen as unscientific, Dr. Frans de Waal argues that the real issue is ""anthropodenial""—the refusal to acknowledge human-like traits in animals. He has studied animal cognition and found that animals, except for fully-developed language, show many behaviors once thought unique to humans, such as empathy, self-awareness, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.

De Waal believes anthropodenial is a modern idea. In medieval and early modern Europe, animals were considered intelligent enough to be put on trial. In the nineteenth century, naturalists, including Charles Darwin, explored the connections between human and animal intelligence. Darwin noted that the difference between humans and higher animals is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, behaviorism, which focused on conditioning animals with rewards and punishments, changed public views. Animals were seen as machines or robots with instincts, and thinking of them as having inner lives was dismissed as unscientific. This view coincided with humans destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.

De Waal is optimistic that we are moving past this view and recognizing animal cognition as similar to human cognition, though not identical. He notes the growing knowledge about animal intelligence shared online. Effective tests of animal intelligence consider a species' unique traits. For example, squirrels excel at remembering where they hide nuts, while humans need apps to find lost phones. In her book, ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might judge us on our ability to change skin color patterns, and find us lacking.

De Waal doubts Inky's escape was as planned as it seems, but he acknowledges that viral stories can increase appreciation for animal intelligence. He once tested whether capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys received cucumbers and others got grapes, the cucumber-receivers were upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video clip of the experiment, released later, convinced more people of the findings. This highlights the unique nature of the human mind."
17,"Text: 'Once only found in science fiction, robotics is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialisation. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for years, but experts now predict a big increase in their use across many industries. However, many countries are not ready for this change. While most people agree that robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, 80% believe their own jobs will remain unchanged. This belief is misleading, as robotic automation will affect every industry soon. For instance, the Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a task that would take two human workers much longer. Similarly, the startup Simbe Robotics in San Francisco introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to ensure products are stocked and priced correctly. Supporters of robotic automation point out that robots still need humans to service and program them, which could create new skilled jobs. Critics, however, warn that we are not ready for the loss of human interaction in the workplace. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robotics is changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will create laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but there will be a shortage of skilled workers. Zhang suggests that people should retrain to adapt to these changes, as relying on the government to protect jobs is not realistic. Advances in technology will also lead to new types of robots for consumers, like those that live in our homes and interact with us. This presents opportunities for businesses but also challenges, such as the need for new safety and privacy regulations. With many jobs at risk, education is crucial to prepare for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, reportedly answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" The reporter's question reflected a common curiosity: why would anyone engage in such a dangerous and seemingly pointless activity? Mallory's answer might inspire some to pursue their dreams, challenging them to face the unknown. Its true value lies in its simplicity, suggesting that adventure and fun might be the only reasons for climbing.

An important essay on climbing is ""Games Climbers Play"" (1967) by Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores. He identified seven different climbing activities, or ""games,"" each with its own rules, from bouldering to scaling Himalayan peaks. He argued that the style of climbing, such as using more or less equipment, should follow the rules of the specific game. Over the years, this approach has influenced climbing discussions in the West, from magazines to debates.

For many climbers, the love of climbing comes from the sense of freedom it provides. However, climbing can also be restrictive, like being stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and confining. Yet, the limited choices in climbing can bring a simplicity that is a form of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen, in a recent essay, suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He offers an evolutionary perspective, saying climbing is in our genes. It's natural for humans to take on challenges and test limits, even with risks. Thus, the joy of climbing is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor, in another essay, argues that climbing helps develop virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these traits, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing can help cultivate qualities that are valuable in everyday life.

Another perspective is that climbers who rely solely on themselves, without help from others or technology, must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred controversy by claiming that independent climbs deserve more recognition than those aided by teams or technology, like bottled oxygen. Their essay may have encouraged some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Exploring climbing beyond the Western view, climbers often describe being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, meditative focus, and intuitive problem-solving are key aspects of climbing. Some argue that climbing parallels Zen techniques for achieving mental peace. This offers another perspective on why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, pianist Alfred Brendel established and maintained a leading role in classical music. Known as an intellectual and sometimes serious figure, he focused on European piano works. He wrote and performed extensively but rarely taught. Those close to him saw a playful side, but it was rarely shown in his concerts. His life was a disciplined cycle of study, travel, and performance. Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel backstage at a concert, asking for lessons. Initially, Brendel was hesitant. He had few students and saw no reason to start teaching now. He quoted another famous pianist: ""You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk."" However, something about Kit, then around 14, caught his attention. After hearing him play, Brendel said, ""He played remarkably well and from memory. He gave me a CD of a recital where he played so beautifully that I thought, 'I have to make time for him.' It was a performance that guided you from the first to the last note. It's rare to find a musician with such an overview and subtlety."" As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is gradually entering it, with Brendel cautious about him burning out early. Kit, now 19, is restless and impatient outside lessons, always learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under his mother's watchful eye. He also composes music. Brendel says, ""This is very important. Learning to read music is helped by trying to write something yourself. I noticed Kit has a phenomenal memory and is an excellent sight reader. More importantly, he listens to his own playing, is sensitive to sound, and listens to me when I explain something. He not only understands what I mean but can do it. When I tell him something in a piece, he applies it throughout the piece."" Brendel pauses and looks serious. ""I don't want to raise expectations. I'm upset when newspapers do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century. It's the worst thing. You don't say that in a newspaper. It has caused harm. Like many gifted young players, he can play some things amazingly well, while others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic expected the greatest perfection."" Now at 80, Brendel shows a softer side in his post-performing years. He explains, ""When I was young, I didn't want to be famous in five years, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By 50, I had done most of them, but there was room for more, so I continued. Although I don't have the physical strength now, in my mind, there are always things happening, pieces I've never played. I don't play now, but it's a nice new career."""
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden wasn’t in a dirty city; it was by a river and sloped gently towards the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places of escape, peace, and solitude. Grandad’s garden wasn’t special in terms of features. He didn’t have a greenhouse, unlike some neighbors who made theirs from old window frames. They patched them with plastic when glass broke.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved, but he wasn’t without humor. He enjoyed using phrases like ‘It’s immaterial to me’ instead of simply saying ‘I don’t mind’. He probably felt disappointed for not achieving more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn’t passionate about. He wasn’t very ambitious, though he and Mum once considered moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was skilled at home repairs, like building bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother often changed the furniture. Just as we got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I only liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; lessons were for my sister. When I asked my mother later why I wasn’t given the chance, she said, ‘You’d never have practised’.

Given the choice of moors, woods, or river, I usually chose the river. I would explore with a fishing net, wearing sandals with the fronts cut out to fit my growing feet. I’d find a spot to leave my sandals and picnic, then wade into the water, looking for fish to catch and take home. After failing to keep them alive, I’d return them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father mentioned a job opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. He thought I might be interested. Although he might have preferred me to become a carpenter, I like to think he believed things might work out if I pursued gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw my passion for it and hoped it would lead to something good."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches on the Isle of Muck, a small Scottish island, and I do the same. An Atlantic storm threatens to blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. Despite the fierce wind, MacEwen remains calm and at ease on his island. He introduces me to his surroundings, pointing out nearby islands. ""That’s Eigg,"" he shouts over the wind, ""and to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do."" I see rain clouds over Rum's mountains. ""Beyond Rum is Soay,"" he adds. 

As rain approaches, MacEwen says he needs to move his sheep, and we head down the slopes. He tells me about the island: Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide, its geese eat a lot of grass, and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Our conversation pauses as we watch Tie, his sheepdog, try to herd sheep. ""Away to me, Tie,"" MacEwen instructs, but the dog causes confusion instead. ""That will never do,"" MacEwen says, disappointed.

The Isle of Muck is mainly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence manages the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin looks after the cottages; and their daughter Mary, with her husband Toby, runs the island hotel, Port Mor. Mary and Toby enjoy that their children can explore the island freely. ""They come back only when they’re hungry,"" Mary says. However, island life has its challenges, like limited electricity. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to come on, and the next morning, Mary prepares breakfast by torchlight. I adapt to this, along with the lack of mobile phone service. ""There’s reception on the hill,"" Mary tells me, but most people give up after a few days. I do the same.

Life on Muck feels wonderfully unusual. The boat today brings groceries and three musicians, who perform a lively concert in the tearoom. That night, by the fire, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on Soay without seeing it, and Jenny was sent to manage it, despite only having typing skills. I fall asleep to the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. I enjoy meals made from local produce. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish, which I bring back for dinner. It’s delicious.

The next morning, I’m supposed to take a ferry to another island. However, many ferries have been canceled recently due to rough seas. If mine doesn’t come, I’ll be on Muck for two more days, which I secretly hope for, phone or no phone."
22,"Text: 'The game design industry was once mainly for computer scientists and self-taught individuals, with few entry paths. It was often seen as just a hobby for young enthusiasts, but now the video games industry is taken seriously. Industry experts are not surprised by this change. Creating video game spin-offs for new movies requires large teams and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it's hard to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says: ‘It’s tough to make progress in big companies or influence major games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever, not just directors but also those who design systems and set pieces.’ How can you enter this competitive field? While many companies prefer a computer science degree, Jim disagrees. ‘The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You need to create something to get a job or succeed independently. Game design is more a lifestyle than a job. Like any creative work, it must be practiced to be real.’ Another expert, John Field, offers more options. ‘Just doing it is important, but it’s more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet industry standards; even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and entrepreneurial spirit needed for this evolving medium.’ Can you succeed alone? ‘Maybe, but it’s difficult,’ says John. ‘A good postgraduate course in games can help, offering support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all entertainment media and have a strong interest in arts and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited by the future of games and understand its growing diversity. Networking is also crucial. To advance in games, as in many fields, you need connections.’ The stereotype of a teenage boy playing games has been replaced by a view of games as a mature medium. Families often play on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. ‘Games are popular with large audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this area expanding with new possibilities and opportunities.’"
23,"Text: 'Since I was a child, all I ever wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me, but he didn't force it on me, and I'm thankful for that. I had a friend who used to join us at the park, but his dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and never played football again. I'm glad that didn't happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It's only through practice that you can score spectacular goals. The best players in the world, who have incredible natural talent, wouldn't have achieved what they have without years of practice. Sometimes you see young players crashing into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I emphasize enjoying learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We're already trying to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope his habit of kicking them around doesn't mean he's like me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so some of us younger players could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never told us, 'This is your big chance,' but we knew it was. Although I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a well-known TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely a lot on close friends and family. But having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. People sometimes say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' Of course, I've helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong and would be offended by the idea of being on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to make things easier for those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I plan to take a year off, maybe longer, to do things I haven't been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured.'"
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. Out of desperation, he offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father couldn’t write anything sellable in Los Angeles, and Sam risked losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn’t popular with day-trippers. The road was unappealing, and the nearby resort of La Carmella was more attractive for those with some money. Only those who were broke or loved surfing would venture the last mile to Reef Point. But with the hot weather, the place became lively with people. After months of solitude, we were surrounded by activity. My father was busy trying to meet a script deadline and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and Rusty, my dog, for company. When we first arrived at Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to adopt us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I gave him water, and my father half-heartedly threw a boot at him. Rusty knew he was welcome and stayed. I asked my father, ""Who do you think he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us."" My father replied, ""You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him."" Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver the script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and seemed tireless. One surfer stood out with her graceful style. She decided to finish for the day and rode a final wave to shore. ""Hi,"" she said, ""why didn’t you join us?"" ""I haven’t got a surfboard."" ""You could get one."" ""No money."" ""You’re British, aren’t you? Visiting?"" ""No, I live here."" ""Is your father American?"" ""No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he wrote."" ""No kidding? Have I heard of him? What’s his name?"" ""Rufus Marsh."" ""You mean, Tall as the Morning?"" I nodded. ""I read that cover to cover."" She looked at me with new interest, and I realized this always happened. People were friendly but not truly interested until I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long queue at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie, who often traveled, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this time the advice was wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers explained there was a 'breakdown in the computer system,' causing frustration among the passengers. Many felt they had paid a lot for this trip and were disappointed by the delay.

Violet considered leaving but realized she had lost her phone, which was more troubling than the wait. She couldn't contact the taxi company to check if she left it there because all her important numbers were stored in the phone. Her son Harry had always warned her about relying too much on her phone. She borrowed a phone from a friendly couple in the queue to call Harry, leaving a message for him to ask their neighbor Kristina to look for her phone in her flat. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York.

Eventually, the queue moved, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her spirits dropped further when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be grand, with fake walnut panels, chandeliers, and airport-style carpets. She took the elevator, crowded with tired passengers, to her room on the twelfth floor. Thankfully, it had the balcony she had requested. She had paid extra to ensure a sea view, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"When John Maloof bid on a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he discovered 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing striking images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent morning, Maloof stood among these items, realizing he had stumbled upon something remarkable by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ For some time, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together Maier’s life story. They contacted local families who employed her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, known for being private and somewhat eccentric, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although not sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and engage people, some of whom she interviewed on audiotape. She seemed passionate about her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was created for commercial reasons. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and the abstract. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or was she a lifter of ideas from those who came before her?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof began taking his own pictures. ‘As I progressed as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often hints at some failure. However, this is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when the book's success had made her very popular, yet she remained calm, especially since she was still in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the official, who then asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in 1860s New Zealand. A series of crimes have occurred, and a group of 12 men gathers to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton said she intended to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. At over 800 pages, it is ‘big by necessity’ because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters ‘a decent show’. When I ask how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she responds modestly. ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels the success is partly theirs. There’s a very familial feeling at home; I got a lot of back pats from other people’s grandmas.’ Then she adds, carefully: ‘What is annoying is when people assume that what I’m trying to do in the book is not a philosophical enterprise.’ ‘I had the idea to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part was half the length of the one before it,’ said Catton. It literally speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters whether the reader notices these things. ‘I wanted to create a book with structural patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them.’ Despite the experimental structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with an engaging plot. Surprisingly, she says she didn’t plan it all out beforehand. ‘I would try to write myself into a corner and then see how imaginative I could be in writing myself out of it.’ It’s clear she also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We also discuss her love of TV drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue, I ask if she might be interested in screenwriting. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says. Her conversation is full of enthusiasm, with a low, conspiratorial laugh. She lights up when talking about her craft and New Zealand. ‘I always notice when I come to Britain how much the landscape of my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to crowded areas, to have that saturation of other human beings.’ But for now, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I am not alone in hoping it provides her with the inspiration she needs for many other novels."
28,"As a child, Jonny Kinkead loved two things: using tools in his dad’s garage and playing the guitar. These interests have shaped his career for the last forty years, as he builds steel-string acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still fascinated by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood create such a beautiful sound? And how do different types of wood make different sounds? It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. By sixteen, he wanted to play the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a job and save up for one,’ he says. ‘But I believed in making things myself. I studied guitars to understand how their shapes and wood types affected sound and how to build them.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny made from scratch, but he and his brothers had been building other things for a while. ‘We designed and built model boats and planes, so I knew the process. My father taught us to use tools like saws and chisels. I also repaired instruments for friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar was a success, but he hadn’t considered a career in guitar-making. ‘I was also interested in painting and sculpture,’ he says. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and it seemed like a good career choice,’ he recalls. However, he left halfway through the course. ‘I was too individualistic,’ he says. ‘But I realized I wanted to build guitars. It’s like sculpting sound, and it seemed more practical than pure art because people use them.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. Initially, he sold guitars for the cost of materials, but as his reputation grew, he could charge more. Even now, nearly forty years later, Jonny says he’s ‘still just getting by.’ He admits he can only make about ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to get noticed. He attended music festivals to let musicians try his guitars and spread the word. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which didn’t come naturally to him. Jonny believes it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought only American-made acoustic guitars were worth having,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as authentic, even though we’ve always had good courses and skills here. But now, our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says valuable techniques can be learned in classes, and he encourages new instrument-makers to take courses. However, he also believes there’s no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny advises. ‘If you make the back too thin or thick, it won’t sound good. Being taught by someone else shows you one way, but teaching yourself, like I did, means you learn everything.’"
29,"Text: 'Any discussion about English conversation must start with the weather. This is a tradition, and like many others, I will quote Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist, who said, ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This observation is still true today. However, many writers stop here or try to explain why English people are 'obsessed' with the weather, but they often fail. They mistakenly think that these conversations are genuinely about the weather. They assume English people talk about the weather because they are interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson notes that English weather is not exciting, so the obsession seems strange: ‘To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it. All those phenomena that elsewhere give nature an edge of excitement, unpredictability and danger – tornadoes, monsoons, raging blizzards, huge hailstorms – are almost wholly unknown in the British Isles.’ English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson and argues that English weather is interesting because of its unpredictability. ‘Bryson misses the point. The English fixation with the weather is nothing to do with deep emotion – like the English countryside, it is, for the most part, dramatically undramatic. The interest is less in the phenomena themselves but in its uncertainty…one of those things you can say about England with absolute certainty is that it has a lot of weather. It may not include tropical cyclones, but life at the edge of an ocean and the edge of a continent means you can never be entirely sure what you are going to get.’ My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the point. Our weather conversations are not really about the weather: they are a code to help English people talk to each other. Phrases like ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ or ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ are not requests for weather information. They are greetings, conversation starters, or fillers. English weather-speak is like ‘grooming talk’ – similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially. There are specific situations where weather-speak is used. Some writers say the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is not true. There are three main contexts: as a greeting, as an ice-breaker, or as a filler when conversation stops. This does mean there is a lot of weather-speak, so outsiders think English people talk about nothing else. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, use weather-speak to break the ice, and return to it when needed. This is why people from other countries, and even some English writers, think English people are obsessed with the weather.'"
30,"Alice Leader stood before the remains of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds the impressive engineering feat by the Romans, who built a structure 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were already interested, having chosen this trip over more glamorous destinations like Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about the purpose of the Wall, and Alice felt her explanations were lacking. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to provide context and human interest about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from a 31-year teaching career, Alice began a new path as an author in 2001. Despite her successful teaching career, Alice felt she was venturing into the unknown. She compared teaching to acting, describing it as a daily performance that is physically demanding. Writing, on the other hand, was exciting and less exhausting. Her former colleagues envied her because she remained connected to children through her fiction. Alice's main goal for her novels is to fill a gap in children's literature. She noted that much of today's adolescent fiction focuses on negative experiences or is entirely fantastical, like Harry Potter. Her books aim to be different. Alice always taught English and History as interconnected subjects, using novels like the Tale of Troy alongside lessons about ancient Greece. She is driven by her love for children and the moment they transition from boredom to interest and from confusion to understanding. She views her writing as an extension of teaching. Although the idea for her first novel arose from a market gap, it was also influenced by her sons leaving home and a suggestion from her head teacher to attend a creative writing course. Initially hesitant, Alice was surprised by the recommendation. She had to submit her best piece of fiction to be accepted into the course, a requirement she discovered just days before it started. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their unborn child, which was accepted immediately. During the course, her peers praised her work and encouraged her to publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as evidence of her writing skills, she requested a year off from her school to write her first novel. Alice's husband, Zachary Leader, a critic and editor, played a crucial role in editing her novel. Alice remarked that while her mother-in-law saw them as rival authors, she believed they complemented each other. Zachary helped refine her writing by suggesting changes to sentence structure and wording, while Alice focused on adding scenes, highlighting the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to participate in a unique race. This race would pit man against car and brother against brother. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same destination. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. ""I’m looking forward to it,"" Jonny said at the start line. ""I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold right now, so I’ll be able to stay warm in the car."" Alistair was just as eager, though he wore full winter cycling gear, unlike Jonny's jeans and sweatshirt. The cold didn’t affect his confidence. ""To be honest,"" he said, ""I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up."" The race began at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to end at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, about 350 meters up. This was no problem for the car, but Alistair’s first few miles involved a steep 25 percent incline, making it challenging from the start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading up a hill and then across the countryside to Fleet Moss, while Jonny jumped in the car and hit the road. The next time they would see each other would be at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first? Jonny’s early confidence was quickly shaken. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he encountered his first obstacle: a giant tractor moving onto the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he complained to the cameraman in his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it’s all because of this farmer!"" After tense moments, Jonny was back on track, driving into the morning mist. Meanwhile, Alistair struggled with the slope. Just a couple of miles in, he had to dismount and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep watched as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the summit. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out, he had a chance to show his skills. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair picked up speed. In the car, Jonny faced another local challenge. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have existed long before cars, and the roads were not made for speed. Jonny carefully navigated a narrow corner and passed through a stream on the road. Once clear of the last village, he raced straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final stretch to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping, he reached the line with a squeal of brakes. Alistair looked up and asked the waiting crowd, ""Is he here?"" When they said no, he raised his arms in victory. Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car and stepped out. ""Well done,"" Jonny said, clearly disappointed. ""I’m gutted."""
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a cocoon from the outside world. The quiet helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hardest to focus only on the contest and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but as if from far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused that I forget millions are watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my lifelong coach, taught me early on that this was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost twice, both times against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The 2006 defeat wasn’t so hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer beat me easily, more easily than if I’d believed in myself more. But losing in 2007 left me devastated. I knew I could have done better; it wasn’t my ability that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and waste it. Toni, a tough coach, rarely comforts me; he criticizes even when I win. But seeing how upset I was, he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might have been my last chance. I know how short a professional athlete’s career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more, and I let a big one pass in 2007. Toni couldn’t ease my grief, but he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just a year later. I was confident I’d learned from that defeat; this time, my mindset wouldn’t fail me. The best sign was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family, friends, and team members the night before the final, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t forbid it, but they knew I was already playing the match in my mind. Until the start of play, that space was mine alone.'"
33,"A young, idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in April 1957. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" She spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society helped make her famous by producing articles and documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. However, her celebrity might have overshadowed her real achievements. Many articles and books about her life focus on her adventurous spirit, her privileged background, or her role as a feminist, which can undervalue her work. Based on academic references to her research, the success of her students, and the data from her 40-year study, Jane Goodall should be seen as a pioneering zoologist. Her main achievement is that she opened the door to understanding the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees.

Before Goodall's work, chimpanzees were seen as dangerous, and their behaviors were misunderstood. No one knew they ate meat or used tools. We didn't realize they shared emotions with humans or had social systems like ours. We also didn't know that chimpanzee communities had different cultural traditions. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her study in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements, according to biologist Stephen Jay Gould.

Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives. Even as a child, she showed signs of her future career. At five years old, in 1939, she disappeared one afternoon. After a search, she reappeared with straw in her hair. She explained that she had hidden in a henhouse for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity foreshadowed her career as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford speaks to me using the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to viewers of children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computerised employee programmes about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.’ Shirley discusses what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors, even well-known ones, think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it than that. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a standard acting career. During the course, she occasionally sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon soundtrack. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, surprisingly, got a major part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and endless forms, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes everything from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound enthusiastic about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and cheery. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a huge difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that specialize in helping voiceover artists put them together.’ She claims to have reached the top of her profession through persistence as much as natural ability. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or simply practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone considering a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a dream job for many kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more practical careers, like becoming a tax lawyer or working in auto parts manufacturing. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems unrealistic. Yet, some people do just that. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. In my case, I had a typical cartoonist's childhood, loving comic strips and drawing for school publications. I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my illustrations to various companies. I was fortunate to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons on local issues. I created some ideas, they bought them, and within a few months, I was earning enough to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical barriers are low, but it's still a challenging job. No one should try to become a cartoonist unless they feel they can't do anything else. It's easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don't turn down work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don't particularly want. It helps to be intelligent, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of cartooning? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular work with newspapers and magazines, but those days are fading. Today, cartooning is mostly an entrepreneurial activity, meaning you have to create and sell your work. The more comfortable you are with this, the better you'll do. I've seen cartoonists with average talent and great business skills succeed more than artistic geniuses who lack business sense. It's surprising how many people fear their ideas will be stolen, even if they've never sold a cartoon. Some are so worried they won't let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a 'c' for 'copyright,' circle it, and write your name and the date. But realistically, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it might not be a disaster—it could be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving house and decided to clear out some things. Among them was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday: a sleek, black, Japanese-made model. Despite my usual reluctance to throw things away, I decided to discard it. At the rubbish dump, just as I was about to throw it away, a young man approached me, surprised. ""You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?"" he asked. I admitted I was, already feeling a hint of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I agreed. We parted ways, but I felt a deep regret for years afterward.

Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. The email was from Keith Rushton, a guitar dealer and restorer. He wrote, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had changed hands several times since the young man took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back, which my dad had put on everything I owned. Using my name, he tracked me down through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was overwhelmed with emotion and agreed to his fair price.

My parents had encouraged me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s when it was popular. I loved its calming sound, but I struggled to progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple tunes. It was also the era of punk music, where even those who couldn’t play well could be rock stars. When I received the guitar from Keith, I vividly remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt familiar yet smaller. I instinctively stood up, put a strap over my shoulder, and my fingers found the chords naturally. The electric guitar isn’t really a solo instrument, so now I’m learning it again, I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or perhaps there are others my age with similar stories. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" which is about people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Insomniacs, whom I interviewed in large numbers, will tell you that sleep is essential for our mental, physical, and social well-being. Those who struggle the most with sleep often understand its importance the best. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? They haven't been discussed much. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, the stage rich in dreams. Our most vivid and emotionally powerful dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers deprive people of REM, they experience more intense REM the next night to make up for it. This suggests dreams have a purpose. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that interpreting dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the study of dreams shifted to their physical origins. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School presented a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams better than others. He concluded that dream use increases with interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection to their dreams, as films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people benefiting from dreams? Don't teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? According to Stickgold, dreams help us combine ideas in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams might help us break free from usual thinking patterns. For example, Stickgold found that people woken from REM sleep give more original responses to words than those woken from other sleep stages. They make unexpected connections, which is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one barely remembered, seems to fuel creativity. On those days, words and images flow so quickly that my fingers can hardly keep up. I don't know how it works, but it does. Creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world and need our brains to function fully. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England. In her studio, which has a stunning sea view, you see empty frames on the walls alongside photos of her two daughters. Susie is a pioneer in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to replicate the richness of early-20th century impressionist works and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Surprisingly, she doesn't keep any of her own work. ""As soon as I finish them, they go,"" she says. Susie is in high demand. Over her 30-year career as a copyist, she has recreated works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that even art experts can mistake them for originals. While the originals could sell for millions, her copies range from a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie keeps her clients' identities mostly private, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but status plays a role too. One celebrity claims to own a 'Van Gogh' when it's actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh.' ""Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,"" she says. ""That's up to them."" Some collectors use her copies to save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank safe. Susie is transparent about her work. She aims to make her reproductions as authentic as possible, believing that doing otherwise would disrespect the original artist. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as an original is illegal, and although she knows people who have profited from it, she has never been tempted. Those who make fakes often face consequences. Susie isn't wealthy and has faced struggles, but her situation is more stable now, and risking her reputation isn't worth it. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After earning her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. It was a good foundation for her current work and sparked her love for plants, though it was hard to live on. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets but is glad to have found something more financially rewarding. When young artists seek her advice, she emphasizes the importance of learning to draw accurately and the extensive study required for her work. Her skills allow her to do anything from drawing plants to copying 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art. She now specializes in French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas as her favorites. Susie notes that people often think modern art is simple, almost like child's play. However, impressionists painted quickly yet meticulously, a challenging combination to master. Given her talent, it's surprising Susie doesn't create her own original art. Isn't art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She explains that her work is the result of years of training and dedication, and it provides a good living. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—decent, but not exceptional. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing career, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest on it. From a young age, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a unique connection with the boats that took her around the world, working in harmony with them. On land, everyday life seemed insignificant, and she quickly longed to return to the ocean, challenging herself against nature's forces, even in dangerous places. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It had been her home and survival space for 94 days. She explained the meticulous planning involved in her journey, down to the exact number of kitchen paper rolls she needed. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly displayed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and neatly organized medical supplies. Her boat was her world, and she cared for it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen views the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she participated in a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her reflect on humanity's tendency to exploit resources and move on. When I visited her office, she was finishing a passionate conference call about the urgent need to save the planet. She explained that coal, oil, and gas are finite resources, and we must find ways to conserve them. Initially, her message was about using less, but she realized the importance of reusing. She now advocates for sustainable practices, like reusable industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, Ellen has visited factories, mines, and power stations, discussing our dependence on non-renewable resources with governments and businesses. She admits she's not an expert but loves learning and absorbing information. The environmental crisis became something she couldn't ignore, making sailing seem selfish in comparison. She is focused on using her voice effectively to make a difference. Ellen also founded the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that encourages young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future through business and education.

Although she misses the adventure of being at sea, which is a core part of her identity, she finds her new mission more fulfilling. At sea, she was connected to everything around her, focused on records and survival. Her current message is more complex than simply being the fastest around the world, but she believes it surpasses anything she has done before."
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and aims to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become a very famous teenager. As many young people spend more time on computers and games, he hopes to inspire them to climb their own mountains or at least spend more time outdoors. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero,' and climbing Everest is just part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest to complete the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent. Few achieve this before turning thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these peaks and might complete them before his teenage years end.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agreed a young climber might be physically strong but doubted if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also questioned if a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions during such a climb. The Romeros are aware of these opinions. Paul says, 'I know there's criticism, but I can't focus on it – there's still so much to do. Karen and I consider the risks, but we trust our climbing experience. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He's becoming strong and mature.'

I also question Jordan's motivation. Is this just an ambitious father pushing his love of adventure too far? Paul insists, 'This isn't about me seeking fame through my son's achievements. Initially, Jordan thought about doing this later, but we decided: why not now? We regularly check with him to ensure he remains motivated.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

In the past, few cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting challenge. The more daring the record, the more interest it attracts. This presents a challenge for Jordan. While we might say that achievement often overshadows enjoyment, if Jordan wants to inspire others, he must engage with the media. This involves blogging, photo shoots, and interviews. He needs to offer something extraordinary, like climbing Everest. 'And you know what?' Paul says. 'If Jordan decides tomorrow that he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we'll end this project and head to the gym.'"
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they're not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but my classmates don't know much more about classical music than others our age. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't own their recordings. The statistics are discouraging for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells just 300 copies. I find that surprising. So, why has interest in this centuries-old music declined? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who attend classical concerts, but they're a minority. Although I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big classical music fan. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm, with many mood changes, are challenging for us. We like to talk, play, and think fast. Experts say we struggle to focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more appealing than long classical pieces without lyrics. Classical music is powerful but doesn't address teenage concerns. How we listen to music has changed. In the past, families made music together at home, and playing an instrument was valued. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but our lives rarely feature classical music. When did you last hear classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says classical concert audiences have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in various places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why people prefer classical concerts in middle age, but if your parents love something, you're likely to avoid it as a teenager. Some blame schools for teenagers' lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are eager to play in school orchestras. They arrive early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. Classical music interests them when performing, but it's not their first choice for listening. The two activities have become separate. When we relax, it's always pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you regret my presence here,"" she said to the school, with a hint of amusement. Her mother, who was getting out from the other side, didn’t hear her, but Bonnie wouldn’t have minded if she had. Her mother was aware of her feelings. Mrs. Wyndham surveyed the surroundings. Almonside was an unusual school, with various buildings hidden among the trees on a wooded hillside; it seemed confusing at first glance. Then she noticed the signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie remarked, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother replied. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved through the trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of trailing behind like a dog,"" Mrs. Wyndham said tiredly, though she didn’t seem to expect Bonnie to comply. A few minutes later, her mother was speaking with Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be expelled soon enough,"" she mused to the door, ""so why not speed things up?"" She left the building and headed towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was a charming old building for the horses and a large indoor riding arena. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with a certain respect. Bonnie always treated horses with care. She could immediately tell that the horses were well cared for. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, examining each horse carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, running a finger along its nose. The next horse caught her attention. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she exclaimed. He was brown with a touch of white. Probably lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick, according to the sign above the stall. Suddenly, she couldn’t resist the urge to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They must be nearby."" The room with all the riding equipment was, to Bonnie’s delight, unlocked. Absorbed in the enjoyable task of saddling Maverick, she forgot all about her mother and the headmaster. Once she was seated high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, ruler of all she surveyed. Her nickname at her previous school had been Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said admiringly, ""and I’m not exaggerating, because I know horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think you and I could become great friends,"" she confided. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exhilarating, a breeze brushing her cheek and making it glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he’d jump well."
43,"I've met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. The 15-year-old Australian has already released several successful songs. So how did a laid-back surfer end up on stage in front of thousands of fans? ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six years old and started writing songs when I was seven,"" Cody says, recalling how it all began. ""But I was swimming every day and surfing. Those were the things that meant more to me back then; I had my life set up and so much to occupy my time. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online."" These videos changed everything. He began with a video of a friend and himself singing at a school concert. Fans sent online comments saying they wanted more of his videos on their social networking sites. So Cody, who had recorded some more at home, was happy to oblige. The responses were overwhelming. Cody was a very talented swimmer. He was training hard with some of the best coaches and focusing on perfecting his sport. But then record labels came calling, and he had a tough choice to make: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a huge risk by signing a deal and moving with his entire family to the US. Cody decided to take the plunge. ""It was very difficult for me—especially at such a young age—to have to choose a career for myself. Can you imagine, at 12 or 13 years old, trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and his friends that he was moving to the States. ""It came as a big surprise to most people. I'm kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked expressions. ""I'm very modest, and I think it's important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and went with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream in the hope of making another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn't directly involved in his career, they are there in the background. Cody says it's important to keep a tight circle of great people around you to make sure your feet stay on the ground. Of course, we all have days of doubt. ""Sometimes when I'm left alone for a while, I sit and think, 'How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?' My little brother's eight years old, and he's traveling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn't have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about the effect of that on him sometimes, but my family's always reassuring me that they're here to support me and encourage me in everything that I do."" Success, in whatever career you choose, comes from a willingness to say ""yes"" to your big break, even when it's a little scary to do so. ""It all just happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be going to countries I never thought I'd visit in my life, and to be playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans—it's like something that I think lots of people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won't last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, pulled back the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbag wall, which was there to protect the buildings from flooding as the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting those sandbags into place. Last week, I worked long hours with most of the town's adults, showing I could handle it. But my grandfather didn't seem to notice. With one hand on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the wood factory in Milltown. Fragile ice was on either side, with solid ice downstream. As I changed into my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. I didn't recognize him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. It's better than having a famous grandfather because only he, my mom, and I know about it. Plus, I have his diary from that journey, which I read before bed. I patted the chain and headed to the kitchen. ""Morning, Rex,"" Mom said as I took a banana from the counter. ""You're up early for a Saturday. I'll make brunch after your training. Be careful."" ""Thanks, Mom."" I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa. ""Watch where you're going,"" he shouted. ""Where are you going?"" ""Sorry, Grandpa. I'm going kayaking."" As if my wetsuit didn't make that clear. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore his temper, but it's getting harder. ""Why train? You didn't win the competition,"" he said. His words stung, but I took a deep breath and counted to three. He slammed the bathroom door. Mom gave me a sympathetic smile. ""Don't mind him. He's..."" ""...not himself,"" I finished. I didn't say he's always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient. As a child, he was my hero, showing me his National Geographic photos. Those photos still hang in his room, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don't go in there anymore. I have my own trophies now and hope to be in National Geographic someday. Yet, part of me still wants to admire him, despite his temper. Mom smiled. ""At least he's coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your dedication, even in the cold!"" I smiled back, peeling my banana. ""It'll be warmer in South America,"" I said. ""If I find sponsors for my expedition."" She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. In the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly Grandpa's work, but different from anything he had done before, and it was obviously unfinished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. A river dominated the scene; it wasn't a river she recognized and might not even be real, just a fantasy. The picture was strange and shapeless, yet beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely noticeable, just a hint of green, drawing the eye into the pale waters and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, too detached, revealing her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his paintings. He just painted them and let others interpret them, if they could. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed to have a strange importance to her, though she couldn't say why. And there was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. Still, he hasn't finished it yet, so maybe he's going to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't resist. It's such an unusual picture, especially having a name. I suppose you can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to waste time telling every idiot..."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""...every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone who came along, they'd never get any work done. And he said..."" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually just to say the muse wasn't being kind to him that day, or that he'd have to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on, or something like that. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today I will cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm quite unlucky that way. 

What I was actually doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute—small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it: shepherdesses, milkmaids, and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet, so I was thrilled when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it has to stand in a corner. 

I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems I'll be in my broom cupboard for years. I don't really mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only take a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... 

Then it came to me. If I couldn't cut anything off Gran's cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly 'borrow' things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it would be challenging to meet fans' expectations. Fans of the book have clear ideas about how everything should look. I relied a lot on the original drawings from the book because I didn't want people to criticize me for getting it wrong. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming more complex. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' perspective. They wore out many pairs of jeans doing this! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We developed a unique technique for this. After the series aired, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I especially remember the coins—they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there's a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses, and they said it was so frightening they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls' clothes. This made it nearly impossible for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and had to be sewn into the dress every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was shot with actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look—I did 2,000 by the end. They weren’t accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast—I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully conveyed the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren't there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the ""can-you-get-me-free-tickets-to-your-dad’s-concerts?"" requests. ""Everything’s going to be fine,"" I reassure her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out. Then she drives off, leaving me to face this new school and situation. But this is what I wanted—to leave my old life on the road and with tour tutors. While the band is renting here for recording, we’re staying permanently. I insisted on attending this school to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal. I enter the school’s main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I say to the secretary. ""Name?"" She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad uses his stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it’s printing,"" she says, then hands me the sheet. English Literature, first period. Great, I can handle that. English is my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map last night to avoid looking lost. When I reach the door, the teacher is already taking roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles, looking at my outfit—jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! No one will suspect me now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I glance at my expensive platforms with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. Dead giveaway. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says hesitantly. ""Here."" She smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After reviewing them and discussing the books we’ll read, she lets us socialize! All teachers should do this. ""So why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have options. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Essence? I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose South Beach Sounds, a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out eventually. But I’ll pretend to be normal until then. ""He’s an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way."" And she doesn’t seem to care. Perfect."
49,"Text: 'The average American teenage girl today is expected to be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is the reality for American teenagers now. They can't just go to school and stay unnoticed, because being average is no longer enough. Mediocrity is not acceptable, and lacking ambition is seen as laziness. ""People, often adults, forget how much pressure teenagers face these days. We have lots of homework, tests, extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to maintain a social life,"" says teenager Kristen Loose. Despite these pressures being normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes about them still exist, often spread by the media. You know the stereotypes: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. While there is some truth to these, it's not fair to label the entire generation this way. ""Many people assume we spend most of our time watching TV and using our cell phones,"" Loose says. She believes this is mostly wrong. She admits to keeping her cellphone nearby, but not just for fun. It's not just for texting friends; it's a tool that teens use to make their lives easier. Students today are expected to have immediate access to the world and be reachable at all times, which can seem like a cell phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can now do their work anywhere, even on the go. Instead of listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate; they require 24-hour attention from already busy teens. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. Their schedule is full of school, after-school activities, family duties, and homework. Then, they have to get up and do it all again the next day, often with less than the recommended nine hours of sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teens get the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. Moreover, 28 percent of teens admitted falling asleep in school about once a week due to lack of sleep. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says that after all her activities, she gets about 18 hours of free time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is not much. Olsen rarely spends this time on social media or TV. Instead, she focuses on volunteer work. ""I think the stereotype of teenagers is that they only care about themselves and their immediate interests,"" Olsen says. Despite this image, Olsen's favorite part of the week is volunteering. ""I love serving others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community."" In 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but they will still be proving it wrong and pushing the world forward. There will be another generation of students taking the world by storm, all before they finish school.'"
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth's surface. Their project is both a science experiment and an adventure, which attracts teenagers. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or metal piece enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As night fell, the teenagers attached a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside was a camera, an altitude instrument, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were outside the lunch box to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a neighboring state, inflated the balloon to the size of a small car. An older boy had made a seven-hour trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For these kids, such efforts are normal. Finally, it was time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chanted, and the balloon began its ascent. Some ran and tracked its path with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There was a quiet sense of wonder. Then the balloon vanished into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, under a clear sky, just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I saw a boy climb into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ said one girl softly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor streaked across the sky. As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased, and the balloon expanded until it was almost the size of a house. Then it burst. A parachute helped the lunch box land safely. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Recovering it wasn’t easy, but that was part of the fun. The area around Bishop is mostly uninhabited, so the lunch box usually lands in remote places. ‘Recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, noting they’ve lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘We’ve become more familiar with this landscape in ways we wouldn’t normally.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To reach it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘These students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to them.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It was disappointing, but it was a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. And it was another adventure story to share."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. Her interest began by chance when she helped her younger brother with a science project. She found an article about recent discoveries in Palaeontology, which fascinated her. Chloe decided then that she wanted to pursue this field. 

I asked her about the support she received, as Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people at that time. She recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous despite being young. Chloe was nervous about meeting him, fearing he might find her questions annoying. However, she felt comfortable when he showed patience and was willing to listen.

We discussed how palaeontologists are portrayed in movies and TV shows. Chloe acknowledges that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She finds the portrayal of palaeontologists in films misleading, often depicting them as eccentric geniuses or geeky figures. She feels that films do not accurately represent their daily work.

Chloe explains that her job is varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in laboratories, analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. Although not a daily task, she also communicates scientific findings to the public. Chloe believes it's important to address misunderstandings about science and enjoys reaching out to young people to inspire them about the natural world.

Chloe was involved in the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, where she advised on the accuracy of dinosaur portrayals. She praises the program's creators for their knowledge and says her role was mainly to ensure the dinosaurs shown coexisted in the same time period. The documentary attracted audiences of all ages because it depicted dinosaurs more accurately than films like Jurassic Park.

I asked Chloe why dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain a focus of research. She believes they appeal to our innate curiosity and the desire for discovery. Dinosaurs remind us that there is still much to explore, and Palaeontology offers a form of time travel."
52,"Text: ""Let me say this clearly: when you're on a car trip with your family, even at six years old, you probably know you're not 'there yet,' even if you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' Once you arrive, it's not 'there' anymore; it's 'here.' So, if you think you might be 'there,' you should ask 'Are we here yet?' No one wants to be 'there' more than the parents who hear that question repeatedly on long trips. Really, what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn't you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing expected of you? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles, while the scenery passes by outside. In the front seat, mum or dad is there to hand out snacks, change the radio, and keep everything running smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone does something annoying—like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it's his other foot, then a hand, and soon he's in my space, and a fight starts. The driver and co-pilot separate us as the car swerves. They tell Tim to stay in his seat and keep his hands to himself. Peace returns for a while. The scenery continues to pass by. Then, as I'm trying to read, I feel a draught on my arm. The window isn't open, so where's it from? Tim is next to me, quietly blowing air on me. He's on his side, not touching me, so he's technically not doing anything wrong. Just breathing? What's the problem? The anger rises. Tim gets scolded, the car swerves again. Then calm returns—for now. Over the years, Dad has developed ways to handle us in the back seat. For example, when we ask 'Are we there yet?' he often says, 'Yes. Get out of the car.' 'But Dad, we're still on the highway.' 'Oh, maybe we're not there yet.' That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you're finally 'there' when the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids who have annoyed them for hours. So remember: if mum and dad are close enough to answer your question, then no, you're not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where visitors can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and return. Zuzi explains their motivation: ""With so much technology, everyone is busy on their phones. We wanted to bring people together without screens. It's natural for us to communicate face-to-face.""

The games at their café are called 'Eurogames', known for gentle themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged. This idea evolved into 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging social interaction. Pandemic, a Eurogame by North American designer Matt Leacock, requires players to solve global problems together. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame based on Lord of the Rings. He recalls, ""Playing it with friends was thrilling. Everyone felt good, win or lose. I wanted to create something similar.""

Leacock's love for board games began in childhood. He often felt disappointed with games, so he and his uncle would redesign them. Pandemic became a huge success, and its sequel added storytelling elements, similar to video games, where characters develop and the world changes.

Interestingly, the video game industry's growth has helped board games succeed. Video games have made gaming more common, and many people now play games on their smartphones. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, notes, ""Everyone's a mobile gamer now. More people are open to playing games.""

Initially, video games offered social interaction in arcades or through multiplayer games at home. But as multiplayer gaming moved online, players became physically distant. Some people who enjoyed video games started seeking in-person gaming experiences again. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, these games offer a way to connect in person, and this trend is likely to grow."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are crucial in the music industry, even if your career starts with setbacks. Jamie's mother, an excellent singer, introduced him to the guitar. Growing up, he only listened to a local radio station for middle-aged people, which influenced his musical tastes. He didn't hear a contemporary song until he was 12. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room, playing the piano. Although he was good at tennis, he realized it wasn't his passion. At 17, he left school to pursue a music career. He formed a duo with a friend who was a decent guitarist but not as committed to a music career. Jamie told his parents about his dream, explaining that he wrote lyrics during economics lessons and played the piano while others played outside. His father gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he signed with a music publisher at 19, thanks to one song. However, record labels wanted him as a solo artist, so he parted ways with his friend. Ultimately, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a challenging time with a UK record label, he switched to another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune didn't follow. Jamie feels that as an artist, he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, he was in the right place. Writing for others became his strength. He believes he is one of the main writers UK labels rely on to help launch new artists' careers. Sometimes, he explains to artists that aiming for chart success is nothing to be ashamed of. He asks them, ""Don't you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?"" He emphasizes creating songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well. In a world of false modesty in pop music, Jamie speaks openly about wanting to write number-one hits. He isn't arrogant; he simply knows he has a talent for it. Instead of worrying about others' opinions, he focuses on his goal. ""That's the endgame when I go into the studio,"" he says. ""We aim to write the best music of next year, not just what's cool. We want to create classic modern pop songs."""
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity: a big star online, but probably unknown to those who don't watch online videos of bike stunts. He is a 'street trials cyclist', performing jumps from places like roofs or walls to other unusual spots. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I meet him for an interview at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, the local boys recognize him immediately. Even older people come by to praise him, calling him 'an absolute legend'. After seeing his skills, I agree with them. Initially skeptical, I am impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains his plan, and I often doubt he can succeed. Yet, when I praise him, he seems indifferent and somewhat downcast. Despite his online fame, Tony admits he is a reluctant celebrity. He finds the social aspect challenging and prefers doing things over discussing them. This is ironic since his fame comes from social media and the camera technology that fuels it. He acknowledges that this technology allows people like him to earn a living. However, he feels uneasy about everyone constantly filming themselves or staring at screens. Still, he doesn't complain, as the videos provide him a good income from what would have been just a hobby in the past. From years of interviewing top athletes, I've learned that two key factors turn an enthusiastic child into an elite competitor: energy and the ability to overcome emotional setbacks. These qualities may be more important than talent and help athletes persist despite failures. In riskier sports, mental strength is crucial. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on relatively easy but unfamiliar obstacles. He simply got up and tried again until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some think he is reckless and takes unnecessary risks. He responds that these critics are not well-informed and likely have never ridden a trials bike. They don't understand the technical aspects of his sport or that he consults experts to minimize risks. Tony is careful about the risks he takes. He believes it's wise to be aware of dangers. People who never feel scared probably shouldn't do these sports. He divides people into those who can't overcome fear and those who can. He belongs to the latter group, feeling fear but finding a way past it. He is not addicted to risk and spends hours planning and preparing. Sometimes he rides around to get in the right mindset before attempting a new stunt. He knows he mustn't lose his nerve before a jump. If he fully commits, he is fine."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on several dangerous challenges for charity, such as running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. Her latest challenge involved walking on a high wire, a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and avoid falling, she carried a long stick weighing eight kilograms. Helen trained with an expert high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she quickly learned that high-wire walking was very different. ""The training was a shock,"" said Helen. ""I didn’t realize how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen calmed herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she admitted afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old-style bicycle with one large and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He was passionate about motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it for a holiday trip to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two unsuccessful attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop due to a knee injury, he finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries across four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which led to a serious fever. He was bedridden in a hostel for ten days without medicine. He had no money for hospital bills or to return home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that lets us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have plenty of information about their daytime activities, but nothing about what they do at night, as we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about protecting their habitat based on our findings. The work is challenging. There are four of us, each working six hours a day. We have studied ducks in various locations, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and record every duck I see. The weather has been difficult – some nights are mild, but more often it's wet. It's so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We've only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a lab, where we will analyze our results together. It will be tough to be indoors, but it's necessary. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is crucial to ensure that customers receive perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from my company. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, and spend time selecting the best ones for our chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I test and taste products I create, and I share samples with my colleagues. My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to retreat to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm at our food lab, and other times I'm traveling abroad to buy raw materials. This can be challenging because I have a young family. However, I love the variety and lack of routine, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! People often ask if I get tired of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more in the evening!'"
60,"Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things such as balls or even fire, and trapeze, which involves flying through the air above an amazed audience. During the year-long course, students gradually take more risks in each class, and parents can attend some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, ""For a circus career, performers need to avoid repeating the same acts – it's important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to succeed in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great aspect is the friendship with other performers and the opportunity to learn from them. Being fit is also crucial – circus artists, like athletes, train daily to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or only work a few months each year. But the real challenge is planning for the future because you can only perform while you're young, and then you need to consider other options."" The course also includes business planning. Many former students have started businesses worldwide and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, that it's not a profession for making money! ""The work usually means not having a regular salary. It's also competitive – but great fun!"""
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you've likely heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer, someone who supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't talented enough to be lead singers. That's not true—they often need to be even more skilled. People like Mariam are the true stars of the music industry! ""What I love about my job is that when I enter the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a quirky little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by producers' requests. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just get on with the job!""

""Excellent musical abilities are essential for my work, along with the ability to learn quickly. There's often no sheet music to refer to. I'll never forget my first experience recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, along with an orchestra. I was terrified: I knew that if I made a mistake, it would mean recording everything again, which nobody enjoys. Recording sessions are long enough as they are.""

""One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always understand which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it."""
62,"Text: Julie Deane started with only basic fashion knowledge and created a successful business with her 'satchels'—traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in world-famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before choosing satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning, instead of going with her first thought. Once she decided, not everyone agreed with her choice. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She involved her family from the start, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural business ability. The design inspiration came from children's storybooks. Although Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they have been crucial to her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would mention them in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed of production. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for original styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a challenging time when another company copied Julie's design to sell similar products. As a result, she now ensures she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices—people love working there. There's now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky decided to try many sports. She was a talented swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling daily and performing well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all – and when the excitement fades, there’s no point. Fortunately, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, bringing young people together as part of a larger group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people doubt whether celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it for self-promotion, which can overshadow the charity’s real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Her parents weren't musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother. Ana first sang in front of an audience at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to gain confidence. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional. Although she was the youngest, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher ignored her ideas, so she wrote Something to Say about her frustration. She posted the song online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled across Ireland to invite her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn't know the company and didn't want to be told what to sing. Joss assured her this wouldn't happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was an amazing night. Ana prefers writing songs about difficult times because she feels there's more to express. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it affected him. While she hopes fans enjoy her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that matter to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an incredible trip—a guided group tour by boat along Canada's west coast. It was my brother Harry's idea. Like me, he's a journalist, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He's a big fan of boats, which is not something we have in common. However, I had always dreamed of visiting the area since seeing it on TV as a child, especially because our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally agreed! A few days before our departure, there were storms in the area we planned to visit. Fortunately, the weather forecast for our trip promised calm seas. Although there was a lot to organize, I was busy with work and didn't have much time to think about it. But Harry assured me he had taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying. After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people lived along that coast, and indeed, the only other living creatures we saw that first morning were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn't recognize. It was wonderful to stop worrying about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all prepared together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it truly felt like stress-free living! When it was time to leave, I felt sad. How could I return to normal life? But I knew if I stayed, I would miss family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. As a child, I often went to watch his games. You might think that seeing so many matches would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually brought a book to read instead of watching the games. When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. My sports teacher noticed my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session but felt I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, my teacher believed in me more than I did. It took some time, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. Having my parents watch made me nervous, but it turned out fine! For the next four years, I practiced daily and did well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA at fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't enjoy being far from my parents at first. At home, I couldn't spend much time with friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly! I turned professional at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most professional players since I was fifteen but was too light for my height, so I had to work on that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After considering several options, I trained to become a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This involved taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see the city I’d lived in my whole life through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. Although I thought it would be simple, I found out that to get a licence, I needed to know much more than I had learned. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, covering everything from local architecture and history to public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I gained my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding isn’t just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group in crowds. Many other skills are necessary. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and you need to react to changing situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive or a route changes. Tourists don’t want to hear about problems; they just want to enjoy a well-organised tour. I need to ensure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know these reviews are important because good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy mean my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I traveled to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Although she is five years younger than me, we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. Initially, I was unsure if we would connect with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous since it was our first experience doing something like this. However, there was no need to worry in the end.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants consume large amounts of grass and banana plants, so collecting this took most of the day. Josie found it challenging, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meals made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found this very enjoyable, even though I ended up wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so space was limited. That was our choice, as Josie preferred not to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and vegetarian, which suited us since we are not fond of meat. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie rarely talks about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I am not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not fully enjoying her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she reflects on it, she realizes how fortunate she was to have the experience. Maybe she will return one day—I certainly plan to!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I own a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people for their friends or homes; we have a variety of customers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of it. My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often colder and darker than I'd like, but that's normal for that time of the morning, so I don't mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make choosing difficult. If I were choosing for myself, I'd probably only pick pink ones because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what customers want aren't always the same. Not all flowers are available year-round, so sometimes I can't find what customers want. I don't enjoy negotiating prices with the flower sellers, but it's necessary. Flowers aren't cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we check customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we create bouquets and calculate the cost of orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy figuring out how to make the nicest arrangements for the money they want to spend. That's part of selling things, and I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films, including many for kids on weekends. It's close to where I live, but a year ago, I felt something was missing—the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema for our screenings. Instead, we pick a different location in the city each month. For instance, we rented an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which created the perfect atmosphere for the film—it was amazing! Some venues are even free because the owners earn money by selling snacks during the film, allowing us to keep our prices low. We’re happy just to cover our costs—we’re not aiming for profit. Each screening gets easier, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also track ticket sales online, so we no longer worry about empty seats! There’s always plenty to do, but when people of all ages tell us they had a great experience, it’s wonderful. Our website has been a great help, and we’re now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We’ve visited them to see how they operate, but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because most people now look online for film information rather than reading local paper reviews. We’ve also tried putting up posters in cafés. However, nothing beats word of mouth—people recommending us to their friends. The audience loves the special activities we organize with each film—last month, we had a movie quiz that everyone enjoyed."
71,"Text: 'As a child, taking photographs was my favorite activity. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I decided to start a personal project: taking one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I began. After a few weeks, I uploaded these photos to a website for young photographers to create a photo diary and share my work. I was surprised to find that others liked my perspective and photography. I enjoyed capturing a variety of subjects. Someone suggested that having a common theme would improve my project, and I agreed. I started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, unlike other young photographers who used color. I sometimes doubted my project and almost quit several times. However, I trusted my instincts and grew more confident in my style. I showed my project to my art teacher, who told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some photos for fun. I'll never forget when the judges announced I had won first prize; I was thrilled because my project was important to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough for a professional career. Now, I have my own photography studio and have never regretted my career choice.'"
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because they offered activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking, which I had never tried before. In the NYC, you can participate in various activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you complete each level, you receive a certificate. When I first joined, my leader suggested that my initial challenge should be helping to organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was unsure about this idea because I had joined that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was quite shy, and the other children already had their own groups, so I stopped going after a few weeks. However, I decided to take on the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just earning the certificate. After completing the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club because I had developed strong relationships with the children. Now, I volunteer there for about four hours a week and always look forward to it. Because of my experience at the children’s club, I have decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker, someone who works with children. This was not something I had considered before joining the club. In fact, I had never thought about my future career, and youth work had never crossed my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my communication skills while helping others. I have earned several other NYC certificates now, including one for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to enjoy it too. He made it look easy, and eventually, I managed well. After that, I quickly developed a love for the sport and improved my skills. I started competing at ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored, but my love for competing and winning has grown stronger as I've gotten older, which motivates me to push myself. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes it works out well, like when I became the first female to score a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn't sure I'd try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities. In the summer, I focus on training and studying since there's no snow. I train daily, but it's nice not to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with friends, which helps me cope with not being able to snowboard. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I feel it's important to have another option in case I don't succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I'm considering becoming a doctor if my active life allows time for college. It's hard to imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I can't do it my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had and never thought about the future. For instance, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I am grateful to my parents for this because it taught me an important lesson. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I was surprised at how easy it was, even though it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it was boring, but I was excited about it. Mum showed me how to create something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewellery to friends and family, who said they loved them. I thought they were just being nice, so I wasn't sure if they were good enough for the public. To find out, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists visit my town, and they bought my jewellery as gifts. Soon, we got calls from all over the country from people wanting to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just the two of us at a market stall! That's when I realized it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. The book is partly inspired by Janine’s own life. In an interview, Janine explained, ""Because of my father’s job, my family moved around a lot, so I got good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, starting at a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination for that."" Janine began writing her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always dreamed of being a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she had won first prize in a short story competition on a young writers’ website. Because of this, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publisher, they were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was available in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia notes that, despite the cover showing happy teenagers, the characters face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer says that even though Janine is young and the novel isn’t very long, she has shown she is a better writer than many bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. I’d like to give advice to other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, spending time with friends gives me ideas to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. This happened because my father was invited to manage the castle. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was excited about the opportunity, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree he should take the job. We were concerned about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home across the water, and there was no school on the island. However, once we moved, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle isn't particularly beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. In summer, the island feels lively because it attracts many visitors, and there are often beach parties. In winter, we only see the other families living on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers as I had hoped. The adults support each other and help with repairs, which often involves hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day to my old school. I was excited about stormy days with big waves, but the ferries don't run then! I've learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates visit, I always tell them to hurry up! But we often get fantastic views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it's so foggy you can't see anything, then suddenly it's sunny again – it's still amazing even after living here for a while. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid damage. But then I remind myself it's been here for centuries – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I’ve always loved nature and wild animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m close to achieving that because on family holidays abroad, I’ve seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I’d see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, though, as I’ve learned that patience is important in this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers found it fascinating and commented on it. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before I was introduced and walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they’d really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I began playing football at the age of 7. I would hurry home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and soon I became a decent player. However, my family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. In fact, I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one referee noticed my potential. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. She was impressed and invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But I started regular training with a big club at just 13 years old. After that, I improved a lot. Despite this, some people doubted I’d become a star player, which upset me a bit. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to believe they could play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be the same as my coach’s advice to me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in higher education in the UK and worldwide is encouraging students to engage in research early in their studies. This shift acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars or scientists at top universities. Instead, it is a fundamental way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only in academics but also in the workplace, as they help us think critically about the world and our work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? Why does it matter? These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can range from groundbreaking, complex studies by highly trained experts to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about issues and practices. Most students have been researchers in some way, asking questions and investigating since their early days in school or work. You have developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, choosing a music system, or shopping online.

In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, identifying problems, critically evaluating information, and constructing your own responses are expected learning activities. Some students may find this challenging, especially if they come from cultures where knowledge is seen as established and learned by listening to authority figures like teachers and texts. In the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This approach might seem daunting, but critical thinking is crucial in research. We must engage with others' research, test it, and determine if it is logical and backed by evidence, rather than accepting it uncritically."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, London coffee houses were places where people discussed topics like chemistry and politics. In modern Paris, cafés on the Left Bank were where artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities can be creative hubs, they are also unnatural and overwhelming. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. Although city life is known to be tiring, new research shows that it can also dull our thinking. One major factor is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for the brain. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they offer a mental break from city life. This research is timely, as more people now live in cities than ever before. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded urban areas, surrounded by strangers. These unnatural environments impact our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy city street requires the brain to manage many tasks: avoiding distracted pedestrians, crossing streets safely, and navigating the complex layout. These tasks drain our mental energy because they force us to constantly focus and redirect our attention. The brain is like a powerful computer, but paying attention uses a lot of its resources. In contrast, natural settings don't demand as much cognitive effort. This concept is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Natural environments capture our attention without causing negative emotions, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our mental focus to relax and recharge. Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and sought ways to incorporate nature into urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer an escape from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While people try various methods to boost cognitive performance, such as energy drinks or office redesigns, few are as effective as a walk in nature. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain sources of intellectual life. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same urban features that challenge our attention also drive innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities fuels creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a hub of intellectual breakthroughs, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, thrive as centers of technology. Less crowded cities may produce less innovation over time. The challenge is to reduce the psychological harm of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people feel, ""I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city!"""
81,"Text: 'Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious: thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain imaging to support this. However, I believe the study of the mind shouldn't stop at the skin or skull. Evidence from prehistory to now shows that objects, not just neurons, are part of human thinking. Archaeology reveals that stone tools, ornaments, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have influenced human evolution and the mind. So, what is outside the head might still be part of the mind. The mind and brain are often seen as the same because studies usually isolate people from their surroundings to focus on the brain. This is practical for neuroscientists using brain scans, but it overlooks how much thinking happens outside our heads. I don't deny the brain's role in cognition, but I suggest that human intelligence extends into culture and the material world. This idea is central to my Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET explores how objects become part of our thinking, like using clay for numbers or stones for tools. It also looks at how these interactions have evolved and what they mean for our thinking. This approach changes our understanding of the mind by considering what objects do for it. Consider a blind person with a stick. Where does their self begin? The stick and the person form a unit, showing how minds and objects are connected. The stick helps the blind person 'see' through touch, becoming part of their body. This example highlights the adaptability of human intelligence, which changes with new technologies. I see the human mind as always evolving. Throughout history, from stone tools to the internet, objects have been pathways for understanding the world, not barriers. Humans use 'sticks' to explore and learn, unlike monkeys who use them just for food. This unique human trait explains why we create things and how these things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds change as they interact with the material world. MET offers a new perspective on how material culture, from ancient tools to smartphones, shapes and transforms our thinking. While 'mind-changing technology' sounds futuristic, humans have used it since our beginnings.'"
82,"Few inventions have changed civilization as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of the culture at every level—from practical and scientific uses to industrial and aesthetic ones, and even entertainment. Historians argue that photography is perhaps the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. In no other art form has US work been so influential. This suggests that photography is central to US intellectual and aesthetic discussions, and to fully appreciate its impact, we must look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so appealing? Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology in a country that embraced change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with stunning immediacy. Secondly, the camera was the preferred tool for representing oneself, allowing people to present an image for public view in a country where personal and national identities were always evolving. Thirdly, the camera was important for creating and preserving family memories, even if they were somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs matched the US artists' tendency towards realism and depicting everyday life.

A photograph draws attention to something, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because it is made by a machine, a photograph is a record of events, people, or things, and it has a certain objectivity. However, since it is taken by an individual, it also carries a personal perspective, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, leading to the idea of photography as a 'universal language.' But photographic meaning is more complex. No image is presented without some context that influences our understanding, such as a newspaper caption or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and function in its cultural context: Why did the photographer take it? How was it first seen? The same image might be viewed in different places and times, changing its meaning each time.

The camera's importance to artists was once a secret, but now it is widely recognized. For several decades, starting with US artist Andy Warhol's use of photographs in paintings and silk screens, artists have been incorporating photographs into their work in various ways. In short, photographic vision has become an essential part of art history, not opposing painting but complementing it, and is integral to our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some understanding of what this means. However, even though we can study this concept in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains somewhat elusive. James, like most psychologists, was particularly interested in human psychology. He believed it consisted of basic elements: thoughts and feelings, a physical world in time and space, and a way of knowing about these things. This knowledge is mainly personal and private, coming from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It may or may not be influenced by scientific facts. Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological matters based on our own experiences. We act as amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex psychological issues, like whether brainwashing works, or when we state our opinions as facts about why people behave in certain ways, such as feeling insulted or unhappy, or suddenly quitting their jobs. Problems arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to provide methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in a given situation or to determine when each applies. Psychologists help us distinguish between subjective thoughts, which may be biased, and facts: between our preconceptions and what is scientifically ""true."" Psychology, as defined by James, is about the mind or brain. Although psychologists study the brain, they do not fully understand its workings to explain its role in our hopes, fears, and wishes, or in our behavior during different experiences like giving birth or watching a football match. It is rarely possible to study the brain directly. So, psychologists learn more by studying behavior and using observations to form hypotheses about what is happening inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not observable like an engine's. In everyday life, they can only be perceived indirectly and inferred from behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, involving evaluating and interpreting clues. These clues must come from careful observation, accurate measurement, scientific analysis, and logical interpretation that can be publicly scrutinized. Complex interactions are common in psychology, and understanding them requires sophisticated techniques and theories. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or modify the processes it studies. Once these goals are achieved, it can help us understand our experiences and apply conclusions to people's lives. Psychological findings have been useful in areas like teaching children to read, designing safer machine control panels, and helping emotionally distressed people communicate their feelings better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been scientifically investigated in the past 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection—reflecting on one's own conscious experience—to answer psychological questions. These early studies aimed to identify mental structures, which is still of interest today. However, introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it leaves one a helpless spectator of only a small part of automatic brain work. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of phenomena, like others' behavior, rather than on personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays products that were removed from sale because they were unpopular, like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. Carol Sherry, who manages the museum, believes each product tells a sad story of failure for its creators. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business, attracting executives who rarely keep their own failed products. The museum began by accident when Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, started collecting new products in the 1960s. He wanted a 'reference library' of consumer products, not just failures. However, he discovered that most products fail, so his collection naturally included many unsuccessful items.

Today's culture of optimism might explain why these failed products exist. Many products likely passed through meetings where no one realized they were doomed. Even if they did, marketers might have invested more money to force some sales and save face. Little effort is made to understand what went wrong, and people involved often avoid discussing failures. This focus on optimism is common in the growing 'self-help' industry, where 'positive visualization' is popular. The idea is that imagining success makes it more likely, but neuroscientist Tali Sharot suggests our brains are wired to be overly optimistic. Her research shows that well-balanced people often overestimate their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen has studied the effects of 'positive fantasies about the future.' Her findings reveal that thinking too much about success can reduce motivation. For example, people encouraged to imagine a successful week at work often achieve less. Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our response to failure depends on our beliefs about ability. People with a 'fixed theory' mindset think ability is innate, so failure is terrifying. In contrast, those with an 'incremental theory' believe ability grows through effort and see failure as a chance to improve. Dweck compares this to weight-training: muscles grow by being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, regardless of success."
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have a big advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many of us think we know; it seems obvious. However, professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors challenge the traditional idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what makes players perform at their best, leading to many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, financial interests question if home advantage should matter at all. If players are paid well, shouldn't they perform well anywhere? 

What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their passion and support. Fans often think that their cheering leads to goals, but they forget the times when their noise didn't lead to success. 

However, one fan belief is supported by science. Home fans often try to influence the referee. In a famous experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This matched the actual decisions made during the game. Researchers concluded that referees avoid extra stress by not making calls against the home team. 

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England's Football League won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in luxury. Stadiums are also more similar now. Despite these changes, home advantage still varies by sport. 

Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. One reason might be that home advantage is more about team spirit, which is less important in baseball. Team sports require coordination, and playing at home boosts confidence. 

Another possibility is related to a primitive urge to defend home territory. Studies show players' testosterone levels are higher before home games. This was seen in the Rugby World Cup, where underdogs won at home using determination and aggression. As one referee said, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’"""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous in sports and valued by athletes and coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with claims for other golfers of that time. Its meaning is also intriguing. Player didn't mean luck literally; he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ But how much better can one get through practice alone? This question is central to the nature-nurture debate in sports: is talent innate or developed? The discussion has been one-sided, favoring nurture. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent in any field is linked to psychologist Anders Ericsson. He proposed that 10,000 hours of practice can make anyone an expert. This theory inspired books like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers"" and others, all suggesting practice is key. They argue that 10,000 hours is necessary and sufficient for expertise. However, in his book, Epstein challenges this view with many case studies. He points out a flaw in research on excellence: it often only looks at successful people. Science is better at explaining why an elite athlete succeeds after the fact. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others don't, considering innate traits and factors like environment and determination. His research takes him worldwide, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to Alaska. There, he learns that in a tough sled dog race, the huskies' drive might be genetic, suggesting a link between genes and motivation. This challenges the idea that commitment is purely a choice. Epstein distinguishes between 'hardware' (nature) and 'software' (nurture) and believes both are essential for elite athletes. He acknowledges the role of training and environment, suggesting that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a basketball player instead of a sprinter. But Epstein also highlights cases where genetics are crucial. He examines race and gender issues, asking: ‘If only practice matters, why separate men and women in sports?’ Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most insightful."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are spending too much time indoors, stuck in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature. This, she argues, is the main issue. This idea aligns with other discussions about modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling days spent exploring outdoors, which they believe was healthier than the sheltered lives of today's children. However, these adults often forget that they are the ones who have created this protective environment for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book contains strong arguments. She discusses the fear of outdoor dangers and how it benefits the toy and gadget industry, which sells products to keep children entertained indoors. She also criticizes trends like prescribing medication for restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. While it's unclear how common these practices are, Griffiths expresses her frustration effectively. She is also inspiring when discussing childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules. However, Griffiths sometimes takes her ideas too far, ignoring important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems exaggerated.

Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children. She mostly sees them in an idealized way, which might not hold up in real life. She believes children should have the freedom to explore and take risks, arguing that they need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children may want the adventurous life she describes. What about those who are naturally timid or prefer staying indoors? Perhaps the real mistake is forcing all children into the same mold, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I've spent a lot of time in school. I'm good at solving problems, both at work and in life, but this isn't because of my schooling. Most life problems can't be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences are found in play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young, and those with more to learn play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills for children to learn for a happy, productive, moral life can't be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is crucial for economic success. We don't need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate obstacles, we'll have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are those who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam and catching it, then thinking about the consequences. We can't teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling focused on imposed questions with one right answer. More important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit anytime. If you can't quit, it's not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue the game. This makes play the most democratic activity. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and pressure for high grades has grown. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults present have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene rather than let children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant over time. They result from social factors like parents' fears, experts warning about dangers, declining neighborhood cohesion, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children don't need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to follow their natural drive to play and explore, so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow direct contact with potential employers, similar to standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, this access also increases the risk of mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to access her influential contacts. The executive, offended by the request, not only declined but also sent a sarcastic rejection note that went viral. This incident highlights the importance of using social media carefully in a professional context. Social media can be risky for job seekers who misuse it, and many are making errors. Ironically, social media has been central to the social lives of twentysomethings for years. It was once a place to impress and experiment, often based on fantasy. However, using social media for professional networking is different, and some young people struggle to see this distinction. Our early online presence was bold and confident, which might explain why some still think this approach works. But what worked on Facebook doesn't necessarily work on LinkedIn. We need to meet employers' standards to succeed in the job market. Employers often complain that young job seekers on professional sites are too familiar and seem arrogant, reinforcing the stereotype of an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are desperate for jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This perceived arrogance can harm their job prospects, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees. So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly introduce yourself and explain what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of a positive response. Avoid impersonal, generic messages, and keep a humble tone to prevent negative reactions. Remember, social media can help make valuable connections, but it requires careful use to avoid closing doors."
90,"Text: Predicting the future of newspapers is uncertain. Looking at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in decline. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main news source for only 26% of citizens, down from 45% in 2001. Many predict that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were outdated, yet theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio thrived alongside TV, and cinema has persisted against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media, taking centuries to become the main news source. This was partly due to technological advances like the steam press, railway, and telegraph in the mid-19th century. Equally important was the new idea that the world is constantly changing and we need regular updates, a concept unfamiliar in medieval times. Today, we expect change. Medieval people saw life as cyclical, marked by seasons and unpredictable disasters like famine or disease. Journalism as a profession barely existed before the 19th century, and there was little reason for regular news updates. Regular newspaper publication can be limiting. Online news allows readers to access information as needed, with search engines and algorithms personalizing news to individual interests. Internet news can provide minute-by-minute updates, correct errors quickly, and offer detailed analysis without space limits. However, online news often focuses on being first, generating comments, and creating noise, rather than spreading understanding. In medieval times, news was shared in noisy marketplaces or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. We seem to be returning to that environment. Newspapers have struggled to explain how the world works. They might face extinction, or they might find a role in guiding us to wisdom and understanding in a chaotic world."
91,"Text: 'If humans were truly comfortable under the moon and stars, we would move through the night with ease, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many nocturnal animals do. However, we are creatures of the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This is a fundamental part of our biology, even if we don't often think of ourselves this way. This explains why we have transformed the night by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to damming a river, bringing benefits but also consequences, known as light pollution. Scientists are just beginning to study its effects. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, which lets artificial light spread into the sky instead of focusing it downward. This poorly directed light brightens the night, disrupting the natural light levels and rhythms that many life forms, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would have been meaningless. Imagine approaching London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's largest city. Nearly a million people lived there, relying on candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and public gaslights wouldn't appear for another seven years. From a distance, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We've illuminated the night as if it were empty, but it's far from that. Among mammals alone, the number of nocturnal species is remarkable. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. This attraction is so strong that scientists describe songbirds and seabirds as being 'captured' by searchlights or gas flares, circling until they fall. Birds migrating at night often collide with brightly lit buildings; young birds on their first journey are especially vulnerable. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours due to artificial light. It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need an unobstructed view of the night sky for work, but like other creatures, we need darkness. Ignoring darkness is pointless. It is as vital to our health as light; disrupting our internal clock can cause health issues. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping reflects the Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so essential that disturbing them is like changing our balance. Ultimately, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs near a lit highway. Living in our own glare, we have disconnected from our evolutionary and cultural roots—the stars and the natural day-night cycle. Light pollution makes us lose sight of our true place in the universe, forgetting our scale, which is best understood under a deep night sky with the Milky Way above.'"
92,"The founder of a large multinational company recently announced that his company will stop tracking employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder said the idea came from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by his media team. Ignoring the way the announcement was made, we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn't harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads. The founder of the multinational said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team are up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much you prepare, work piles up when you're on holiday. This is just how leave works; you pause your work, but it keeps accumulating. Someone following these rules might not take leave at all or feel guilty about it. Guilt can lead to stress, and not taking enough leave can reduce productivity over time. There might also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who takes time off and for how long. This pressure already affects when people start and end their workday. In the corporate world, there's a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where employees compete for promotions. If the security of statutory leave is removed, people might feel they can't take the leave they need, fearing they look lazy. They wouldn't have their legal rights to rely on. The policy might cause workers to feel unable to take leave or continue using their statutory rights as a guide, making the policy pointless. Modern technology blurs the line between work and leisure, as we can receive work messages anytime, anywhere. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees questioned how this new work style fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours accurately, why use an outdated standard for time off? However, without set working hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might not know if their hours are monitored, leading them to self-discipline, which can be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is vital for mental and physical health. The benefits of increased morale, creativity, and productivity from unlimited leave can exist without harming worker well-being. I doubt that ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Text: 'Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in the same field evaluate a scientific research paper. It is seen as a quality check for research, aiming to prevent flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often reassure the public about its importance. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trustworthy literature? The answer is both yes and no. Examining these issues reveals much about the changing state of scientific publishing. I am not ready to abandon journal-based peer review. I believe all papers should go through some checking before formal publication, but I see changes happening. The rise of preprints—drafts of papers posted online without peer review—is a key part of this change. Preprints focus on quickly sharing new results so they can be read, critiqued, and built upon. Journal publication has become more about reputation and career advancement, which affects both authors' motivations and reviewers' roles. Competition for spots in top journals pushes scientists to do their best work, but also encourages cutting corners, as stories without inconvenient data are more likely to be published. Reviewers now often decide if a manuscript is suitable for the journal, not just if it is good. For top journals, this can depend on how newsworthy a paper is, not just its scientific quality. These issues are known, but few are willing to change the system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a major shift from the norm. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they are not universally used. This slow adoption is due to scientists' conservatism and the misconception that journals won't accept papers posted as preprints. There is also fear that publishing without peer review will lead to 'junk science,' but this hasn't happened yet. Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but authors know they will be critiqued by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience: 'My paper critiqued a published paper, which is difficult in traditional journals. With anonymous peer review, the original authors might block criticism, or they might not be chosen and could complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their points. All comments are public, so readers can judge the arguments' quality. Rejection by journals is less of a concern since the preprint and comments are public, so our work isn't wasted.' Preprint archives allow global scientific discussions that were once private. They could also be a place for negative results, an important part of science often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing their effectiveness in sharing research. By using the web's openness and the collaborative spirit in science, preprints can help focus on the work itself, not where it is published.'"
94,"When I ask my literature students to define a poem, they often say it’s like ‘a painting in words’. These answers rarely satisfy anyone. One day, I asked them to choose an object and write two paragraphs: one describing it scientifically, and another from the object's perspective, titled ‘Poem’. A student wrote: 

Poem: I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. 

The object? An oxygen mask. This unusual choice helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise sparked laughter and meaningful discussion. 

In school, poetry often seemed confusing to me, like a puzzle blocking true understanding and emotion. After school, many people lose interest in poetry. Occasionally, you encounter a poem, and it stands out because it’s not continuous prose. It challenges you to read it, and often leaves you feeling let down or confused. Still, you feel good for trying. 

What do we seek in poems? Aren’t they meant to hold deep feelings, vivid images, tender thoughts, or sharp wit? The answer seems to be yes. But for tears, we turn to films; for information or critique, we read articles. Novels offer escape, paintings please the eye, and music combines lyrics, instruments, and melody in a sublime way. 

Yet, a poem offers something unique: ambiguity. Life is full of it, unlike straightforward reading. But this doesn’t fully explain what a poem is. An online search for ‘poem’ leads to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of literary art using aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language’. This academic definition misses the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ 

So, if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes liken poems to wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or to machines – precise and engineered. But these comparisons don’t hold up under scrutiny. The value in comparing poems lies in the discussion it provokes. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you view machines or wild animals. It helps the mind explore new ways of thinking, making us see familiar things differently. 

The idea of a poem as a mental object is not far-fetched, especially when we think of how song lyrics stick in our minds. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? 

Consider a poem in a newspaper or magazine: it can impact you like nothing else, even though it’s just ink on paper like the prose around it. What about the white space around the poem – space that could be used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article, story, or novel, but it doesn’t become a commodity like they do. Publishers promote poetry collections, but few expect them to cover printing costs. A poem is not for the marketplace, but for its own sake. Because of its special status in a magazine or book, a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money and could have been used for something more practical for the house. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has brought me joy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much. 

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. It was raining, so I chose a closer spot known for old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a metre and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous Iron Age necklace in the British Museum. 

I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in the kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in over 2,000 years. ‘Marion!’ I called, ‘I've got something for you.’ She came in, stopped, and asked, ‘What is it?’ I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been burgled, but I was anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there. 

The law says such finds must be reported within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was authenticated and sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask, ‘Now that you've found something so amazing, will you stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing—not when there's a chance of catching an even bigger one tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite parts of traveling, but I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When friends describe their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian sheets? Better sleep is a happy side effect of travel. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—over 12 hours most days. Despite noisy birds nearby, I could sleep deeply and dreamily, more than I thought possible. Free from alarms and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I think there's more to it than just relaxing. I believe sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. Traveling exposes us to new sights, sounds, and smells. We absorb new cultures, music, and landscapes. Sleep helps us process this flood of new experiences, making it more intense. Sleep also changes with each place. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. In Trinidad, for example, people wake early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to adjust to this pattern. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, where I shared a big meal with new friends. After eating, we all relaxed on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows around. I joined in and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta, sharing not just sleep but a piece of Dominican life. Travel sleep is memorable. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my dreams. If 'slow travel' means savoring every experience rather than rushing, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said diplomatically to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking a bit like a bulldog. ""But it's so boring,"" she complained. ""Everyone will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she decided, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen, whose thirtieth birthday was today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about Jen's friend, Tattie, whom they knew nothing about. When Jen had called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia's husband Jeff had questioned the name. ""Tattie?"" he said. ""What sort of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" Jeff, who disliked anything pretentious, had no patience for affectation. He also believed in speaking his mind, unlike Mia, who he thought was too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat, perhaps even suggesting a dustbin lid would suit her better. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed her shop and entered Medlar House through the back door. Her commute was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to convert the unused barn next to their house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends that there was a demand for the perfect hat for special occasions. She was right. After Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats became a success. Women traveled from afar to her showroom in Little Pelham, where they could try on as many hats as needed in a relaxed setting. She encouraged customers to bring their outfits to ensure a perfect match. Recently, she expanded her business to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"Text: 'Lawrence Okoye has traveled a long way from London to Atlanta, reflecting on his remarkable sports journey. Despite never having played American football, he is likely to be chosen for a major USA team. In Atlanta, he is learning the responsibilities of his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be selected for a top American team is surprising, but Lawrence is used to defying expectations. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but postponed it to focus on discus, after playing rugby. Within 20 months, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, aiming for the world championships. He confirms his sudden interest in an NFL contract: ‘American football was in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. At school in London, it seemed crazy.’ Soon after arriving, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Despite never playing the game, he applied and was chosen as the most impressive player in tests and drills. ‘I was very pleased to hear that,’ he says, showing rare pride. However, he is cautious, acknowledging his lack of experience. ‘Coaches say I have the attributes needed. It’s about how hard I work,’ he explains. He remains calm about the selection process: ‘There’s no pressure on me. People say I’ll be selected, but I’m not too worried.’ This calmness might stem from his Olympic disappointment, where he finished last in the discus final. He has moved past this, proud of qualifying for the final with an impressive last throw. ‘That was an amazing day,’ he recalls. ‘The final didn’t go as planned, but that’s sport. I can return to it.’ After the Olympics, some thought the experience had affected him, but Lawrence doesn’t comment. The minimum NFL salary is over $400,000 a year, making the financial benefits clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on one sport? ‘I understand why someone would say that,’ he replies. ‘I’m trying to achieve a dream I’ve had since school. If it doesn’t work out, I can return to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought through.’'"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, winter had not yet arrived in Siberia. I saw no signs of human life, just an endless view of mountains, streams, and forests. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said in a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow traveling to remote areas to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I told him I believed there was a road, though not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, I will be riding with a friend named Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked doubtful and pointed outside, saying ""Holodna"" (cold). I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had warm clothes, though I didn't mention that my trip was self-funded and I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at discounted prices. I wasn't sure they would be adequate, especially my large postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats, some taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was fulfilling. It was challenging, rarely boring, and there were long holidays for adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more relaxing than teaching: cycling around the world. Since our first ride together, Al had been setting himself greater challenges. This round-the-world bike trip was his greatest so far. At times, he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge, even if it seemed impossible. He was proving the skeptics wrong. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to participate. An hour before the flight, I signed two forms. The first confirmed I was in good health, and the second required me to empty my pockets, as small objects can become dangerous during the flight. I learned I needed to stay oriented. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" I was told, and the pilot would guide me on where to look. I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. 

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing and was told not to touch anything. As we taxied down the runway, my legs were up, trying not to touch the steering pedals, and my hands avoided the switches. My mind was made up: I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right times. Panicking is not an option. 

Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we immediately banked sharply to the right. It was a sudden, intense move, and I felt the air squeeze out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned sharply left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for the small gap between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even started the acrobatics yet.

For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too—it’s that responsive. Then Dario said something, and I asked him to repeat it. Instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. ""Yup,"" I replied. ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle. I know many people find this thrilling, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I found it overwhelming. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what pilots endure in races. To illustrate, Dario ate sandwiches right after we landed. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed of doing loops repeatedly."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you've ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. His ideal temperature, he says, is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about surviving in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ""I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realized that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater."" He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ""I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film."" The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ""It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material."" ""My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes."" Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ""We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,"" he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ""Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats."" Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without receiving supplies along the way. This involved swimming through extremely cold waters and facing dangers like frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers are confident and driven, and Pen is no exception. This time, however, the stakes are higher. Pen and two colleagues will embark on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be crucial for scientists. This will provide the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this kind of work. As a child, he was cared for by his father's former nanny, who had worked for the famous explorer Scott of the Antarctic. She toughened him up by sending him out into the Scottish mountains during blizzards with minimal clothing. His father also passed on a love for icy adventures, and Pen developed exceptional physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman who says he has a ""spine of steel"" and shares his love for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and worries more about him when he's at home, saying, ""He's in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he's somewhere in the Arctic."" For fun, she once competed against him in a mountain event where riders on horseback race against people on foot, and she finished an hour ahead of him. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ""It's much harder to be away from them this time,"" he admits. ""They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in how I said goodbye. I told my son, 'You're the man of the house now, look after your mum and sister.' He took it seriously, but it was too much pressure. It was well-intentioned but unfair."" For similar reasons, he plans to have little contact with them while in the Arctic. ""If you call them, you remind them how far away you are."" He is spending his last days before departure preparing his equipment meticulously. ""On the ice, you can't fix things or do anything complicated,"" he says. Joining him will be Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the expedition photographer. They will be supported by a crew of six, flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for someone like Pen, and he has other concerns too. ""I'm turning 47 on Thursday. I've done less training than I'd like."" Why? ""Organizational tasks always seem more urgent. So I'm almost afraid of what I'll demand of myself."" Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the quest for knowledge that inspired past explorers. ""Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,"" he admits, ""and of limited value beyond the adventuring community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we're engaging as many people as possible in what's happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,"" he says. ""Our skills, which seemed odd and unnecessary, are now crucial. Suddenly, we're useful again."""
103,"Text: I took a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Although these activities were great, I missed having something competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape in case I decided to try for the Olympics again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I have always loved rowing and missed the feeling of the boat moving through the water. However, I wasn't ready to train seven days a week. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked my rowing friends if they were interested in the race, but no one was enthusiastic. I knew that if I entered, I would want to win, even though it was mainly an adventure. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? Probably not. But being an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We discussed the remaining costs; the boat and equipment alone would cost £70,000 – a huge amount. We thought we had a better chance than most, but it would still take effort to secure it. Besides the race expenses, I also had to consider the loss of earnings from being away. Speaking at business conferences is one of the most profitable ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It's flattering that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn't just be talking about past successes. I'd be doing something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My Olympic preparation was tough, but looking back, it was straightforward. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the program was set, with doctors and dieticians. I was concerned about people's reactions to me racing with a TV presenter. I worried it would seem like I just wanted to be on TV, otherwise, I would have chosen a better partner to win the race. My concerns faded during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had completed the tough Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and a year on a deserted island. However, he couldn't row. I was surprised by how little natural feel he had for a boat, and he was surprised by my lack of sympathy. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest with Ben about the improvements he needed. I should have realized his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty, perhaps as a reaction to the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, deep in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to over 100. Recently, they took over a second property, the 'wilderness farm', which they described as a picturesque but basic outpost with unreliable electricity and no running water. They said I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing immediately.

November 6, London On my flight, I stare blankly at a page with over 100 husky photos; I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and panicky. I put the page down and look out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, a wave of blooming flowers and leaves. But I think I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing.

November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests—thin conifers weighed down by snow—stopping occasionally to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely through the door when I’m handed a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes a wall of noise by the time I reach the dogsheds. Three people are running back and forth, pulling out huskies and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, straining against the ropes to get going. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much anyway. I stand on the sidelines and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently—'Get in!’—and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command rings out, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a discouraging questioning about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m stumped. I don’t know. Am I? Further questioning reveals that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become difficult in sub-zero conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions, and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds—and from being dragged around by overenthusiastic huskies. But I am triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’"
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe sprinted past the finish line, the press gathered to understand her extraordinary run. Her time was so impressive that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman, to heal injuries from a training accident. Radcliffe says the achievement never really sank in. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but at the time, it felt like just another race. Her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried she might not maintain her pace and could drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, though he admitted that anyone unaware of her fitness might think starting so fast was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe calculated she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers at high speed but still sprinted the last stretch in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run quicker than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't expect anyone to match that time soon, but Radcliffe thought, ‘I'm going to come back and do it next year.’ Unfortunately, that didn't happen. After the race, people wondered how an athlete with such an awkward style beat the grace and skill of East African runners. Hartmann had spent weeks with Radcliffe, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could take that level of pain. She would wear me down because I'd have to go so deep into her muscles, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted with, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no greeting or offer of tea. She was ready for a two-hour session. During that time, Hartmann gave so much attention to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I trained hard, but others are more talented. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people race each other more than themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never easing up, even when you've won, probably pushed me. I never thought, “I can relax,” it was always: “keep pushing.”’ Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was her career peak. She never ran as fast again, but she inspired many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cookery programme, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was unsure how viewers and the press would react. At the time, there was much discussion about the food 'revolution' in Britain, and I believed our series made a truly innovative contribution. However, I was concerned whether people would appreciate a cooking approach that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science. I watched the first episode with mixed feelings of joy and fear. I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other exciting projects, including a book based on my restaurant experiences. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection,' each with its own TV programme. In these, the journey was often physical, involving travel and exploration. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet extraordinary artisans, like a man dedicated to creating the best-tasting golden pasta. These individuals have spent years pursuing their own ideals of perfection. Perfection is subjective. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was challenging, and I knew some people would be disappointed by the omissions. Despite this, after intense discussions, the TV production team and I created a list that offered something for everyone. This confirmed my belief that each person has their own idea of perfection, influenced by emotions, memories, and surroundings. Although the book's title suggests otherwise, I never claimed the recipes were 'definitive.' I believed that by using my technical skills and scientific knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means refining through continuous experimentation. Trying ideas and revising them until they become unique. The TV series allowed me to explore foods, people, and places I hadn't encountered before, which excited me as much as exploring memory and nostalgia in food. Searching for the best ingredients took me worldwide. My adventures included visiting a canning factory processing the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm with standards so low we had to stop filming. Refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanner, and nearly burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still hours from Marrakech when the van suddenly made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and looked under the bonnet. He stood there for a long time, looking at the engine with his hands in his pockets, appearing confident. Eventually, he admitted, ""Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,"" and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried, ""We can’t stay here forever,"" she said. The field stretched out endlessly, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. ""No, we can’t stay here forever,"" I repeated, agreeing with Bea. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We watched John walk away, getting smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass. ""Tell us a story,"" she said. Bea lay down next to her. ""Go on, tell us a story."" So I told them about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I shared everything the birds discussed: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and a fight over a worm. ""That’s silly, no one understands bird language,"" Bea said. My eyes stung. ""I do."" But my voice wasn’t convincing. ""Liar."" I blushed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ""Mum...?"" But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John returned with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea refused to get out. The boys didn’t mind and waved and smiled at her through the back door windows. We followed John into a tiled café, not far from where our van was parked. ""It’s a hotel,"" John whispered. ""It might be expensive."" ""We’ll just have some tea,"" Mum reassured him, and we sat in the shade of the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ""It’s like syrup in there,"" she said. We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the engine. ""It’s a miracle it got us this far,"" he said as it got dark. Mum spread blankets on the ground for us to sleep in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ""I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,"" John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later, we were in a truck watching our van being towed with John at the wheel. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we’d get home since our van needed towing. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. Unlike her, they were not competing. One was a man from Tokyo, and the other was a woman from a European city, whose name Lucy didn't catch due to the noise. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the pieces they were playing, their recent travels, and future plans. 

""I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,"" Lucy told them. It sounded impressive, though she didn't really want to go. She hadn't wanted to do many of the things that filled her schedule: concerts and competitions that took her around the world, causing her to miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group worldwide. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. There was a celebration. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant, and her little brother Gus dreamed of attending the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her repertoire. The thing was, Lucy hadn't applied. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. ""I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,"" her mom had said. Lucy thought it was more about not giving her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn't even think about trying to get out of it.

The man from Tokyo leaned forward, surprised. ""Tanglewood?"" ""Yeah."" ""How old are you?"" ""Fifteen."" He exchanged a glance with the woman, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy hadn't meant to brag. It was hard to find the balance between sharing her achievements to fit in and showing off. ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying..."" ""Excuse me,"" the woman said, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The man from Tokyo stayed. ""Have you ever been to Japan?"" He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were rebel music nerds. ""Once. When I was, like, eight."" He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone."" He took her arm and led her away. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition."" ""They're not the competition."" ""Everyone is the competition."" Her grandfather took her around the room, making her talk to everyone he thought was important. Lucy smiled and nodded, only half-listening. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ""You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" She liked that part—being somebody. Even if it meant some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn't earn her any special respect from her schoolmates. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘Spending too much time online isn’t good for you. You need to experience the real world,’ said Dad. He’s hard to argue with, so I looked into what experts say about it – and it’s quite interesting. Research generally shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are developing important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is now a key part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just use media like adults do for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails – they live in it. It’s not about whether it’s good or bad, but how you use it.’ How does our social networking compare to what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at the youth club, as today’s parents did when they were younger, to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. It helps teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and interact with peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time for asking, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity: you can share your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see that others have different perspectives. Research shows that active social networkers are less self-absorbed than those who don’t use social media.’ He adds that social media can help if you’re shy: ‘Communicating online can be more comfortable than face-to-face, and it can be beneficial to practice social skills in a less intimidating environment.’ Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how younger people use social networking sites. He believes they can help quiet people with specific interests connect with others who share those interests. ‘If you’re one of only a few people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel isolated. But if you find a social networking group of similar people, you can still be popular, just in a different context,’ he says. Pauline White, a digital education expert, shared something interesting: ‘People your age who find new interests online, join networks of like-minded individuals, and create their own content are really using the potential of social networks.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasting, and blogging about their interests. Photo-sharing sites, she says, are transforming creativity. Enthusiastic photographers can connect, learn skills, exchange images, and deepen their interest. ‘This all adds to employability and will be beneficial in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness – and you need to understand how it works to create customers. For example, if you develop a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they’re all potential customers. If you link all those networks, there’s your customer base.’ Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they enter the workforce, agrees Matthews. ‘One great aspect of many sites is the chance to collaborate with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is a key 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age.’"""
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, a cross-country trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first idea. However, my parents had a different plan for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to organize what many teenagers might consider a nightmare: the ultimate family bonding trip. ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" my parents kept saying before the trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There must be good reasons why!"" In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home for more ""cozy"" places over the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into. We headed west, through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even close to home, we had adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way! The next day, we were up at dawn and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what was to come. Climbing the mountains to our next stop, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dodging construction traffic became normal. We laughed as we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" managed by park volunteers, were common as traffic stopped to let bears cross. Our own close encounter with a bear on the road (and a nervous park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its inconveniences, couldn't dampen our spirits. It was a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service, but it offered the most amazing views. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic foreign place to find something amazing. It was bittersweet to be home again, but at least I hadn't argued with my brother during our hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos of our journey to look through and remember. For me, the most memorable parts were the unplanned and spontaneous moments.'"
111,"Rose Frost, at sixteen, was moving to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Her family was separating for two years because her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, was joining him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school under the care of the college Head, as moving would disrupt her studies. She was thrilled to have the best room at the college, complete with a kitchen, study area, and free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still keep an eye on Amy.

Rose was going to her grandmother’s house. She had only vague holiday memories of Daisy and had never met her grandfather. Although Rose's parents were not keen on the idea, Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was eager to reconnect with her granddaughter. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents had issues with Daisy, but there had been a past disagreement that led to spending holidays elsewhere. Rose’s last memory of Daisy was from when she was ten, and it was a happy one.

Dahlia mentioned that living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and loved bringing people together. Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips soon. This made Rose smile, as Daisy was not the typical frail grandmother. She seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England.

Before moving, Dahlia and Rose had a talk. Rose was mature and knew about healthy living. She wanted independence, like playing music loudly, inviting friends over, or going out without always asking for permission. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood this. Dahlia gave Rose a new touch-screen phone for emergencies, which made Rose very happy. They agreed on trust: Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be overbearing. If issues arose, they would discuss them.

Rose was not a rebellious child. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her case. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, make new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. This would be her last move, as she was starting her final two years of school. For Rose, it was a new chapter in her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She recalls thinking that writing a book would be a great achievement, as it seemed challenging. At 13, she decided to give it a try. Now, the novel she started then is about to be published. When she told her former teacher, the teacher was surprised, having expected Charlotte to write a book much later in life. Charlotte couldn't understand why she should wait to pursue something she might be good at.

On a winter afternoon at her publisher's office, I was surprised to see a teenager, even though I knew I was interviewing a 15-year-old author. Her book is impressive, with a confident and action-packed narrative. Nothing, except the heroine's age, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is present, but Charlotte doesn't need any support. She is spirited, intelligent, and steady, avoiding overconfidence.

Charlotte recognizes her youth's limitations. When asked about the complex moral issues in her book, she says she wanted to ask big questions, not answer them. She laughs, admitting she has few life lessons to offer readers. She doesn't think her age limits her understanding of the world, but she doesn't claim to be particularly wise. She was interested in exploring responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in fiction. She believes there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager unaware of the world, and the socially awkward character. She found these stereotypes frustrating. She wonders why there aren't more stories about teenagers who are fine as they are. She feels that some writers unintentionally suggest teenagers can't know themselves due to inexperience, which can undermine their confidence.

Charlotte has always enjoyed reading famous fantasy writers, though they almost discouraged her from writing. Their books explore deep psychological and life themes, making her question if she could do the same. However, she praises a book called ""How Not to Write a Novel,"" which advises that if readers can predict the plot, the suspense is lost.

Some might argue that having journalist parents helped Charlotte get published, as her father's connection in publishing got her book read. She acknowledges her luck, as getting a first novel read is difficult at any age. She believes every writer needs support and a lucky break, but success ultimately depends on talent. Charlotte doesn't take her success for granted."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping and wanted to show his skills, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump, hit the ramp fast, and flew into the air, arms flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly informed us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I lacked the skills and feared ridicule. Then my parents decided on a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a huge indoor facility with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow, where students practiced new tricks and landed in foam pits – not a realistic introduction to the slopes. After practicing indoors, students tried their moves outside. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan assured us. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again. Land in the zone and you continue forward, minimizing impact. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain and race towards the jump. My legs would almost go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt several centimeters shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, but bouncing was addictive. Some drills copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body is doing in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We returned to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as delighted as I was, and for a moment I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that was short-lived. On the final run of the day, I kept my speed as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer attached to my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and your nails dig into the harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There's a pause, then a sharp drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, then go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park. It's interesting that amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are such a big industry. Behind the scenes, large teams of creative engineers and designers work to provide the excitement and escape that visitors want. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's a real challenge. Designers must create the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe, and they need to add new features to keep visitors interested. Although people might think rollercoasters have become more intense, many techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the tracks made by specialist manufacturers. I spoke to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it's about quickly switching between different forces so people feel excited but safe. The goal is to create a thrilling ride without making people feel uncomfortable. To make a great ride, teams must create a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or the most twists. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that designers need to understand what passengers want and test the rides themselves. I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add something extra, like painting an old rollercoaster, but the physical ride experience will remain the most important for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating works for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances occasionally. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it’s like to be in the studio, taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day,’ she explains. As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching and working with young students. ‘New dancers are often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re willing to take risks. They want success but don’t fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This incomplete picture of their skills means they accept even harsh criticism. They might challenge me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There might be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t just choose a new piece. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces – it would help lift the mood when rehearsals get tough. But now, I’m always working on big productions where the musical score is already set by the composer and can’t be changed.’

Miranda doesn’t want to attach herself to one institution. ‘It’s valuable to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to adapt each time I go somewhere new, rather than do the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’

We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one tries to show viewers what life inside a dance company is really like. There was a scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I smiled in recognition. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s painful to watch but not staged for the cameras. The public underestimates the work and dedication involved in ballet.’

I ask what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything – the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers – comes together. Perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. That’s disappointing.’

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to develop expertise in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, though I might one day be known for one thing. For now, I want to broaden my horizons.’"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that TV shows amazing things, but why stay at home when there’s so much to experience outside? That conversation inspired my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even spending one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and motivating me to continue. I’ve been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads, allowing me to stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino, instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website.'"
117,"When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was thrilled. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea. The man at the Greek port seemed surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although still a bit confused, he let me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group—not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, though, and was thrilled when I finally did it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in, reaching a comfortable speed, stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and enjoyment in completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year."

119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but with some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do have children who miss home at the start of the week. Surprisingly, it's not the really young ones who feel this way the most—it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to call now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days, and by the end of their week's stay, they all thank us because they have had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call all the time, asking how their child is doing, which is quite unnecessary. Often their son or daughter is busy playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back later. We often get a certain type of child coming, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors must also be skilled musicians, opened in London last year after five years in the USA, where it was voted ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, using an all-British cast was challenging. The UK has stricter rules on how many performances young actors can do weekly compared to the USA, where they can perform more often. Because of this, twice as many actors were needed in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented UK-based actors, and they’ve just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. Although the London theatre is larger than the US venue, it’s been full every night, with everyone eager to hear the songs that first became popular in America. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He explained how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons each day at the theatre. While the teacher is great, I miss my old school friends.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre offers special deals on tickets for schools. They absolutely loved it, which made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I mentioned I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play along with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I didn’t know. Jamie guided me through it, and I was very pleased when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! While the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they’ve found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the hard part was appearing natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show’s on in London for another year and is well worth seeing.'"
