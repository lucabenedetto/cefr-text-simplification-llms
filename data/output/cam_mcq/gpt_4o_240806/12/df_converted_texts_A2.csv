1,"Text: 'Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins – telling everyone online where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just saying, ‘Hey, I’m here’ – but you are also telling everyone, even people you don’t know. This made people think that sharing too much online might not be good. The internet lets us share everything about our lives with many people. This can be exciting: maybe we can become rich or famous! So, we share our secrets, photos, and stories online. But later, we might find out that it is not safe, and we feel lost. Is this sad? Maybe, but don’t worry. There is a way to understand this. A long time ago, some people started sharing their lives online. They learned about the dangers before social media was popular. These people, called bloggers, have already experienced what we are going through now. We should learn from them. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ‘WWW’, which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at Cern, a lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He wrote about himself and shared photos and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people read about his life. Hall shared everything: if you met him, you might be on his site; no topic was off-limits. One day, his website disappeared, and there was only a sad video called Dark Night. He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told ‘either the blog goes, or I do’. He learned that sharing too much online can make people not trust you. The blog stopped, but the problem is still here. Sharing online is fun. But if you think it will make people like you, you might be wrong. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, someone at her work sent her blog to the bosses, and she lost her job. People who study the internet call this the ‘online distribution effect’: we feel we can say things online that we wouldn’t say in person. But the internet is not a place where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives. If we forget this, we can make big mistakes. Armstrong’s story ended well. She was sad and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started her blog again, writing about her family. Now, she is famous among ‘mommy bloggers’ and her blog helps her family. She learned that even though we can say anything online, it doesn’t mean we should.'"
2,"Text: Some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we do not understand. Scientists usually agree with this idea because no one knows everything about the universe. However, some scientists were worried about the film and called it ""atrocious"" and ""dangerous."" 

At first, the film seemed normal. Scientists talked about how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then, the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher said that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy, and looking bad after being talked to by someone in a bad mood. Some people found this interesting, but many scientists said, ""Give me a break."" They wanted better proof.

The film's claims were not strange enough. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is expanding because of a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Other discoveries are also amazing. Neuroscientists found that our brain takes about half a second to understand what we see, but we do not notice this delay. Anthropologists think they know where modern humans first lived and why they moved to other places. Some scientists think there is a link between life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Science is not finished. We are learning more and more, and many things in nature are still hard to understand. Theories like chaos and quantum uncertainty show limits to what we can know. Some physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all forces and particles in the universe. Many people think the universe is incredible."
3,"Text: 'For me, writing novels is hard, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, and writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both are important and make a beautiful picture together. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind moves the leaves. In the garden, flowers bloom, and bees and butterflies come. Since I started writing, I have switched between novels and short stories. After I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. After I finish short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write both at the same time. Writing novels and short stories might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to change from one to the other. I started with two short novels in 1975, and then I wrote short stories from 1984 to 1985. I didn’t know much about writing short stories then, but it was a memorable experience. My world of stories grew bigger, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story book, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is nice because they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to make a short story good (though I can revise them a lot). It’s not like writing a novel, which takes a year or two. You can finish a short story quickly. Writing a novel feels like it takes forever, and I sometimes wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change. Another good thing about short stories is that you can make them from small ideas, like a word or an image. It’s like jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. If a story doesn’t work, it’s okay. Not every story is great, even for famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. This makes me feel better. You can learn from mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories. Short stories are like a test place for me as a novelist. It’s hard to try new things in a novel, so short stories help me. My short stories are like soft shadows or footprints I leave behind. I remember each one and how I felt. They are like signs to my heart, and I am happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,"Text: 'Science is a big part of our lives. It helps us understand the world and can cure diseases. Science can make life easier, but it can also be dangerous. Scientists try to understand small things like atoms and big things like the universe. Science has changed many ideas in history. Sometimes, new ideas in science are not accepted at first, but later they become important. Scientists often disagree with each other. Science is always changing. One scientist might prove another scientist wrong. This can change what we believe about the world. In the past, people thought they knew everything about physics, but then new discoveries like X-rays and the Big Bang changed that. Science is not just for scientists. It affects everyone. We need to understand science because it can change our future and the world we live in. Science is important for making decisions about health, money, and the environment. It is important for everyone to know about science, not just scientists.'"
5,"Text: 'Around 2015, big publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped growing or even went down. This made people question if ebooks would be important in the future. One publishing boss said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments. His company lost faith in the power of printed books. Even though digital and print books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace print books. This idea makes us think and talk a lot. Why do we see ebooks and print books as fighting each other? The answer is about how we feel about new things. In my research, I found that people often think new technology will replace old ones. For example, when TV was invented, people thought radio would disappear. But radio survived by finding new uses, like in cars. The idea of books disappearing is not new. In 1894, people thought phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This has happened many times. Movies, radio, TV, and smartphones were all thought to end print books. Some people worried this would hurt culture, while others thought ebooks were better. The idea of books disappearing comes up when new technology appears. This shows our mixed feelings about change. We have strong feelings for things like books and computers because they are part of our lives. When new technology comes, we have to change our connection with these things. This makes us miss what we used to have. That's why there are businesses for old products. For example, when the printing press spread in the 15th century, people wanted old manuscripts. When movies got sound in the 1920s, people missed silent films. The same happened with digital photography and CDs. E-readers made people appreciate old books more, even their smell. This should comfort those worried about print books disappearing. But the idea of disappearing media will continue to be a story about technology's power and our fear of change. We use stories to understand change, like stories of endings. The story of the death of the book shows our excitement for the future and our fear of losing what we know.'"
6,"Text: 'Almost every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I wrote about how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years found time each day to do their best work. I looked at their daily schedules to see how they were creative and productive. By writing about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I wanted to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to show that they were like us, with habits and routines. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.’ I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.’ This book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product. It’s about how people work, not what they make. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever thought that even a business letter shows something of your inner self. My book looks at questions I think about in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to focus completely on a project or to work on it a little each day? When there isn’t enough time for everything, do you give things up, or do you learn to do more in less time? I don’t have all the answers, but I give examples of how successful people faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas come from small daily actions; how your habits affect your work, and vice versa. The book’s title is Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary, but it can help you use your time, willpower, and optimism well. A good routine helps you focus and avoid being controlled by your moods. The psychologist William James thought you should put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can focus on more interesting things. Ironically, James himself was a procrastinator and couldn’t stick to a schedule. This book started from my own procrastination. One Sunday, I was at work trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a ‘morning person’ and can focus well in the morning but not after lunch. That afternoon, I searched the Internet for other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories and thought someone should collect them. So, I started the Daily Routines blog and now, this book. The blog was simple; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine profiles, and newspaper obituaries. For the book, I expanded and researched more, keeping the short and varied voices that made the blog popular. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t be possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which can also guide further reading.'"
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, decided they could not go on holiday to Spain because it was too expensive. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From that moment, he knew he wanted to study fossils. At university, he decided he wanted to study very old fossils, not dinosaurs. He liked studying small, ancient creatures in rocks.

After finishing his studies, Howard worried about finding a job. He knew he was good, but getting a job was not always fair. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London. On the day of his interview, the professor who liked another candidate had an accident and could not attend. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, helped Howard get the job. Howard was happy to get the job, even though he later learned it was because of the professors' disagreement.

Howard enjoyed his work, but he knew life could be unpredictable. One day, someone stole his briefcase with important notes. He was upset but went back to the college. There, he met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils that needed studying. This was a big opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi.

*An ammonite is a type of fossil."
8,"Charles Spence will eat almost anything. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. The larvae may look like maggots, but they taste ""slightly nutty, floral."" Making bug-eating normal is one of the many food challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. He influences what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurants. Spence and his team study how we experience food and drink. Who we eat with, how food looks and is described, the color and weight of plates and cutlery, and background noise all affect taste. Spence’s book, The Perfect Meal, written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting facts about eating. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant enjoys their food the most? Or that we eat about 35% more food when eating with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence’s lab in Oxford is simple. ""Low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff,"" he says. There are soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with cooks who can’t pay for research. Much of his work is funded by a big food company. In the past, research with industry money was seen as ""not real science"" in universities. But now, universities must show their work has an impact, so this research is important. Spence is helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar. They do it slowly, so customers don’t notice the change. ""When you tell people what you’re doing, they focus on the taste and don’t like it as much,"" he says. Spence met Heston Blumenthal, a famous chef, while working on a project. People thought ""Science and food – that’s horrible,"" but most food is scientific. Blumenthal and Spence created the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish in Blumenthal’s restaurant. Spence says that the Italian futurists were ""doing sounds of croaking frogs with frogs legs a century ago,"" but it didn’t become popular. Now the food industry uses Spence’s sensory science. His research shows that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with food for passengers. Last year, a brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream softens, but they didn’t match the music to the taste. What are dinner parties like at Spence’s home? Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled lights. ""We’ve had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and 10 different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" Home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international food conferences are all part of Spence’s lab."
9,"Text: 'Our brains are busier than ever before. We have to deal with facts, fake facts, and rumours, all pretending to be information. We need to find out what is important and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more things. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We are doing the work of many people while trying to keep up with our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and TV shows. Our smartphones help us do all this. They are part of the 21st-century habit of filling every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking – doing many things at once – but this is not true. Earl Miller, a brain expert at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching from one task to another very quickly. This switching has a cost. We are not like expert jugglers; we are more like beginners, moving from one task to another and worrying that something will go wrong. Even though we think we are doing a lot, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones, which can make our thinking unclear. Multitasking makes us want more new things, distracting us. The part of the brain we need to focus is easily distracted. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our brain performance. Glenn Wilson, a psychology expert, calls it info-mania. His research shows that trying to focus on a task while an email is unread can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This is worse than being tired. Russ Poldrack, a brain scientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to a part of the brain for skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to a part of the brain where it is easier to remember. Multitasking also needs decision-making: ‘Do I answer this text or ignore it?’ Making decisions is hard for our brains. After many small decisions, we can make bad decisions about important things. Business leaders, scientists, and writers say email is a problem. It is not about email itself, but the large amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father’s job is ‘answering emails.’ This is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other things done.'"
10,"Text: 'In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions were not important. Animals had behaviors, and science recorded what happened. The idea that animals have feelings and thoughts was not taken seriously. But recently, this has started to change. Research on bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animal emotions are now being studied. This change has led to books like Mark Bekoff’s Wild Justice and Victoria Braithwaite’s Do Fish Feel Pain?. It has started a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Cows that opened the gate themselves showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those that had help. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? The observations are clear, but people disagree on what they mean. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of Second Nature, believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks we are near a big change in how we treat animals. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, says we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. The disagreement is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an experiment with starlings, a type of bird, that he thinks shows they can get depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were put in two groups. One group had nice cages with space and water. The other group had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid bad worms from another. Later, when only bad worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages ate them. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt pessimistic. Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, believes we will one day see our treatment of animals as wrong, like racism. If he were alone in this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning has written a book, An Introduction to Animal Behaviour. He says we are changing how we think about animals. It is a difficult topic, and people have strong opinions.'"
11,"Text: Critical thinking is a way to understand better what we read or hear. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that argument helps find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might change how we solve problems. We see a lot of poor thinking and opinions, which can confuse us. More data does not always mean better knowledge or decisions. Reading books has gone down, says the National Endowment for the Arts. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, thinks less reading might mean less critical thinking. People focus more on quick media and doing many things at once. We do not know exactly how technology affects thinking. Computers and the internet can be good or bad for thinking. For example, a computer game might help or hurt critical thinking. Reading online can help analyze, but too many links can stop deep thinking. Greenfield says technology changes how we think. Reading helps imagination and critical thinking more than video games and TV. But visual media can improve some information skills. Most visual media do not give time for thinking or imagination. This can make people, especially young ones, not use their full abilities. How we see technology affects how we think about critical thinking. Video games and thinking skills are a big topic. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says video games can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and thinking skills. They let people explore ideas in a virtual world. In the digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects thinking."
12,"Text: 'Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. Before this, he worked in an office but did not like it. He wrote a book about why working with your hands is good. His new book talks about how to live in the modern world. He got the idea when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. Crawford thinks these ads make it hard for us to focus. We can't choose what to think about because of these distractions. This makes it hard to talk to people or remember things. We often use phones and apps, which can control our attention. Many people feel the same way. For example, some office workers complain about emails but still check them all the time. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford believes technology makes us focus too much on ourselves. We prefer texting to talking because it feels safer. This can make us lose real connections with people. Crawford gives an example from his gym. Before, there was one music player for everyone. Now, people use earphones and listen to their own music. This change makes the gym less social. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public. Second, we should do activities that need skill, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us connect with the real world. They make us use our judgment and work with others. This way, we can focus better and enjoy life more.'"
13,"Text: ""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question. We often talk about our jobs. But when you are a philosopher, like me, it is a bit harder to answer. Saying you are a philosopher can sound a bit too serious. People might think you have special knowledge. But philosophers are just like everyone else. So, why do people think philosophers are different? One reason is that philosophers think a lot about life and ideas. A Greek philosopher, Aristotle, said that thinking about life is the best way to live. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that we should think about our lives to make them better. This does not mean you have to read many books or think all the time. It just means looking at your life and making sure it is good. Philosophy should help people in their daily lives. But today, philosophy in universities is often very complicated. It is hard for people who are not experts to understand. This is because philosophers write in expensive journals that not everyone can read. So, philosophy seems far from real life. I sometimes call myself an ""ethicist"" because I study ethics, which is about what is right and wrong. But ethics is not just about rules and laws. It is also about thinking deeply about our actions. For example, we might ask if downloading movies illegally is wrong. Then, we can think about responsibility and our views on art. Philosophy helps us look closely at our lives. Sometimes we find out things we already know. Other times, we learn new things. By thinking about these ideas, we can help everyone."
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like chefs and food lovers, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. But in history, talking about food was often used to talk about other things, like learning. Sometimes, when people talked about food, they were really talking about other ideas. An interesting example is the Greek philosopher Epicurus. He talked about enjoying life and avoiding pain in many ways. But today, his name is often linked to enjoying food and drink. We see his name in restaurants and food shops because they think it will help them sell more. Food is social and cultural. It comes from history and is shared with people around us. We eat with others and get our food from our communities. We deal with food more than any other thing, so it is a good topic to think about. After food is made, people talk and write about it. But why do some people have a special status when they talk about food? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill, but some people are just better at describing it. Most studies about how we see things focus on vision, not taste, and this should change. Another part of food is how it looks and feels. We say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers think food should be part of this talk because of modern cooking. But food is eaten and gone, unlike art or music, which lasts. There are also many questions about what we should eat, like organic or vegetarian food. Our choices show our beliefs, and philosophers ask why we choose what we do. Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a duty to their guests because of love and friendship. In restaurants, cooks have duties to their boss and the food. Their kitchens are for trained people, not everyone. A recent essay talks about how food can help connect different cultures. We can learn about others by enjoying their food and eating together, which has been important in diplomacy. The essay uses fun stories to show this part of food philosophy to readers.'"
15,"Text: 'Rob Daviau, from the US, makes special board games called ‘legacy’ games. He thought the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a story. Could choices in one game affect the next game? He changed a classic game called Risk to make Risk Legacy. In this game, choices have a lasting effect. Players might tear up cards or write on the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players remember past actions. Daviau also worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players cure diseases. His next game was SeaFall, set in the age of sail. Players explore new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how games work. Jaime Barriga tested SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it breaks, and they have to fix it. Legacy games were not expected to be popular. Daviau thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved them. He thinks they are a big step forward in game design. Ben Hogg, another fan, likes the adventure in these games. He says it’s like watching a new movie each time. Legacy games are like video games and TV shows with episodes. Daviau wanted to write for TV but ended up in game design. He likes telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock says making a legacy game is like writing a book. You need to know the start and end. Daviau is excited to see what others do with his idea. But he thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works with SeaFall, thinks legacy games change how we see board games.'"
16,"Text: 'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online. People like stories about animals escaping, like rats and llamas, because they seem like us. Octopuses are very smart, even though they look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor. Some people think it is unscientific to say animals are like humans. But Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas, says it is wrong to ignore the human-like traits of animals. He calls this 'anthropodenial.' He says animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. In the past, people thought animals were smart. In medieval times, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, who created the theory of evolution, said the difference between humans and animals is not big. In the 20th century, people started to see animals as machines that respond to rewards and punishments. But now, de Waal believes we are starting to see animals as smart again. He says we are learning more about animal intelligence. The best tests for animal intelligence consider the animal's special skills. For example, squirrels can remember where they hide nuts, even if they fail human memory tests. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, Sy Montgomery says if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we are not smart because we cannot change our skin color. De Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean. But he knows that stories like Inky's help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment with monkeys to see if they feel envy. Monkeys given cucumbers got upset when others got grapes, which they liked more. A video of this experiment convinced many people of the findings. This shows how our minds work.'"
17,"Text: 'Robots were once only in science fiction books, but now they are becoming very important. Robots have been used in car factories for many years. Now, experts say robots will soon be used in many more jobs, and many countries are not ready for this big change. Many people think robots will do most jobs in the next 50 years, but they also think their own jobs will still be there. This is not true. All job areas will change because of robots. For example, an Australian company made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This is much faster than two people can do in a day. In San Francisco, a robot called Tally checks that supermarket shelves are full and prices are correct. People who like robots say they will create new jobs for people who can fix and program them. But some people worry that we will lose important human skills at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots will change jobs. He says that soon, many robots will be able to work with people safely. In a few years, big companies will have a special manager for robots, and some governments will make new rules for robots. In five years, salaries in the robot industry will go up, but many jobs will not be filled because there are not enough skilled workers. Dr. Zhang says people need to learn new skills because they cannot do the same job forever. New robots will also be made for homes, and they will be very advanced. This is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future with robots. Countries need more people studying science, technology, engineering, and maths, known as STEM, to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountain climber, was once asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He answered, ""Because it's there."" Many people wonder why someone would do something so dangerous. Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams. It shows that climbing can be about adventure and fun. 

In 1967, a writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay about climbing. He said there are seven different types of climbing, each with its own rules. The way people climb depends on these rules. This idea is now very popular among climbers in the West. Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. But sometimes, climbing can feel limiting, like when a storm keeps you stuck in a tent. This is a bit of a puzzle, but some say that having fewer choices can also feel like freedom.

Another climber, Joe Fitschen, thinks we should ask, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is in our nature. We like to take on challenges, even if they are risky. This means climbing is more about our biology than thinking it through.

Brian Treanor, a US academic, wrote that climbing can help us develop important qualities like courage and respect for nature. He thinks these qualities are important in today's world. Climbing can help us live better lives.

Some climbers believe that climbing without help from others or technology is more challenging and deserves more respect. Ebert and Robinson, two expert climbers, said that climbing alone or without extra help is harder and should be recognized more. But this idea can be dangerous because it might encourage risky behavior.

Climbing can also be about being in the moment and focusing on the climb. This is similar to Zen philosophy, which teaches people to find peace. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,"Text: 'For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel was very important in classical music. He was a serious man who played and recorded many famous European piano pieces. He wrote and played a lot, but he did not teach much. People who knew him well saw he could be fun, but he did not show this in his concerts. He worked hard, always studying, traveling, and performing. 

Then, four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not think it was a good idea. He had not taught many students before. He said, ‘You don’t need a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something special about Kit, who was about 14 years old then. Brendel listened to him play. Kit played very well and from memory. He gave Brendel a CD of a concert he did, and Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit’s performance was very special.

As Brendel is retiring, Kit is becoming more known. Brendel is careful because he does not want Kit to get tired too soon. Kit, now 19, is always busy. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, and plays tennis. His mother is always with him. Kit also writes music. Brendel says, ‘Writing music helps you read music better. Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. He listens to his own playing and to me when I teach him. He understands and can do what I say. If I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece.’

Brendel is careful not to make people expect too much from Kit. He says it is not good when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century. It can be harmful. Kit can play some things very well, but he needs more time and experience for others. 

Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says, ‘When I was young, I did not want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to do certain things by the age of 50. When I was 50, I did most of those things, but I wanted to do more, so I continued. I do not have the physical strength now, but in my mind, I think about many pieces I never played. I don’t play now, but it’s a nice new part of my life.’'"
20,"Text: 'When I was little, I thought gardens were always beautiful places. My Grandad's garden was not in a dirty city. It was next to a river and went down to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a place to escape and find peace. Grandad's garden was simple. He didn't have a greenhouse like some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old windows. At home, my dad was often quiet. He wasn't boring. He liked funny things and had favorite phrases like 'It's immaterial to me.' He left school without finishing and became a plumber. He didn't love plumbing; it was just his job. He wasn't very ambitious, but once he and Mum thought about moving to Canada. It didn't happen. He was good at fixing things at home. He could make bookshelves or cupboards very well. My parents moved house only once. But my mother liked to change furniture. One day, a piano came to our house. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother took them away. I never got to play the piano. My sister had lessons. When I asked my mother why I didn't, she said, 'You'd never have practised.' I liked the river best. I could imagine another world there. I would take a fishing net and go to the river. I wore old sandals and looked for fish. I tried to keep the fish at home, but it didn't work, so I put them back in the river. I wanted to leave school soon, but it seemed hard. One day, my father said, 'There is a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.' My dad usually wanted me to be a carpenter, but maybe he saw I loved gardening. I like to think he hoped it would be good for me.'"
21,"Text: 'Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. A strong wind from the Atlantic Ocean is blowing. It feels like it could push us off the cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen's sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and MacEwen pets him. The wind is loud, but MacEwen is comfortable on his island. He is showing me around. He points north and shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets more rain than we do.’ I see rain clouds over Rum's mountains. ‘Beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says, ‘I have sheep to move,’ as rain comes closer. We walk down the hill. As we walk, he tells me about the island: Muck is three km long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep stops our talk. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to move the sheep but is not doing well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen says, meaning the dog should go right. Tie goes straight into the sheep, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, sounding disappointed. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks sorry. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in summer. ‘They leave the house and come back when they’re hungry.’ But island life has challenges. Electricity is only available sometimes. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, Mary makes breakfast with a flashlight. I get used to it, along with no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary says. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then put the phone away.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck feels surprising. The boat today brings groceries and three musicians with instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with people tapping their feet to the music. That night, by a warm fire, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay from a newspaper ad. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know about farming? ‘She was good at typing.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, very tasty. Also uncertain: my ferry ride the next morning to another island. Many ferries were canceled in the last two months because of high seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. Now, with or without a phone, I secretly hope for that.'"
22,"Text: 'At first, the game design industry was mostly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It was not easy to enter. People often thought video games were just a hobby for young people. But now, the video games industry is serious business. Experts are not surprised. Making video games is hard. When a new movie comes out, video games about it need many team members and months of hard work. Like many jobs, it is hard to get into, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says: ‘It’s hard to make progress in big companies or to change big games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just the leaders, but also the people who design parts of the game.’ How can you join this industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim thinks differently. ‘The only way is to make games. The tools are there. You need to make something to get a job. Game design is more than a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, you must do it to make it real.’ Another expert, John Field, has other ideas. ‘Just doing it is good, but it’s more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs. Even fewer have the talent, skills, and vision to help the industry grow.’ Can you do it alone? ‘Maybe, but it’s hard,’ says John. ‘A good course in games can help and give support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and move up. They like all kinds of entertainment and arts. They may have worked a few years after school and decided games are for them. They are not just fans; they are interested in the future of games. Connections can help too. To get ahead, you need to network.’ The idea of a young boy playing games all day is old. Now, games are for everyone. Families play on consoles. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John thinks there is room to grow. ‘Games are for more people now. They are also a great way to learn. I see many new chances and opportunities.’"
23,"Text: 'Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy. He always told my friend what he couldn't do. My friend stopped playing football because of this. I am glad my dad was different. When I score a goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but it's not. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. The best players practice a lot, even if they have natural talent. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned technique. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning skills. At school, I played many sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know education is important, but football was all I thought about then. My teachers did a good job, but I didn't notice it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, but he is too young to sit still. He likes to kick the books around, like me. At the start of my football career, the manager helped young players like me join the first team. He didn't make a big deal about it, but we knew it was our chance. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize we had to work hard. I rely on my close friends and family. Having a lot of money can cause problems. People say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car. My family is strong and would not want to be on my payroll. My mum loves her job as a hairdresser. I like to use my money to help people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off. I want to go skiing, but I can't now because if I break a leg, I can't play football and won't be insured.'"
24,"Text: 'We were living at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He helped us find a cheap place to live because my father could not write in Los Angeles. Sam was worried about losing money. In the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point was not popular with visitors. The road was not good, and the nice resort of La Carmella was close by. People with money stayed there. Only people with little money or those who loved surfing came to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people came. After months alone, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy writing a script and was in a bad mood. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We did not have a dog when we moved to Reef Point, but Rusty chose us. I tried to chase him away, but he stayed. I gave him water, and my father pretended to be angry but was not serious. Rusty loved the beach and brought me things he found. Sometimes he brought things that were not his, like a new shoe or a towel, and I had to return them. Rusty liked to swim with me, even though I was faster. He never got tired. That day, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. One surfer was very good. She finished surfing and came over to me. She asked why I didn’t join them. I said I didn’t have a surfboard and no money to buy one. She asked if I was British and visiting. I said I lived here and my father came to write a film script. She asked his name, and I said Rufus Marsh. She knew his book, Tall as the Morning, and was interested in me after that.'"
25,"Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on the ship, Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late, but this was bad advice. There was a problem with the computer system, and everyone was upset. People had paid a lot of money for this trip, and now they were waiting for a long time. Violet wanted to leave, but she realized she lost her phone. This was more annoying than the long line. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left her phone there because all her numbers were in the phone. Her son Harry always told her to be careful about this. 

Violet asked a couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message, asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to look for her phone. If the phone was not in her apartment, she would have trouble because she needed the numbers in New York. Part of her was relieved, but she didn't tell Harry. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother. Her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding because he was forgetful too. 

Finally, the line started moving, and Violet gave her travel documents to go on the ship. She felt worse when she saw the ship's foyer. It looked like a hotel that tried too hard to be fancy. There were fake wood panels, shiny chandeliers, and carpets like those in airports. Violet went to the elevators, which were full of tired passengers. She was squished in the lift, but finally, she got out on the twelfth floor. Her room had the balcony she wanted. She was ready to complain if it didn't. She had paid a lot to make sure she could see the sea."
26,"Text: John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He did not know he was discovering the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer. Maloof now has many of Maier’s things: her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, 100,000 negatives, and many movies and audiotapes. Maloof feels lucky. He said, ‘When I bought this, I didn’t know what it was. I could have sold it all.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and grew up in France. She came back to New York in 1951 and moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Maier was private and always had a camera. She wore big coats, hats, and strong shoes. Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier, said, ‘On her day off, she had her camera and came back late at night. She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theatre and movies. She was not very social but liked to take pictures and talk to people. She loved her ‘second job’ of taking pictures. Rydzon said, ‘She was a true artist and did what she wanted.’ Maier’s work was not for money. Her photos often showed women, children, the old, and the poor. Photography expert Larry Silverman finds her pictures interesting. He wonders if she made her own style or copied others. Maloof wonders if he will see all the negatives. He did not care about photography before Maier’s work. Her pictures inspired him to take his own. Maloof said, ‘Her work is about people and street scenes. It is more important than I thought. We want to make her name known and put Vivian Maier in history books.’"
27,"Text: 'When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her book. The officer asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are many crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past gave more chances for problems for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I ask how it feels to be successful at a young age, she says, ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels the success is partly theirs. There’s a family feeling at home, and I got a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.’ Then she adds, ‘What is annoying is when people think I’m not trying to do something philosophical in the book.’ ‘I wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part is half the length of the one before,’ said Catton. It gets faster as it goes. I ask if it matters if the reader notices this. ‘I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them.’ Even with its unusual structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery. Surprisingly, she says she didn’t plan the story beforehand. ‘I would write myself into a corner and then see how I could get out of it.’ She also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We also talk about her love of TV drama series. I ask if she might like to write for TV. ‘That could be cool,’ she says. She talks with enthusiasm and laughs quietly. She is excited when talking about her work and New Zealand. ‘I notice when I come to Britain how my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to busy places, to be around many people.’ But for now, New Zealand will stay her home. I hope it gives her ideas for more novels.'"
28,"Text: 'When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. For the last forty years, he has been making guitars by hand. ‘I still love the guitar,’ he says. ‘It’s amazing how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound. Using different wood makes different sounds. It still surprises me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I wanted to make it myself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and wood types changed the sound.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny made, but he and his brothers had made other things before. ‘We made model boats and planes, so I knew how to build things. My father taught us to use tools. I also fixed instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar was good, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a job. ‘I also liked painting and sculpture,’ he says. After school, he studied architecture at university. ‘Architecture is about design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good job,’ he remembers. But he left the course halfway through. ‘I was too independent,’ he says. ‘But I realized I wanted to make guitars. It’s like sculpture because you shape sound. And it’s more practical than art because people use guitars.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. At first, he sold guitars for the cost of the materials, but as he became known as a good guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just making a living’. He can only make ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. In the early years, he worked hard to become known. He went to music festivals and asked musicians to try his guitars and tell their friends. He also learned how to price his guitars. Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the best guitars were from the USA,’ he says. ‘UK guitars weren’t seen as good, even though we have good courses and skills here. But now, UK hand-made guitars are respected.’ Jonny says you can learn important skills in classes, and new guitar-makers should take courses. But he also believes in learning by trying. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or thick, it won’t sound good. If someone teaches you, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’'"
29,"Text: 'When English people talk, they often start with the weather. This is a tradition. A famous writer, Dr Johnson, said, ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This was true 200 years ago and is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they are interested in it. But this is not true. The American writer Bill Bryson says the English weather is not exciting. There are no tornadoes or big storms. The English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman says the weather is interesting because it is always changing. My research shows that both are wrong. English people talk about the weather to start conversations. It is a way to be friendly. When someone says, ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’, they are not really talking about the weather. They are just starting a conversation. This is like monkeys grooming each other to be social. There are three times when English people use weather talk: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when there is nothing else to say. This makes it seem like English people talk about the weather a lot. But really, it is just a way to talk to each other.'"
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to tell her class of 12- and 13-year-olds about how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip over trips to Spain, Greece, or France. But they wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. She could not find a good historical novel about life at the Wall in Roman times, so she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started writing books in 2001. She said teaching is like acting and is very tiring, but writing is exciting and not as exhausting. Her old teaching friends are jealous because she still connects with children through her books. Alice wants her books to be different from other children's books, which are often about bad experiences or total fantasy like Harry Potter. She always taught English and History together and loves making bored children interested. Writing is like teaching for her. She started writing her first novel because there were not enough books like it, and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. She didn’t want to do it at first, but she had to send a story to join the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. The course students liked her story and said she should publish it. With only school report cards as proof of her writing, she asked for a year off to write her first book. Her husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and he helped her a lot. Alice says they work well together. He helps her improve her writing by changing sentences and suggesting new words. Alice likes to add more scenes to her stories."
31,"Text: 'To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. The race was between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same place. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. ‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and it’s very cold now, so I’ll be warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. He wore full winter cycling clothes, while Jonny wore jeans and a sweatshirt. Alistair said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’ The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and finished at Fleet Moss, Yorkshire’s highest road, 350 metres up. It was easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill at the start. After a quick handshake, they began. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss. Jonny got in the car and drove on the road. They would see each other again at the finish line. The question was, who would get there first? Jonny’s confidence dropped quickly. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he met a big tractor on the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he said to the cameraman in his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!’ After the tractor moved, Jonny continued driving. Alistair was having a hard time with the hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side, the ground was open, and the sun was shining. Alistair started to go faster. In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The roads in the villages were very narrow. He had to drive slowly and carefully. After the last village, the road was straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew where the other was. As Jonny drove fast to Fleet Moss, Alistair was riding across his last field and back on the road. He reached the finish line and stopped. Alistair looked up and asked the crowd, ‘Is he here?’ They said no. Alistair was happy. A few minutes later, Jonny arrived. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said sadly. ‘I’m disappointed.’'"
32,"Text: 'When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the silence is what you notice first. You bounce the ball on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the sound of your shot. The grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the quiet crowd make you feel like you are in a different world. The silence helps me focus on my game. During a match, I try to think only about the game and the point I am playing. When a point is over, the silence breaks with applause and cheers. I hear them, but they seem far away. I don’t think about the fifteen thousand people watching me in the arena or the millions watching on TV as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, always told me it was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I would play there and win. Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. Losing in 2006 was not so bad. I was happy to be there at age twenty. Federer beat me easily because I didn’t believe I could win. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have played better. It was not my skills that failed, but my mind. I cried for half an hour after that loss. Losing hurts more when you have a chance to win. Toni, who is a tough coach, usually criticizes me even when I win. But after that loss, he told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I told him he didn’t understand, that it was my last chance to win. I know a professional athlete’s career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I missed a big one in 2007. But Toni was right. I had another chance in 2008. I was sure I learned from my loss the year before. I believed I would win. The night before the final, I had dinner with family and friends. We didn’t talk about the match. They knew I was already thinking about it in my mind. Until the match started, that space in my mind was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: 'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in April 1957. She wrote to her family, ""I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa. She became a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist there. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made Jane Goodall famous with articles and TV shows about her work with chimpanzees. She also wrote books for children and adults, like the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which is in 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. Some people think her fame hides her real work. Many stories about her life are not complete. They show her as a girl who loved adventure, a woman who wanted to live with wild animals, and a feminist. But these stories do not show her true achievements. Jane Goodall's research is very important. She helped us understand chimpanzees' social and emotional lives. Before her work, people did not know chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We also did not know they have emotions and social systems like humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her study in Gombe, Nigeria, is called one of the great scientific achievements. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves. Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future. When she was five, she disappeared one day. The police and neighbors looked for her. She came back with straw in her hair. She had hidden in a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. This was the start of her career as a biologist.'"
34,"Text: 'During our first conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me in different voices. She sounds like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are known to people who watch children's TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to learn how to say many medical words.’ Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors think they can do funny voices, and many of them can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it. You have to make the script come alive for people who can’t see you. Many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions, but often they don’t get parts because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course to become a regular actor. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man at the recording studio asked me to try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and got a big part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I played the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often do voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers is complicated, which production companies want to avoid. Shirley has learned to make the right sounds and collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of a job that includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,’ she says. ‘The trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound happy. When I do animation work, it feels like a holiday; working with other actors makes a big difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is important. ‘It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that help voiceover artists make them.’ She says she got where she is – near the top of her job – through hard work as much as talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practising your voices, it’s about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley suggests attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes loving human sound is important, describing herself as obsessed with voices and becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been doing a certain kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll speak like that for hours, maybe even days,’ she says. ‘My children are used to their mum talking in different voices.’'"
35,"Text: 'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people stop dreaming about these jobs and think about more realistic ones, like being a lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can make money by drawing doodles like the ones in school notebooks seems silly. But some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school papers, and was known as ‘the kid who draws’. I studied graphic design in college and showed my drawings to different companies after I graduated. I was lucky to find a newspaper that needed political cartoons. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to live on. You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be very good at drawing. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. Being a cartoonist is hard. You shouldn’t try it unless you feel you can’t do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and gives you time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t say no to any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about everything. What about the business side of being a cartoonist? In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs at newspapers and magazines. But now, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to make and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than those who are very artistic but not good at business. I often meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they don’t let others see their work! To protect your work, just draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright’, put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it’s not a disaster – it can be a lucky break!'"
36,"Text: 'Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually don't like to throw things away, so why did I want to throw this guitar away? I took it to the rubbish dump. A young man saw me and asked, ‘You’re not going to throw that away, are you?’ I said yes, and he asked if he could have it. I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways. After that, I felt sad about what I did. A few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. It was from a man named Keith Rushton, who fixes guitars. He said, ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’ The guitar had been sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found my name and address on the back of the guitar. He used my name to find me online and contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He wanted to sell it back to me. I was so happy. I would have paid him anything, but his price was fair. My dad used to put name-and-address stickers on everything, even my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s because it was popular. I liked the sound, but I couldn’t learn well. So, I switched to the electric guitar. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn’t have to play well to be a rock star. When I got my guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. The guitar felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I played it again, and my fingers remembered the chords. The electric guitar is not really for playing alone. Now, I want to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people like me and we can call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!'"
37,"Text: 'People are talking a lot about sleep these days. When I wrote the book Insomniac, about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was the only one saying how bad it is not to sleep. Not sleeping affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who can't sleep know how important sleep is. It's good that sleep is getting attention now. But what about dreams? I don't hear much about dreams. We lose dreams when we wake up early. The last hour or two of sleep is when we dream the most. This is called REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen in REM sleep, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM. When people don't get REM sleep, they have more REM the next night. This shows dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM sleep. Many agreed with Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, who said dreams help us understand our minds. But later studies did not support this. Now, dream studies focus more on the physical side of dreams. There is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study. It showed that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams better than other people. He thinks people who are interested in creativity use dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with dreams because films are like dreams. But I wonder, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Stickgold says dreams help us think in new ways. They help us find new patterns and ideas. For example, when people wake up from REM sleep and are asked to say what they think of a word, their answers are more original. They put together ideas in surprising ways. This is creativity, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a bad dream helps me think. On those days, words and ideas come quickly. I don't know why, but it works. Creativity is not just for writers or artists. We all live in a complex world. We need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively in our relationships with others. This is why we need to dream.'"
38,"Text: 'Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London and moved to a small town by the sea in south-west England. In her studio, you can see the sea from the window. There are empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a famous copyist artist. She can paint like famous artists from the past, like Monet and Van Gogh. Her copies look so real that even art experts think they are the originals. The real paintings are worth millions, but Susie’s copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on how long she works on them. Susie’s clients include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors like to show off her copies as if they are real. One famous person says he has a ‘Van Gogh’ painting, but it is really a ‘Susie Ray Van Gogh’. Some people keep the real painting in a bank and hang Susie’s copy at home. Susie is honest about her work. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as the real thing, and Susie does not do that. She knows people who have, but they often get into trouble. Susie was not always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She did not earn much money, but it helped her learn to be accurate. Now, she tells young artists to learn to draw well. Susie has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants, make copies of old paintings, and reproduce modern art. She likes French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie says it is not. The impressionists painted quickly but carefully, and that is hard to do. Susie does not paint her own original art. She says her work is the result of years of training, and she earns a good living from it. She tried painting her own things once, like fishing nets, but they looked like photos. Susie is a perfectionist.'"
39,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and wanted to be the fastest sailor. From a young age, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a strong connection with her boats, and they worked together as one. When she was on land, she found everyday life boring and wanted to return to the ocean. After coming second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her small boat, Kingfisher. It was her home for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. She showed me her freeze-dried food, small gas stove, and medical supplies. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat. She thinks it is small and beautiful, but its supplies are running out. Her view changed after a trip to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. There, she helped with a bird survey and saw many old whaling stations. This made her think about how we take what we want and move on. When I visited Ellen’s office, she explained why we must act now to save the planet. She said, ""No one is making coal, oil, or gas anymore. We have to find a way not to use them up."" She now talks about re-using things, like industrial carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories and talked to people about using fewer non-renewable resources. She started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a sustainable future.

Ellen misses the adventure of being at sea. She says it made her who she is. At sea, she was focused on the record and survival. Her new message is not as simple as being the fastest sailor, but it is more important. She believes this work is the most important thing she has ever done."
40,"Text: 'Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he could become very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and games, but Jordan wants to inspire kids to go outside. Jordan's team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero'. Climbing Everest is only part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he turns 20. Some famous climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say a young climber might be strong, but they worry if a teenager is emotionally ready. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing. The Romeros know about these opinions. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't worry about it. We have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.' I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father loves adventure? Paul says, 'This is not about me becoming famous for my son's achievements. At first, Jordan wanted to do it later, but we thought: 'Why not now?' We talk to him to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he likes about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on my goal.' In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record challenge. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This is a problem for Jordan. We might say that achievement is more important than enjoyment, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to share his story. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He has to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. 'And you know what?' Paul says. 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.''"
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s probably not classical music they’re listening to. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they don’t know who he is. I am studying music at university, but my classmates don’t know much about classical music either. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t have their recordings. The numbers are not good for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical CD sells only 300 copies. I find that hard to believe. Why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who buy most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I’m not a big classical music fan. I like many styles, but I don’t listen to much classical music. So why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Experts say we can’t pay attention for more than about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more interesting to teenagers than long classical pieces with no words. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When did you last hear classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people go to classical concerts now, but I bet not many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don’t know why more people like classical concerts when they are older, but if you’re a teenager and your parents like something, you probably won’t. Some say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids want to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They like classical music when they play it, but it’s not their favorite music. When we relax, we listen to pop music.'"

Her mother was getting out of the car too, but she didn’t hear Bonnie. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre. ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do so. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be in trouble soon anyway,"" she thought, ""so why not start now?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre. There was an old building for the horses and a large place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She was careful as she went to the horses. Bonnie respected horses. The horses were well cared for, she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best!"" she said. He was brown with some white. He looked lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" said Bonnie, petting his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you in a big competition."" His name was Maverick. She wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,"" she thought. The room with the riding equipment was unlocked. Bonnie was happy. She put a saddle on Maverick and forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said. ""I know about horses, even if I don’t know about other things."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and the breeze felt good on her face. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he’d jump well."

44,"Text: 'I jumped out of bed, moved the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I looked at the sandbags that protect the buildings from flooding when the ice melts. My back still hurt from lifting them. Last week, I worked with many people from the town for long hours. I wanted to show I could do it. But my grandfather didn’t notice much. I looked at the black water from the factory in Milltown. There was ice on both sides, and then solid ice downstream. I took off my pyjamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit. I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. He was trying to walk on the ice near the warm water from the factory. I put on my kayaking jacket and checked the pocket for my lucky chain. My famous grandfather brought it from South America. Only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I touched the chain and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled as I took a banana. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hall and almost bumped into Grandpa. ‘Watch where you’re going,’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ My wetsuit should have made it clear. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath. He went to the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom came with a smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I said. I didn’t say he’s always like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me photos of him in National Geographic. Those photos are still on his wall, above his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now, and maybe one day, my face in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay close to him. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back and peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my trip.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I went to the backyard and hurried to the boathouse.'"
45,"Text: Mum took Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, there was a painting. It was one of Grandpa's, but it looked different and was not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in it, but she didn't know the river. Maybe it was not a real river, just a fantasy one. The picture was strange and beautiful. There were no animals, birds, or people. It felt right that way. Jess thought about autumn coming after summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, like she was hiding her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others understand them. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa wrote. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn’t it? Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess what he said."" Jess knew what Grandpa would say. ""He said it's not the artist's job to explain a painting. Each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without explaining it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""Yes, every ignoramus. If artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they’d never finish their work. And he said …"" Mum laughed and interrupted. ""Something like that. I hoped you might know something about this painting because you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" ""Someone who gives an artist ideas."" Jess knew the word. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint. He would say the muse wasn't kind to him or he needed to be nice to the muse. She thought he meant a goddess, not a person. It was hard to think anyone could influence Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"Text: 'This morning, I did not plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I am not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet. I am not saying this happened, just that it could have. I did not wake up thinking, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. I am unlucky that way. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small, white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran kept china ornaments in it. I keep shells, fossils, and stones there. I always loved Gran’s cabinet. I was excited when she gave it to me! But it is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It must stand in a corner. I have only two corners in my bedroom. My room is the smallest in the house, under the roof, and shaped like a wedge of cheese. Mum and Dad have the big front bedroom; my sister Angela has the back one; my brother Tom has the one over the garage; and I have the smallest one. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But Angela is only fifteen, so I will be in my small room for years. I do not mind; I like my little room. It is cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a little too tall. If I could cut a few centimetres off the bottom... Then I had an idea. If I could not cut the cabinet, maybe I could cut a hole in the carpet. It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box’. That is what I was doing!'"
47,"Text: 'The novel ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of very small people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly take things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV show of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' view, not a human one, which made filming more difficult. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed the Borrowers walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres to get the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when the tiny Borrowers were combined with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called and asked how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully strange. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh. But in the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off because it was sewn on every morning. The lead actor’s trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was very hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for the costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t very accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realising there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was successful in showing the magic of the books.'"
48,"Text: Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously for journalists, but there are none. I wonder how long it will be before the craziness starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be friends, the ones who ask for free tickets to my dad’s concerts. ""Everything’s going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone with this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life on the road and with tutors. While the band is here for recording, we are staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so normal. I walk into the school’s main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I tell the school secretary. ""Name?"" she asks, not very friendly. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. She seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That’s good. Few people know my last name because my dad uses his stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it’s printing,"" she says. Then she gives me the paper. English Literature, first period. Cool, I like English. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map last night, so I don’t look lost. When I get to the door, the teacher is already calling names. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" I slip in quietly and sit in the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. She looks at my outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look at my expensive shoes with flowers. Oh no, I shouldn’t have worn these. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and says her name is Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them, she lets us talk! All teachers should do this. ""So why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many choices. Do I say I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else pick a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well, everyone will find out soon. But I’ll have some time to be normal until then. ""He’s an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way."" And she doesn’t care. Excellent."

People think that if you do not try hard, you are lazy. Teenagers have a lot of pressure. They have homework, tests, activities after school, jobs, chores at home, and they also try to have a social life. Kristen Loose, a teenager, says that people forget how much pressure teenagers have. Even with all this stress, people still think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, and only care about themselves. Kristen says this is not true. She uses her phone a lot, but not just for fun. It helps her with her life and school. Teenagers today need to be connected all the time. They use smartphones and tablets to do homework anywhere. Schoolwork and activities need attention all the time, not just at school. Many teenagers start their day at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do this every day with less than nine hours of sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only 20% of teens get nine hours of sleep. Also, 28% of teens fall asleep in school once a week because they are tired. Lindamarie Olsen, another teenager, says she has about 18 hours of free time a week. This is not much out of 168 hours in a week. She does not waste this time on social media or TV. She likes to volunteer. Olsen says people think teenagers only care about themselves, but she loves helping others. Her favorite time of the week is when she volunteers. In the future, teenagers will still prove people wrong and make the world better. There will be new students who will change the world before they finish school.'"
50,"Text: 'The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the last few years, this group has sent more than fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a science project that is also an adventure, which is why teenagers like it. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, making a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, given by a fan from a nearby state, is used to fill the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy drove seven hours to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time to let the balloon go. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they say, and the balloon goes up. Some of them run and follow it with flashlights until they can't see it anymore. There is quiet and a feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the clear sky. It’s hard to believe they are just four hours from Los Angeles, a big city with about 4 million people. I see a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops and the balloon gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in the middle of nowhere. ‘To me, finding the lunch box is a big part of the program,’ says the group’s leader. They have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘We learn about the land in a way you never would.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then up the other side. They had to decide if driving or walking was better. It could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘These students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to them.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It’s a bit disappointing, but it’s a chance to talk about atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. And it’s another adventure story to share.'"

Her younger brother loved dinosaurs, which is common for kids, but Chloe didn't. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries. It amazed her, and she knew she wanted to study Palaeontology. I asked her if anyone encouraged her because Palaeontology was not a common job for young people then. She remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius. He was famous and young. Chloe was nervous to meet him, even though he was friendly. She worried he would think she was just a kid asking too many questions. But he was patient and listened to her. I asked Chloe about palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. She thinks movies like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs but not always in Palaeontology. She says movies show palaeontologists as strange geniuses or nerds who can't talk to people. They don't show what palaeontologists really do every day. Chloe's job is different every day. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, studies fossils, and writes for science magazines. She also talks to the public about science when she can. She thinks it's important to explain science to people, especially young people. Talking about dinosaurs can make kids excited about science and help them learn more. Chloe helped with a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She says the show makers knew a lot, and she only gave advice if needed. She checked that the dinosaurs shown lived at the same time. The show was popular with all ages because it showed dinosaurs in a new way. Chloe thinks dinosaurs are interesting because they make us want to explore and discover new things. They remind us there is still more to learn about the world. Palaeontology is like time travel.'"
52,"Text: ""I will say this once: when you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not 'there yet,' even if you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' When you arrive, it is not 'there' anymore; it is 'here.' So, if you think you are 'there,' you should ask 'Are we here yet?' Parents want to be 'there' more than kids do because they hear this question many times during long car trips. Kids should not complain. They can relax in the back seat, watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the scenery passes by outside. In the front seat, mum or dad gives out juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio, and keeps everything running smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. But sometimes, someone in the car does something annoying, like my younger brother, Tim. He might put his foot on my side of the seat. I put my foot on his side, and soon we are fighting. Mum or dad separates us and tells Tim to stay in his seat. This calms things down for a while. The scenery continues to pass by. Later, I try to read, but I feel a breeze on my arm. Tim is blowing on me from his seat. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is not doing anything wrong. I get angry, and Tim gets in trouble again. Then things calm down. Dad has ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask 'Are we there yet?' he sometimes says, 'Yes, we are here. Get out of the car.' We say, 'But Dad, we are still on the highway.' He replies, 'Oh, maybe we are not there yet.' This makes us quiet for a while. You know you are 'there' when the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids. So remember: if mum and dad can still answer your question, then the answer is: no, you are not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi hope people will enjoy this and come back again. Zuzi says they started the café because people are always on their phones and gadgets. They want people to talk and have fun together without screens.

The games in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have simple themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources. Everyone stays involved until the end, and no one feels left out. Later, 'co-operative' games were made where everyone wins or loses together. This makes people talk and work together more. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players solve global problems together. Leacock was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings.

Leacock loved board games since he was a child, even though he sometimes found them disappointing. With his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular. The new version of Pandemic has a lot of storytelling. It is like a video game because you can develop characters and change the game world.

Video games have helped board games become popular. Many people play games on their phones now. Ben Hogg, who works for a games company, says more people are open to playing games. Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many video games are played online, and players are not in the same place. Some people miss playing games with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun. In our online world, people like to share games in real life, and this trend will continue."
54,"Text: 'Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK songs in recent years. His story shows why hard work and not giving up are important in the music business, even if your career starts slowly. His mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. At home, he only listened to a local radio station for older people, which influenced him as he grew up. He was 12 when he first heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he did at a national level, and music. He spent his school lunchtimes playing the piano. He says, ‘I was good at tennis, but I didn’t want to do it forever. It was too much work.’ At 17, he left school to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to write songs and play music. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he signed with a music publisher at 19 because of one song. But record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he left the duo. He became famous working behind the scenes, not on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he moved to another label to release a new album, but he didn’t become famous. He says, ‘In my own artist career, I was often in the wrong place at the wrong time. But as a writer, I was in the right place at the right time.’ Writing for others is where he succeeded. He says, ‘I think I am one of the main writers in the UK that labels send new artists to.’ He helps start their careers. Sometimes he tells artists that writing songs for the charts is okay. ‘Why not? Don’t you want 10 million people to listen to your music next month? We should write something amazing that will also sell well.’ It is nice to hear someone talk honestly about wanting to write big hit songs. Jamie is not arrogant; he just knows he wants to write number one songs and is good at it. He focuses on writing the best music. ‘When I go into the studio, we need to aim for global success and write the best music of next year. It’s not just about being cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.’'"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of famous person. He is very popular online, but people who do not watch online videos might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist'. He jumps from one place to another, like from a roof to a wall, on his bike. These jumps are filmed and put online. 

I met Tony in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many local boys and older people knew him and called him 'an absolute legend'. After watching him, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and imagination. Before each jump, Tony explained what he wanted to do. I did not always believe he could do it, but he did. When I praised him, he did not seem very happy. Even though he is famous online, Tony does not like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans and prefers doing things instead of talking about them.

Tony's fame comes from social media and new camera technology. This technology helps him make a living. He says many people are always looking at screens, and he does not always like that. But he is not complaining. His videos help him earn money from what used to be just a hobby.

I have learned that to become a top athlete, you need energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent. In risky sports, you need mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times but kept trying until he succeeded.

Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people do not understand his sport. They do not know he gets advice from experts to stay safe. Tony is careful about risks. He says some people never get scared, but he does. He finds a way to overcome fear. He is not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning. Before a new jump, he prepares his mind. He knows he must be confident before he jumps. If he is fully committed, he is okay."

For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she knew some circus skills, she found high-wire walking very different. ‘The training was a surprise’, said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then an hour of exercises, with another hour after my day on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall on the wire so I could continue if I slipped. Every time I fell, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterwards. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ But Helen is still planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"

Jeff had already written a book about traveling around Canada in a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go to Amsterdam for a holiday. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a normal bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 because of a knee injury, he finally started his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which I couldn’t do, but I never regretted my penny farthing. The further from home I got, the more amazed people were by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in bed for ten days without medicine. He had no money for hospital bills or to go home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would travel again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’'"

I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I test and taste products. I give samples to my colleagues, and they are happy! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients. It’s nice to have a private space to go to during the day. Every day is different in this job. Sometimes I am at our food lab, and other times I travel to buy raw materials. I have a young family, so traveling can be hard. But I love the variety and the lack of routine in my job.

60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience - a place where young people learn circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents come to some classes to see how they are doing. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to do different things – it’s important to keep performances exciting. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get hurt, or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is planning for the future because you can only travel while you’re young and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many past students start businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a job for making money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!”'"

I’ll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very hard because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared: I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.’ ‘One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don’t always know which musical range is best for the female voice.

She did not choose her first idea. When she decided on satchels, not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, 'Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.' She worked with her family from the start, especially her mother, who had never had a career but was good at business. The design came from children's storybooks. Julie did not know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To get interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest grew, as did the speed her company made the satchels. Julie now loves seeing which celebrity has a satchel! While other companies spend money on online ads, she uses the internet community for new style ideas, keeping her products fresh. There was a hard time when another company copied Julie's design to sell similar bags. Now, she makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors say the offices have a positive feeling – people love working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it is the team that makes it special.'"

The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days.

We often stopped to explore rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish. I did not know many of them. It was nice not to worry about time. We always made lunch and dinner together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it was relaxing! When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I also wanted to tell everyone at home about our adventures!'"

I saw my city in a new way, like the tourists did. After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide.

After some hard but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide. Tour guiding is not just about knowing facts or keeping the group together. You need other skills too. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organised tour. I must make sure visitors are happy, or they might write a bad review online. Good reviews bring more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is important. I put a lot of energy into my job, so my reviews are usually very good, and people often recommend my tours to other visitors in Chicago.'"
68,"My name is Ella and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. But in the end, we did not need to worry. 

One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their food. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun doing this, even if I got wetter than the elephants!

In the evening, we took the elephants into the forest where they stayed at night. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so it was small. We chose to share because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we knew it would be like that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we liked. After dinner, we talked and played games with the other volunteers and staff.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I am not sure she is telling the truth. I think she might be a bit upset because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy her time there fully. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go. Maybe she will go back one day – I know I will!"

Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and put flowers in vases. Then we make flower bunches and decide how much they cost. Customers are often surprised by the price, and I sometimes ask them to choose again. Some people think this is too much work, but I like making nice flower bunches for the money people want to spend. I love my job and wouldn’t want any other!'"
70,"Text: 'My city has a modern cinema that shows all the new films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It is very close to where I live. But a year ago, I felt something was missing – talking about a film with people after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, and this made the film feel real, which was great! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own equipment. We also know how many tickets we sell because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages say they had a great time, it feels wonderful. The website helps us a lot, and we now talk to other film clubs in the country. We have visited them to see how they do things, but it is always nice to come back to our own club! We started a blog because most people look online for film information now, not in local newspapers. We also put up some posters in cafés. But nothing works as well as people telling their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we do with each film – last month we had a movie quiz, and everyone enjoyed it.'"
71,"Text: 'When I was a child, I loved taking photos. At 15, I wanted to make my hobby more serious. So, I started a project: I would take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking photos of many things. Then, someone said my project would be better if all my photos had a common theme. I agreed and started taking photos of nature, like birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different because other young photographers took color photos. Sometimes, I doubted my project and almost stopped. But I trusted myself and became more confident. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered my photos for fun. I will never forget when the judges said I won first prize. I was so happy because my project was important to me. It was the first time I thought my photography was good, and maybe I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio and I am happy with my career choice.'"
72,"Text: 'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were new things for me. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ help you. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I made good relationships with the children. Now I go there for about four hours a week and I really look forward to it.

Because of what I learned at the children’s club, I decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a youth worker – someone who works with children. I never thought about this before starting at the club. I had never thought about my future job, and the idea of youth work was new to me. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!'"
73,"Text: 'I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort, two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and had not thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. After this, I loved the sport and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people do many competitions and get bored, but I still love competing and winning. This helps me try harder. I like not having a fixed plan. Sometimes this works well, like when I got a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I was not sure I would try the jumps that gave me this score until I started. This made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I do not have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend time with my friends. This helps me when I cannot snowboard. I think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I want something else to do if I do not become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I wonder if I can become a doctor if I have time for college. I cannot imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I cannot snowboard my whole life.'"
74,"Text: 'When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a lot from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't like it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it was hard, but it was easier than I expected. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they liked them, but I thought they were just being nice. I wanted to know if other people would like them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists come to my town, and they bought my jewellery as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum at a market stall! That was when I knew it could work, and I decided to make a website. Since then, I have made a lot of money with my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It has been a lot of fun.'"
75,"Text: 'When Janine Stuart was only 13, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. This book became very popular. Being Amelia is a little bit about Janine’s life. In an interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, who goes to a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially with her older brother. I am my parents’ only child, so I used my imagination to write that.’ Janine started her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers always told her to write, so it seemed like a good way for Janine to spend her time. The year before, she entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they wanted to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story have some hard times, and this makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that even though Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a very long book, she is a better writer than some other popular authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ‘At first, I hid when people knew me in the street, but now it’s OK. I’d like to give advice to other young writers, but they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!’'"
76,"Text: 'I’m Tom. I’m fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father got a job as the castle’s manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and lets people visit them. He was happy because he thought he wouldn’t get another chance like this. But it took some time for us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were thinking about what life on the island would be like. We knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our nice home across the water, and there was no school. After we moved, we got used to living on the island. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. In summer, the island is busy because many people visit, and there are often parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live here, and there aren’t many teenagers, which I hoped for. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which is hard work. The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I was excited to go on stormy days with big waves, but the ferries don’t run then! If I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is a problem. So when friends come home with me, I tell them to hurry up! But we often see amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it’s so foggy you can’t see anything, then it’s sunny again in a few hours – it’s still amazing to me. We do have bad storms, and I sometimes worry if the castle is strong enough. But then I remember it’s been here for hundreds of years – and it’s still standing!'"
77,"Text: 'I live in a house in the beautiful countryside in Scotland. I love nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural home. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They showed me how to tell the difference between bird types and where to find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we came home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird types. I am close to reaching my goal because on family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I’d see my 200th bird there. I wasn’t too sad when it didn’t happen, because I’ve learned you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge. Many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fun hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I wasn’t nervous until just before I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over. The teachers said I’d prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money.'"
78,"Text: 'I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. My family knew I often liked new hobbies and then stopped them, so they thought I would do the same with football. But I didn’t stop. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. The chance came sooner than I thought. I often played in local games, and one of the referees saw that I was a good player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I didn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13 years old. After that, I got much better. Still, some people didn’t think I would be a star player, which made me a bit sad. But the coach told me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s important matches, much earlier than I thought! I ran very hard – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by luck, I scored the winning goal. Even with the big crowd, I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, the team carried me around the field. It was fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to let them talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to think they could play for a top team if they work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few bad times, though – so I’ve been lucky!'"
79,"Text: 'In the UK and other countries, schools and universities are now encouraging students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research skills are useful in school and at work. As a student, you help create knowledge. You do this by asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? These questions are part of research. Research can be very complex or it can be simple, like asking questions about everyday things. Most students have done some research before, like for school projects or at work. You also do research when you plan a holiday, grow plants, fix things, train a pet, or shop online. In college, you need to ask questions, explore information, and create your own ideas. Some students find this hard because in some places, knowledge is seen as something you get from teachers and books. But in the UK, US, and other places, you are expected to question what you learn. This can be challenging. Critical thinking is important in research. We need to think about what we read and hear, and not just accept it as true. We should check if the information is logical and supported by evidence. We should not just believe everything we are told.'"
80,"Text: 'Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafés. But living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso moved to the countryside later. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains. They found that city life can make us tired and less able to think clearly. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients get better faster when they can see trees. Even a small view of nature helps our brains because it gives us a break from city life. More people now live in cities than ever before. We live in crowded places with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a busy city street, our brain has to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and noise. This is tiring because our brain has to decide what to focus on. Nature, on the other hand, is relaxing and doesn't need much effort from our brain. This idea is called attention restoration theory. Psychologist Stephen Kaplan says that being in nature helps our brain relax and recover. Parks in cities, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A walk in a park can help our brain work better. People try many things to improve their thinking, like energy drinks or changing office designs, but being in nature is very effective. So, why do cities keep growing? Even with the internet, cities are still places of new ideas. Research shows that the busy and crowded parts of cities help people be creative. Just like 18th-century London, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of new ideas. The challenge is to keep the good parts of city life while reducing the stress. Sometimes, people want to leave the city and enjoy nature, but they also love the excitement of city life.'"
81,"Text: 'Where is the mind? This might seem like a strange question. We usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have special machines that can show this. But I believe the study of the mind should not stop at the head. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, that things outside our heads also help us think. For example, in archaeology, we see that stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems have helped humans think and grow. So, maybe what is outside the head is also part of the mind. 

We often think the mind and brain are the same because scientists study people without the things around them. This is because brain machines need it this way. But much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I do not question that the brain is important for thinking, but I think the mind is more than just the brain. Human intelligence might spread into culture and the world around us. This is where my new idea, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how things become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how this has changed over time and what it means for our thinking.

Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The stick and the person work together, showing how our minds and things are connected. The stick helps the blind person feel the world, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. This shows that human intelligence can change by using new tools. My idea sees the human mind as always changing and growing. 

It is important to remember that, in history, the 'stick' could be anything from old stone tools to the internet. The main job of the 'stick' is to help us understand the world, not to limit us. Humans use 'sticks' to learn and know more. This is why humans make things, and these things help shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds change as they interact with the world. MET helps us understand how different tools, from old axes to smartphones, change who we are and how we think. Technology that changes the mind sounds like science fiction, but humans have used it since they first appeared.'"
82,"Text: 'Photography is an invention that has changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became important in many areas, like science, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians say photography is one of the US's biggest contributions to art. To understand its impact, we need to look at its start in the mid-19th century. Why did people like this new art? First, photography was a mechanical process, which matched the US's love for technology and change. Like trains and electricity, photography made the world feel smaller by showing us new places and things. Second, people used cameras to show their identity and family. Photos gave families a way to keep memories, even if they were a bit idealized. Third, photos were realistic and matched the US's love for realism in art. A photo shows what the photographer wants us to see, saying, ""Look at this!"" Photos are records of events, people, and things, showing what was in front of the camera. But, because a person takes the photo, it also shows their point of view. We might think we understand a photo because we know the subject, but its meaning can be complex. A photo's meaning can change depending on where and how we see it, like in a newspaper or a gallery. To understand a photo, we need to know why it was taken and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things in different places and times. Artists now use photos in their work. Since Andy Warhol, artists have included photos in paintings and other art forms. Photography is now an important part of art, working together with painting.'"
83,"Text: 'In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, called psychology the 'science of mental life.' This is still a good way to start understanding psychology today. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we have some idea of what mental life means. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is mostly about humans. James thought human psychology had basic parts: thoughts and feelings, the world around us, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is personal and comes from our own thoughts and experiences. Sometimes, we think we know why people act a certain way, like feeling unhappy or quitting a job. But people can see things differently. Psychology tries to find out which explanations are correct. Psychologists help us see the difference between our own ideas and scientific facts. They study the mind and brain, but they do not know everything about how the brain works. Instead, they learn by watching how people behave. Psychology is like solving a puzzle. It uses clues from careful observation and logical thinking. Psychology wants to describe, understand, predict, and change things it studies. It helps in many areas, like teaching children to read or helping people with their feelings. Psychology has been studied scientifically for about 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at their own thoughts, but this has limits. Today, psychologists prefer to study the behavior of others.'"
84,"Text: 'In a simple building in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. For example, there is A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola. These products were taken off the market because they did not sell well. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and Carol Sherry is in charge of it. She thinks each product has a sad story for the people who made and sold it. The museum is a business that makes money, which is surprising. Many companies do not keep their failed products, so they come to this museum to see them. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who worked in marketing, wanted to collect all kinds of products, not just the ones that failed. He started doing this in the 1960s. He found out that most products do not succeed. This is why the museum has so many failed products. People often think positively and do not see when a product will fail. Sometimes, marketers spend more money on a product that is not selling to try to make it work. People do not like to talk about why a product failed. In the self-help world, people believe that thinking positively can make good things happen. But psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that thinking too much about success can make people less motivated. Carol Dweck, another psychologist, says that how we see failure depends on what we believe about ability. Some people think ability is natural, while others think it can grow with effort. People who believe in natural ability find failure very hard. But people who believe in growing ability see failure as a chance to learn and get better. This way of thinking is happier, even if it does not always lead to success.'"
85,"Text: 'Many people know that sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is this? We might think we know, but sports are changing a lot. Two things make us question why home advantage is important: science and money. Sports scientists study how players perform best and have many ideas about home advantage. Business people wonder if home advantage matters if players are paid well. 

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in another country? British fans think their team needs their support. Fans often believe that when they cheer, their team scores. But they forget the times when cheering did not lead to a goal. 

One thing that seems true is that home fans can affect the referee. In an experiment, referees watched a game with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows that referees might avoid making calls that upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not by much. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won 70% of the time, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be hard, but now players travel in comfort. Stadiums are also more similar now. 

Home advantage is different in each sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball needs teamwork. Playing at home might boost team confidence.

Another reason for home advantage could be players' feelings. Before home games, players have higher testosterone levels, which might make them more aggressive. This was seen in the Rugby World Cup, where home teams won against stronger teams. As one referee said, ‘It’s the law of the jungle out there.’'"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said the golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports. Many athletes and coaches like it. The saying means: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate. This debate asks if talent is something you are born with or something you learn. Many people think practice is more important than talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said you need 10,000 hours of practice to be an expert. This idea is in books like Outliers and Talent Is Overrated. These books say practice is the most important thing. But, in his book, Epstein says this is not always true. He looks at why some people are very good at what they do. He travels to places like Kenya and Sweden to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that sled dogs’ success might be because of their genes. This suggests that drive and determination might also be genetic. Epstein talks about nature (genes) and nurture (practice). He says both are important for top athletes. He thinks if Usain Bolt grew up in the US, he might have been a basketball player. Epstein also talks about race and gender. He asks why men and women compete separately if only practice matters. Sometimes, the best questions are the simplest ones."""
87,"Text: 'A recent report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks: why are children today so unhappy? In her book, Kith, Griffiths says it is because children stay inside too much, watching TV or using computers, and they do not spend time in nature. She thinks this is the main problem. A study talked to children and found that many would be happier if they could play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their childhood as free and fun, playing outside all day. They think this was better and healthier than how children live now. But these adults are the ones who keep their children inside because they worry about safety. Griffiths talks about how parents' fear helps toy and gadget companies sell more products. She also writes about how some children are given medicine for being restless or have to wear goggles for playground games. Griffiths is upset about these things and writes passionately about them. However, she sometimes goes too far in her ideas. She thinks children should have freedom to explore and take risks. She says children need small accidents to learn how to avoid big ones. But she does not explain how to make sure accidents are small. Also, not all children want to explore. Some are shy and like to stay home. Maybe the real problem is making all children do the same thing, whether staying inside or going outside.'"
88,"Text: 'I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of school. Most problems in life cannot be solved with formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgement, wisdom, and creativity from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My research is about how play helps children grow. All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that have more to learn play more. For example, animals that hunt play more than those that eat plants. Primates, like monkeys, play more than other animals because they need to learn more. Children play the most because they have the most to learn. Play is how children learn important skills for life. These skills cannot be taught in school. They are learned through play. These skills include thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling emotions. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can solve new problems and ask new questions. Creative people think playfully. Geniuses keep this playful thinking. Albert Einstein said school almost made him lose interest in math and physics, but he found it again after school. He called his work ‘combinatorial play’. He imagined chasing a sunbeam to develop his ideas. We cannot teach creativity, but school can stop it by focusing on one right answer. More important than creativity is getting along with others and working together. Children are born wanting to play with others. Through play, they learn social skills and fairness. Play is voluntary, meaning players can stop anytime. To keep playing, they must make others happy. This makes play democratic. School has become harder: less break time, more homework, and more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised play. Adults now feel they must solve children's problems. These changes have happened slowly but are big. They are due to parents' fears, experts' warnings, less community, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children need more play, not more school. We must let children play and explore to grow into strong adults for the future.'"
89,"Text: 'In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them talk directly to employers. In the past, people had to stand outside offices with signs saying 'hire me' to get noticed. But using social media can also lead to mistakes. For example, a young person in the US asked a marketing executive on LinkedIn to share her contacts. She was upset because she worked hard to build her contacts and did not want to share them with a stranger. She sent a harsh reply, which many people saw online. This story shows that young people need to be careful when using social media for work. Social media can be dangerous if you do not know how to use it correctly. Many young people make mistakes because they use social media for fun, like on Facebook and Twitter, where they can be bold and confident. But using social media for work is different. Employers often say young people seem too familiar and arrogant on professional sites. This can make it hard for them to get jobs, even if they have the right skills. So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, say who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research. This way, you have a better chance of getting a good reply. Do not send the same message to everyone, and be polite. Social media can help you make good contacts, but you need to use it carefully.'"
90,"Text: 'It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Some people think newspapers will disappear. Since 2000, many UK newspapers have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people say that in 15 years, there will be no more printed newspapers. But old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here. Theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and TV. Radio is still popular even with TV, and cinema is still here despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again, with sales up a lot since 2008. Newspapers were once new too. They became popular in the 19th century because of the steam press, railway, and telegraph. People started to want news regularly. In medieval times, people did not expect change. They only noticed the seasons and big events like famine or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. Before that, people did not need news every day or week. Newspapers have a fixed format, but online news is different. Online, people can choose what news they want to read. They can get updates quickly and see full documents. Online news can correct mistakes fast. But online news often focuses on being first and getting comments, not on understanding. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand the world better in a chaotic time.'"

This is part of who we are, even if we don't often think about it. To make the night more like day, we have filled it with light. This is like building a dam in a river. It helps us, but it also causes problems called light pollution. Light pollution happens when lights are not designed well. They shine up into the sky instead of down to the ground. This makes the night less dark and changes the natural light patterns that many animals, including humans, need. Light pollution affects things like migration, reproduction, and feeding. In the past, light pollution was not a problem. For example, in 1800, London was the biggest city in the world, but it was still dark at night. People used candles and lanterns, and there were no streetlights. You could smell London before you could see its lights. We have lit up the night as if no animals lived there, but many do. Light is very strong and attracts animals. Birds can get confused by bright lights and fly around them until they are too tired. Some birds even sing at night because of artificial light. Light pollution was once thought to only bother astronomers, who need to see the stars clearly. But everyone needs darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can make us sick. Our sleep and wake cycles are connected to the Earth's light and dark cycles. Changing these cycles is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are affected by light pollution just like animals are. We have lost our connection to the stars and the natural day and night rhythm. Light pollution makes us forget our place in the universe and the beauty of a starry night.'"
92,"Text: 'The boss of a big company said his workers can take as much holiday as they want. This idea came from another company that did the same thing. The boss got the idea from an email from his daughter. Some people think this is just a way to make the company look good. But is it a good idea? The first company has 2,000 workers and does one thing. The big company has 50,000 workers and does many things like banking, transport, and healthcare. In a small company, workers know each other’s jobs better, so they can decide if taking a holiday is okay. The big company’s boss said workers can take holiday if they are sure their work is done and it won’t hurt the company or their job. But can anyone be that sure? When you come back from holiday, there is always a lot of work waiting. This can make workers feel guilty and stressed, which is bad for work in the long run. Also, workers might feel pressure from others about how long they take off. In many companies, people work late, and this might make them feel they can’t take holidays. If workers don’t have a set number of holidays, they might not take any because they don’t want to look lazy. Technology makes it hard to know when work stops and free time starts. The first company started this holiday idea because workers asked how it fits with working all the time. If there are no set work hours, all hours might feel like work hours. Workers might feel watched all the time, which is not good. Workers need holidays for their health. The good things like feeling happy and working better can happen without this holiday idea. So, I am not sure if letting workers take as much holiday as they want is really what the company wants or if it will work.'"
93,"Text: 'Journal-based peer review is a process where experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This is to make sure the research is good and not wrong. It can take up to a year to review a paper. Some people think this is important to keep trust in science, but others are not sure. The way scientific publishing works is changing. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before peer review. They help share new research quickly so others can read and discuss it. Publishing in journals is often about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can lead to problems. Scientists may leave out data to get published in top journals. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good. Preprints can help because they allow open discussion and critique by many people. Some worry that preprints might lead to bad science being shared, but this has not happened yet. Preprints let authors get feedback from a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, says preprints helped her share a critique of another paper openly. Preprints also allow sharing of negative results, which journals often ignore. They make papers more visible and cited by others. Preprints focus on the work itself, not where it is published.'"
94,"Text: 'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is like ‘a painting in words’. Their answers do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked them to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist, and another from the object's point of view, called ‘Poem.’ Here’s what one student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. The item? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class see how poetry works differently from anything else. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. When I was in school, poetry made little sense to me. I thought every poem was a confusing puzzle. After school, most people read poems less and less. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like normal writing. You try to read it, but often feel disappointed or confused. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we want from poems? Are they for deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever thoughts? Maybe. But for tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings please our eyes, and music – nothing beats its mix of words and melody. But poems can show us something else: ambiguity. Life is full of it, just like poems. But this still doesn’t tell us what a poem really is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it says ‘poetry': ‘a form of art using language’s beauty and rhythm.’ This is what professors say, but the word ‘poem’ comes from Greek, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So, what kind of thing is a poem? Poets sometimes say poems are like wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or like machines – precise and made by humans. But these ideas don’t fully explain poems. The best part of comparing poems to other things is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or an animal, this can change how you think about machines or animals. It helps us see things in a new way. Poems can stick in our minds, like song lyrics. Words and melody are powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine. A poem can touch us deeply, even though it is just ink on paper like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem? It could be used for a longer article or ad. A poem is written and rewritten like an article or story, but it is not made to be sold. Publishers send out poetry books, but they don’t expect to make money. A poem is not for the market, but for itself. Because it is special – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment.'"
95,"Text: I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I have found many brooches and coins. Each one makes me happy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 

One rainy February afternoon, I had some free time. I went to a place I knew had old farming machinery. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug down half a metre and saw a golden ball. I thought it might be brass, but as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, patterned loop. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. 

I took it home and washed it in the sink. I called Marion and showed her. We didn't try it on because it was too precious. I hid it in our wardrobe, but I was worried, so I moved it under a floorboard in my office. The law says I had to report it within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy it before giving it up, so I showed it to a friend in the hospital. Then I took it to the council office. The torc was real and sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was shared between the field owner and me. 

The torc is more than just money. I saved it for the nation. People ask if I will stop detecting now, but I still enjoy finding brooches and coins. Like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I keep going, hoping for another great find."
96,"Text: 'Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When friends tell me about their busy trips, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for naps in the afternoon and lazy mornings in bed? Better sleep is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept – more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Far from home, I could sleep deeply and have many dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes easier. I think sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. We process all this while we sleep, which makes travel sleep more intense. Sleep also changes with different places. People talk about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local habits is harder. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I truly belong there. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all took naps on hammocks and sofas. I finally understood the Latin American custom of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Away from my normal routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too.'"
97,"Text: The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one looks best on you,"" she said to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little hat will make me stand out."" She touched the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this is the one I want."" Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was happy to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also excited to meet Jen's friend, Tattie. Mia's husband, Jeff, had asked, ""What sort of name is that?"" when Mia told him about Tattie. ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia said. ""I think it’s nice."" Jeff did not like fancy things or people who pretend to be something they are not. He also did not like when Mia was too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. An hour later, Mia closed her shop and went home. Her shop was next to her house, so it only took forty seconds to get home. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia had the idea to turn the barn next to their house into a shop. Jeff was not sure it would work. ""Do you really think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew they did because her friends often said it was hard to find the perfect hat. She was right. After Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. They could try on many hats in a relaxed place. Mia also started selling handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"Text: 'Lawrence Okoye is from London and now lives in Atlanta, USA. He is on an amazing sports journey. Lawrence was in the Olympic final for discus throwing. Now, he might play American football for a big USA team, even though he has never played before. In Atlanta, he is learning his new position in football. It is surprising that a 21-year-old from London might join a top American team. But Lawrence is used to surprising people. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but chose to train for discus instead. In 20 months, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus. He wanted to prepare for the world championships. He thought about American football before but only decided to try it in the USA. He read about NFL trials in Atlanta and applied, even though he had never played. Was he nervous? ‘No,’ he says. ‘I don’t get nervous for many things.’ Lawrence is confident in his abilities. His test results were very good, and he was chosen as the most impressive player. ‘I was very happy to hear that,’ he says. But he knows he has a lot to learn. How can he join an NFL team with no experience? ‘Coaches say I have what I need. It’s about how hard I work,’ he replies. Is he worried about being selected? ‘I’m not worried. There’s no pressure on me,’ he says. Lawrence had a bad experience in the Olympic final when he came last. But he is happy he made it to the final. ‘That was an amazing day,’ he says. ‘The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s sport.’ After the Olympics, some people thought he was affected by the loss. Lawrence doesn’t comment on this. NFL players earn a lot of money, over $400,000 a year. Lawrence has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Should he focus on one sport? ‘I understand why someone would say that,’ he says. ‘I’m trying to do something I dreamed about as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought out.’'"
99,"Text: 'We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. I looked out of the window at the empty land below. The dark brown and green colors made me feel better. It was mid-September, but it had not started snowing in Siberia yet. I saw no people, just mountains, streams, and forests going on forever. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. ‘Good morning, Robert,’ he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to sell safety clothes to the local mines. His English was almost as bad as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I told him I was going to Magadan in far-eastern Siberia with a one-way ticket. I wanted to go back to England by bicycle. ‘But, Robert,’ he said, ‘there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle.’ I said I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. ‘Alone?’ he asked. ‘No, with a friend called Al.’ ‘Just one friend?’ ‘Yes, just one,’ I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and said ‘Holodna’ (cold) while pointing outside. I tried to show him with hand gestures that I had warm clothes, but I did not say that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought cheaply. I was not sure they would work well. This was true for my big postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of tired students. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer talked on and on. I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? ‘Well, why not?’ I wrote a note, ‘Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.’ In front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He read it, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I opened it and read, ‘OK’. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. I was still learning how to control my classes, but the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, and I had long holidays to go on adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I went to meet Al. He loved adventures after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since our first ride, Al had been taking on bigger challenges. This trip around the world by bike was his biggest one. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would be too hard. It sounded tough, but I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge. He was proving wrong the people who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him almost every day, and it made him feel alive.'"
100,"Text: 'In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns to fly through tall pylons, which are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to see what it feels like to join. An hour before the flight, I signed two forms. The first said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small things can be dangerous during the flight. I learned I had to stay aware of where I was. 'The horizon is your best friend,' they told me. 'The pilot will tell you where to look.' I also promised to relax when flying upside down and enjoy the view. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. They told me not to touch anything. When we were on the runway, my legs were up, and I tried not to touch the steering pedals or switches. I decided not to relax and enjoy the flight. In high-speed flying, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense and relax at the right times. Panicking is bad. This was not comforting as we started moving. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway. We were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and we turned sharply to the right. It was a quick move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach high up and my lungs tight. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, flying between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but a sharp right turn took my excitement away. We hadn't done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I flew the plane. My hand shook, and the plane shook too. Then Dario said something. I asked him to repeat, but he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. 'Are you okay?' 'Yes.' 'Have you had enough?' 'No,' I lied. Then he did a loop, flying in a full circle. Some people find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a voice saying, 'Relax, look up.' I looked up and saw fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was 'soft' compared to what pilots do in races. To show this, Dario ate sandwiches happily after we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night I dreamed of doing loops again and again.'"
101,"Text: Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature documentary, it might be filmed by him. He likes the temperature to be -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, where he learned about living in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I took the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I knew that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife series. ‘I started at a good time. When I began, not many people had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is easier to film today. If you filmed something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can film a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You filmed less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not tell which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film for a big TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a world of polar bears and is very hard to visit. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very hard. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We move to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"Text: 'In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies. He had to swim in very cold water and face frostbite and polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic for a new expedition. This time, Pen and two colleagues will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole in three months. They will measure the ice thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results are important for scientists. This will show what global warming is doing to the ice. Pen was trained for this. As a child, he was cared for by a woman who worked for a famous polar explorer. She sent him out in the cold with little clothing to make him tough. His father loved frozen adventures, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps with his polar guide business and says she worries more when he is at home. For fun, she once raced him in a mountain event. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. They live in the country with their two children. Pen says it is harder to leave them now. Last time, he told his son to take care of the family, which was too much for him. So, Pen plans to have little contact with them while in the Arctic. He is preparing his equipment carefully. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the photographer, will join him. A crew of six will fly in supplies. Pen says being in a team is more stressful for him. He is also worried because he is turning 47 and has not trained enough. He believes this mission is important for science. The data will help scientists understand the Arctic Ocean. Pen says their skills are now very useful.'"
103,"Text: I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. These activities were great, but I wanted something competitive. I wanted to stay in shape, so I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to my rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. If I entered, I would want to win. Would Ben help me win? Probably not. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. The race was possible, but it was expensive. The boat and equipment would cost £70,000. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete. People are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would give me something new to talk about: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. One big lesson was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but it was straightforward. I trained all day, nearly every day, with a set program, doctors, and dieticians. I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I was afraid it would look like I just wanted to be on TV. But my worries went away during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. But he couldn't row well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but Ben needed to improve a lot. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in the north of Finland. I was 26 years old and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, quiet places, different from noisy London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They let me work as a husky dog handler for the winter. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides with huskies across the ice and snow. The rides can last from one hour to five days. Anna and Pasi started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm’. It is a simple place with no running water. They said I could join them for three months if I understood the work was hard. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I look at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I need to learn their names, but I feel nervous. I stop looking at the page and look out of the window. People say spring moves north at about 26 km per day, with flowers and leaves opening. But I see winter moving south, and the rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is what I hoped for. We drive through dark forests with snow-covered trees, stopping sometimes for reindeer. I arrive at the farm after dark and get boots to go outside. 'Do you want to start right away?’ Anna asks. I hear barking, which gets louder as I reach the dogs. Three people are getting the huskies ready for sleds. The dogs are very excited. I can’t hear well to introduce myself, and the others are busy. I stand by and pet a quiet dog. Someone tells me to get in a sled, and we go into the dark with only a headlight. November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to learn to be a husky guide, but first, Anna asks if I am useful. I don’t know. I have never driven a snowmobile, done woodwork since school, or chopped with an axe. 'Do you have a driving licence?’ someone asks. I nod, feeling better. The basics of dog-sledding are easy: lean into corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and don’t let go of the handlebar. But other things are hard. Feeding and watering the dogs is difficult in the cold. Water freezes quickly, so we make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of the first week, I am tired from pulling sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I feel proud. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,"Text: 'On that day, Radcliffe ran very fast past the finish line. The press was there to talk about her amazing run. Her time was so good that she could compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had told her to use it after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she didn't really understand how big her achievement was at the time. She and her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometres, Radcliffe's agent was worried she was running too fast and might not finish the race. Hartmann was angry about this but understood why someone might think it was risky. With 800m left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometres very fast and finished the last part in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would beat that time soon. Radcliffe thought she would try again next year, but it didn't happen. After the race, people wanted to know how she beat the East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her a lot, helping her with the pain from running 250-300 kilometres each week. He said she was very tough and could handle a lot of pain. Hartmann would travel from Ireland to her training place in France. When he arrived, her husband would say, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ She was ready for a two-hour session. Hartmann gave so much time to Radcliffe that other athletes were upset. Radcliffe doesn't know why no one has beaten her record. She trained very hard but thinks others are more talented. She thought Mary Keitany might do it. Radcliffe says maybe people race each other more than themselves. She always pushed herself hard, even when she was winning. That marathon was the best of her career. She never ran that fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running.'"
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, started, I didn't know how people would like it. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I thought our show was new and different, but I was worried. Would people like a cooking show that talked about techniques, history, and science? I watched the first show feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to other projects, like a book about my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often real, with travel and meeting new people. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest book. In it, you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best pasta. These people have spent years trying to be perfect. Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But after a long meeting, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on feelings and memories. I knew the recipes were not 'perfect', but I used my skills and talked to food experts to find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV series let me explore new foods, people, and places. I was excited to find the best ingredients, which took me around the world. Some adventures were funny, like visiting a factory with the wrong tomatoes, or a dairy farm that was not good enough to film. I even tried new cooking methods, like hand-milking a cow for ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down to make pizza!'"
107,"Text: 'We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field. It stopped moving. John got out and looked at the engine. He stood there for a long time. ‘Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,’ he said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field was big, with grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I said, because it was always good to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John walk away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’ So I told them about two birds I heard talking in London. They talked about breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. They argued about a worm. ‘That’s silly, no one understands bird language,’ Bea said. My eyes hurt. ‘I do.’ But I didn’t sound sure. ‘Liar.’ I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought, the less sure I was. ‘Mum…?’ But she was asleep. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her. We followed John into a café. It was near the road where our van was parked. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘It might be expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked in the pot. ‘It’s like syrup,’ she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. ‘It’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said when it got dark. Mum put blankets on the ground for us to sleep in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ‘I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,’ John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we’d get home since our van needed to be pulled. I thought it might be easier to take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep.'"
108,"Text: 'Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel. She was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe. Lucy didn't hear her name well, maybe it was Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy. They spoke English well and talked about the music they played and their travels. Lucy said, ‘I think I'm going to Tanglewood this summer.’ It sounded impressive. But Lucy didn’t really want to go. She didn’t want to do many of the things that took her around the world. She missed so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. She studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. Lucy didn’t even want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen pianists her age were chosen from around the world. Her dad bought her a necklace to celebrate, and her brother Gus dreamed of going to the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for dinner to plan her music. Lucy didn’t apply to the festival. Her mom did it for her. ‘I didn't want you to be sad if you didn’t get in,’ her mom said. Lucy thought her mom didn’t want her to say no. Lucy used to think saying no was bad, so she didn’t try to avoid it. The guy from Tokyo asked, ‘Tanglewood?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘How old are you?’ ‘Fifteen.’ He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, ‘Wow.’ Lucy didn’t want to brag. It was hard to know when sharing was showing off. ‘It's just a new thing for young people...’ Liesel/Louisa left to talk to someone else. Tokyo stayed. ‘Have you been to Japan?’ He had long hair, like many musicians. ‘Once. When I was eight.’ Lucy's grandfather came and said, ‘Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.’ He took her away. ‘Don’t get too friendly with the competition.’ ‘They're not the competition.’ ‘Everyone is the competition.’ Her grandfather made her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but didn’t hear everything. In the elevator, her grandfather said, ‘You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This festival is important, and people know you.’ Lucy liked being known. Even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a pianist didn’t make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care about her music skills. But at the festival, she felt important.'"
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to go out into the real world,’ said Dad. He is hard to argue with, so I wanted to see what experts say. It is interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, feel they belong, and learn important skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social networking is a big part of modern childhood. Teenagers live in it, not just use it like adults. It is not good or bad; it depends on how you use it. Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it is like hanging out at a youth club, like parents did when they were young. It helps teenagers find their identity and learn to deal with teenage issues. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says social networking helps teenagers ask, ‘Who am I?’ You can share your favorite music or sports and see different views. Research shows social networkers are not as self-centered as those who do not use social media. It can help shy people because online communication can be easier than face-to-face. Professor Andrew Phillips studies young people using social networks. He thinks it helps quiet people with special interests connect with others. If you like a rare type of music, you can find others online who like it too. Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online and create content are using social networks well. Social networking is becoming creative. Teenagers make videos, podcasts, and blogs about their interests. Photo-sharing sites help photographers learn and share. This helps with jobs because businesses use social media to sell and promote. If you have 1000 friends on social networks, they can be customers. Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit in their future jobs, says Matthews. Working with others to create and share content is a key skill for the 21st century."""

But my parents wanted something different for our summer vacation this year. My dad planned a big family trip. He said, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" and my twin brother and I were not sure it was a good idea. In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With the car full, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" We left our big home for smaller places to stay for the next five thousand miles. We drove west through Oklahoma. We had some adventures, like almost getting caught in a dust storm. We learned that cows have the right-of-way on the road! The next day, we woke up early and kept moving. We saw deserts and mountains. Each day was different. We visited the Great Sand Dunes and Pagosa Springs in Colorado. The smell of sulfur there was strong. We learned that some roads are better for Jeeps. We saw old and new things everywhere. We laughed when we saw the ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We saw many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park. There, we saw bears near the road. Traffic stopped to let them cross. We had a close encounter with a bear and a park ranger. It was unforgettable. As we traveled, we forgot about home. Even the old hotel we stayed in, with no internet, was fun. The views were amazing. After a rainstorm in Canada, we drove back home. My parents were right. You don't need to go far to see something special. It was nice to be home, and I didn't fight with my brother during the trip! We took three thousand photos of our journey. I knew I would remember the unplanned and fun moments.'"
111,"Text: 'Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school and live at the college. She had a nice room with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would still watch over Amy. Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. Rose only remembered her grandmother from holidays. She never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose’s parents were not very happy, but Daisy insisted. Rose did not know why her parents did not like her grandma, but there had been a problem in the past. Rose was ten years old when she last saw her grandma, but she had happy memories. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy liked to meet people and bring them together. Rose would soon have dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady. Daisy went to many social events. Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new phone for emergencies. Rose was happy. They agreed to trust each other. Rose would act mature, and Daisy would not be too strict. If there were problems, they would talk. Rose was not a wild child. Her school friends were like her, so her school reports were good. In five weeks, Rose would start a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth school in five years. She felt experienced. This was the last time she would change schools. She would start her final two years. For Rose, it was a new start in her life.'"
112,"Text: Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to think she might write a novel. ""I thought writing a book was a big achievement because it seemed hard. I didn't know what other teenagers were doing, like being in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought: 'I might as well try this now.'"" The novel Charlotte started then is about to be published. ""I told my old teacher about it, and she was surprised. She thought I would do it when I was 30 or 40. I didn't understand why I should wait if I could be good at it now.""

It's a winter afternoon at Charlotte's publisher's office. Even though I knew I was going to talk to a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a big achievement: the story is strong and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of its main character, shows it was written by a teenager. The book's public relations person is with us in case Charlotte needs help. But she doesn't need any support. She is confident, smart, and steady.

Charlotte knows she is young. I ask her about the big questions in her book. ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don't have many life lessons for my readers,"" she says, laughing. ""I don't think my age limits my understanding of the world, but I'm not very wise. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.""

She has an idea about teenagers and the books written for them. She says there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows nothing, and the awkward teenager who isn't good socially. Reading about these types annoyed her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who are okay. Some writers make teenagers feel they can't know who they are because they aren't experienced. This can hurt their self-belief.""

Charlotte has always liked reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost stopped her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers talk about deep things. I asked myself: do I have to do this to write a good book, and can I do it?"" She likes a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It says if the reader guesses what will happen, the suspense is gone.""

Some might say Charlotte's parents, who are journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father's friend in publishing helped get her book read. She knows she was lucky because getting a first novel read is hard, no matter the author's age. ""Every writer needs support and luck, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talent, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte says."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with ski-jumping, went first. He skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew up, but something was wrong. We watched carefully. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed can be tricky.’ Maybe I wasn’t ready for this freestyle skiing. On other skiing holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers who did tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it. My parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing centre in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes. After practising inside, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progress is sure!’ the centre’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, new ski jumpers just went down the slopes and hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down again. Land in the right place and you keep moving. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs would slow down, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth talked to us. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then I was in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more problems before I finally landed right. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But that didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I didn’t slow down, jumped, and landed in the right place. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope, not on my feet."""
114,"Text: 'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight as the ride stops and then slowly goes up. There is a pause. Then, it drops quickly, and you feel your stomach lift. You move fast, turn left, and go upside down. You scream because you are scared. But you chose to be there, like many people who visit theme parks every year. Amusement parks are a big business. They have exciting rides to attract people. Many people work behind the scenes to make these rides. There are engineers, designers, and marketing experts. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' sounds like a child's dream job. But it is hard work. They must make rides fun and safe. They also need to make new rides to keep people coming back. Most of the ideas used in rollercoasters today were invented by John Miller in the early 20th century. Back then, rides were more extreme, but now designers must follow rules. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts said it is about making people feel excited but safe. Rollercoaster teams create stories, like a space adventure, to make the ride fun. Professor Walker said that experience and testing are important. Jeff Hornick, a theme park director, said designers need to love thrills to understand what people want. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said it can add to the ride, but the real rollercoaster experience will always be important.'"
115,"Text: 'Miranda Ellington is 25 years old and has done a lot as a choreographer. She makes dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. She says dancing helps her remember what it feels like to follow orders from choreographers. This can be hard and stressful. As a choreographer, she teaches and likes working with young students. New dancers like to try new ideas and are open to taking risks. They want to succeed but do not know their strengths and weaknesses well. They accept criticism and sometimes give feedback, which Miranda likes.

When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on dance steps and lets the music guide her. Even if she does not like the music, she tries to create the best dance routine. If dancers do not like the music, it can be frustrating, but she must find solutions. She cannot change the music because it is already chosen for big productions. She wishes she could try different music to make rehearsals better.

Miranda does not want to work with just one theatre or school. She thinks it is important to meet new people and adapt to different styles. This helps her not to become stuck in one way of working.

There was a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says it shows the real life of a dance company. One scene shows a dancer getting many corrections, which is common. Ballet requires a lot of work and dedication, which people do not always understand.

I asked Miranda what makes a great dance show. She says it is when music, costumes, lighting, and dancers all work well together. Perfection is hard, but aiming high is good. Sometimes, good dance steps are ruined by bad costumes or props.

Miranda has done many types of work. She does not want to be known for just one style, like modern dance or ballet. She wants to try many things and not be limited to one area.'"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience? That conversation gave me the idea for my four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Several friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me. I have been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest show on TV. You can see the film on my website.'"
117,"Text: 'When I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I usually travel with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. At the Greek port, the man was curious when I asked for one ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I told him I would join ten others to swim around the islands. He was still a bit confused, but he smiled and showed me to the boat. Our group had sent emails before we started, but there was little time to talk before our first swim. Our guides said a support boat would be with us all the time, and they showed us how to talk to it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first 1.5 km swim. I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was happy when I did it on my own. The next days were the same: jumping in; swimming at a good speed; stopping to look at the scenery. As the swims got longer, my speed and happiness grew. We did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come again next year.'"

I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. This makes it a good job for a young person like me! As a child, I went to a school in another country, away from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers. Some of them let me help. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and find something new. At the interview, there were many young people, and many got the job. They were often very qualified like me and wanted a career change. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and past work experience, not just that I loved to travel. I got the job! I recommend this job to anyone because there are many good things about it. The free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and we say, ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It feels like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. When I am not working, I don’t have to take work home. If I have difficult passengers, which is not often, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!'"

Most children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after we encourage them, they try and reach the top. This makes them feel happy. Some children miss home at the start of the week. It's not the very young ones who miss home the most – it's the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we say they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's too late now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine after a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time. Sometimes, it's not the children who feel lonely. Some parents call a lot, asking how their child is, which is not needed. Often their child is busy, playing games or doing something else, so we tell the parents to call back later. We often see a certain type of child coming, usually wearing expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why.'"
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show. The actors must also be good musicians. It opened in London last year after five years in the USA. In the USA, it was voted ‘Best Musical’ four times! In the UK, it was hard to do the show with only British actors. In the UK, young actors can do fewer shows each week than in the USA. So, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. The director found many talented UK actors, and they won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. The London theatre is bigger than the one in the USA, and it is full every night. People want to hear the songs that were popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘It’s great that I get paid to play, especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me the young actors are busy. ‘We have school lessons at the theatre every day. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ What do his friends think of the show? ‘My whole class came! The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. They loved it, and that made me feel confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he said. I told Jamie I also play guitar. He found a spare guitar and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days. I didn’t know it, but Jamie helped me. I was happy when I finally played it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! The young actors were already musicians, and some play many instruments, but none had played in a band before. They found it easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show is in London for another year, and it is worth seeing.'"
