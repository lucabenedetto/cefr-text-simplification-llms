1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing everything online might have negative sides. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost. Is this depressing? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame—long before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" as it was called then, mostly used by students and scientists. The web was invented at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was the work of an exhibitionist, there was also a beauty to his project that some might call art. One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to all the vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because we can say anything online doesn't mean we should."
2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't have all the answers about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to publicly criticize the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.

At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film talked about how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film discussed discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. However, the film only showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy, and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is simple and clear. But scientists usually respond with skepticism, saying, ""Give me a break."" They want solid proof that the effect is real, and pretty photos of crystals are not enough.

The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere, linked to a force driving the expansion of the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. Discoveries now show that the universe is indeed stranger than we imagined. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy.""

Beyond the film, other discoveries are equally amazing. Neuroscientists found that our conscious perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this delay out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.

Science is far from complete. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some of the world's top theoretical physicists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people think the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,"Text: 'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. These two activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and vice versa. These two types of writing might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. After starting my career with two short novels in 1975, I began writing short stories from 1984 to 1985. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this new side of me. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can be endless). It’s not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That’s it. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I’ll make it through. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small things – an idea, a word, an image. It’s often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn’t work, you just accept that not all stories can be great. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write masterpieces every time. This is comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like soft shadows I’ve left in the world, faint footprints. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, its dangers are misunderstood, and its importance is both overestimated and underestimated. People often ignore its mistakes or exaggerate them. Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced, and new ideas are sometimes mocked before becoming accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. This book looks at science as a series of ideas that have changed not just science but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book focuses on ideas, their beauty, and their limitations. Science is always changing. Scientists often disprove each other's ideas, but this usually doesn't affect society much. Sometimes, though, big changes in science can challenge our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned this view, showing that observing the universe can change it. Some people think science can't fully explain the universe, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover, but then came many breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, and quantum mechanics. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people think we are close to a complete theory of the universe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last two centuries, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists need to understand scientific advances because they affect the world and future generations. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. Deciding the future is not just for philosophers; it affects budgets, health, and even life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised new doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books keeps coming up. Whether people are predicting or dismissing this idea, the thought of books disappearing continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium replacing another often follows new technologies. Even before digital technologies, people predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and on factory floors. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some believed the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the death of the book often appears during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our hopes and fears about technological change. To understand why these reactions are common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we develop close bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it doesn't just mean economic and social change; it also affects our bond with something integral to our daily lives. As technology advances, we long for what we used to know but no longer have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older form. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about the disappearance of print books. Yet, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be an appealing story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we make sense of change is by using familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings. Easy to remember and share, the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For nearly every weekday morning over a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years managed their daily routines. I explored how they found time each day to do their best work and how they organized their schedules to be creative and productive. By examining the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, showing them as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward."" In this way, my book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the final product; it focuses on the process rather than the meaning. But it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something of your inner self. My book addresses questions I struggle with: How do you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to dedicate yourself entirely to a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time, to ""work smarter, not harder,"" as my dad says? I don't claim to answer these questions definitively—some may only be resolved individually—but I have tried to show how various successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to illustrate how big creative visions translate into small daily actions and how working habits influence the work itself. The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it focuses on people's routines. A routine suggests ordinariness and a lack of thought; it’s like being on autopilot. However, a good routine can help you make the most of limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A solid routine creates a groove for your mental energies and helps avoid being controlled by moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself was a procrastinator and struggled with keeping a regular schedule. Interestingly, it was procrastination that led to this book. One Sunday, while trying to write a story for the architecture magazine I worked for, I ended up tidying my cubicle and making coffee instead. As a ""morning person,"" I am focused in the early hours but less productive after lunch. To feel better about this, I searched online for other writers' schedules. I found them entertaining and thought someone should collect these stories, leading to the Daily Routines blog I started that afternoon and eventually this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of routines I found in biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more thoroughly while keeping the original's brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources. This book wouldn't have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have documented all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of an increase in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, decided that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. There, on a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From that moment, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of his university studies, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was interested in the earliest times, not in the more popular areas like the Jurassic period with dinosaurs. He studied ancient, delicate creatures found in grey rocks. When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job, especially in the kind of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving something doesn't always mean you get it. He understood that while science aims for truth, getting an academic job can be complicated. When a job at Tavistock College in London was advertised, he applied immediately, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had an argument with his wife, crashed his car, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and the professor who replaced him disliked the candidate the first professor supported. This new professor made sure Howard got the job. Howard was surprised by the unexpected support from someone he didn't know and was grateful until a colleague explained what really happened. Howard was only a little disappointed. It would have been nice to think he was the best candidate or that he impressed everyone with his skills and personality. But by then, the important thing was that he had the job and could do the work he loved. He often thought about how his professional life was organized and planned, unlike the chaos of personal life. Sometimes, strangers can change your life, as Howard found out when his briefcase, with notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, Howard went back to the college, postponed the lecture, and reported the theft. Then he went for a coffee and met a colleague with a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This is how Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed studying, which would be his biggest challenge and secure his career. If not for the theft, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. Within half an hour, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they look like maggots, they have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Through his research on how our senses combine to create our perception of flavor, Spence is quietly influencing what we eat and drink. This includes the products of large food companies (he advises one well-known multinational and receives funding from another) and the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues, through a field informally known as gastrophysics, have studied in detail how we experience food and drink. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates and cutlery, and background noise all affect taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting insights for anyone who enjoys eating. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence's lab in Oxford is quite simple. ""Low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff,"" he admits. There are soundproof booths that look like large safes, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less serious in universities. But now, since the government wants universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research is seen as valuable. Spence is currently helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often due to government regulations. It's in their interest, he says, to help customers live longer. Surprisingly, many companies make these changes quietly, so regular consumers don't notice. ""Research shows that if you tell people about the changes, they focus on the taste and don't like it as much,"" he explains. Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a major food producer. ""At the time, people thought: 'Science and food – that's horrible,' but most food is scientific. Who better to change that mindset than Heston?"" Through their collaboration, the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish was created at Blumenthal's five-star restaurant. Interestingly, Spence notes that the Italian futurists, an early 20th-century art movement, were ""doing sounds of croaking frogs with frogs legs a century ago,"" but it didn't become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. His recent findings show that high-pitched music enhances sweetness, while low-pitched sounds make food taste bitter. ""It's always surprising when shapes affect taste, or when a tune can change how you perceive a flavor,"" he says. An airline will soon match music with food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says happens often. What are dinner parties like at Spence's home? Once, they ate rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. ""We've had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and 10 different drinks to see if they have different pitches."" For Spence, home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows. Smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is an illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried something will fall. Even though we think we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause mental fog. Multitasking creates a craving for distraction, rewarding the brain for losing focus. The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain, is easily distracted by new things. This is a problem because we need this part of the brain to stay focused. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former professor of psychology, calls it info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while an email is unread in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. Wilson showed that the mental losses from multitasking are greater than those from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning new information while multitasking sends it to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is hard on our brains. Small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones, leading to poor decisions. In discussions with business leaders and scientists, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not the email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other things done."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions would have been seen as unimportant. Animals had behaviors, these behaviors had measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. The idea that animals have feelings and moral systems was considered sentimental. But recently, this has started to change. Research into the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has led scientists to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness? This debate leads to another one: not about consciousness, but conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong. In a recent experiment with cows that had to open a locked gate to get food, it was found that those that opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure – by jumping and kicking their legs – than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but their interpretation is. According to Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" the only logical response to this new research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the verge of a major ethical revolution. According to Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. He believes that animals do have a theory of mind, but it’s simpler than ours. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop attributing human characteristics to animals. The three may never agree because the issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is nearly impossible, can we ever know, as philosopher Thomas Nagel asked, what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an experiment he did that seems to show that starlings – a type of bird – can get depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. Half were in spacious cages with plenty of space and water. The other half were in small, barren cages. Initially, both groups were fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and soon learned to take only from the tasty box. But later, when the birds were offered only unpleasant worms, only those in spacious cages would eat. It seemed, or at least Balcombe concluded, that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. ‘We look back with horror on an era of racism,’ he says. ‘Our view about animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.’ If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his view. Manning has written a textbook, ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" ‘What we are seeing is a pendulum swing,’ he says. ‘At the turn of the 20th century, some people thought animals were just like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are going the other way. But it is a highly debated subject, and you want to avoid the sound of academics with personal grievances and strong opinions.’"
11,"**Simplified Text:**

Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way to understand what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, a research director at the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K. and a former computer science lecturer, says that people often think arguments help find the truth. While technology helps us store and process information, there is worry that it changes how we solve complex problems and makes deep thinking harder. West notes that we face a lot of poor but attractive ideas and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. Surprisingly, having more data doesn't always lead to better knowledge or decisions. 

The National Endowment for the Arts reports that literary reading has dropped by 10 percentage points, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media has a cost. She suggests that less reading might lead to weaker critical thinking because people now focus more on real-time media and multitasking. However, we still don't have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. Technology's influence on thinking is complex, and it can have both positive and negative effects. For instance, a computer game might help or harm critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis skills, but constantly clicking links might reduce deep thought.

Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers on learning and technology, says that technology changes how we think. She notes that reading helps imagination and critical thinking in ways that video games and TV do not. However, visual media can improve some types of information processing. Unfortunately, most visual media are fast-paced and don't allow time for reflection or imagination. As a result, many people, especially younger ones, may not reach their full potential.

How society views technology affects how it sees critical thinking. This is especially true with video games and thinking skills. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, argues that video games can be good for learning. Evidence shows that games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills. These games let players explore ideas in ways that might not be possible otherwise. In the digital age, as reading and math scores drop, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and motorcycle mechanic. He left office work because he was unhappy with it. His first book talked about the benefits of manual work. His latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book while shopping. He noticed ads on the credit card machine while entering his pin. Crawford realized that these ads are hard to avoid and take our attention. He believes that what we focus on is personal, but we are losing control over it. It's becoming harder to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people are closing themselves off and avoiding simple interactions like talking to strangers. Crawford says we experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us. These things reflect our desires and can take over our lives. Many people are worried about this. For example, office workers complain about emails but spend their free time on them. Studies show that just seeing a phone can distract us. There is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford thinks technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves. With so many choices, it's hard to control ourselves, which affects society. We prefer texting to talking because it's easier. Crawford argues that by only interacting with representations of people, we lose something important in society. Screens are part of the problem. He uses his gym as an example. It used to have one music player for everyone, which could cause tension. Now, people listen to their own music with ear buds, making the gym less social. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public. More importantly, he suggests engaging in skilled activities. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples. These people deal with real situations and can't be replaced by representations. They use good judgment and work with others. Crawford says that when you engage with the world this way, fake experiences seem less appealing. He doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but that it's important to use your judgment. This has benefits beyond job satisfaction. Constant distractions are tiring and make it hard to focus. Paying attention to one thing helps you focus on others."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, this question is easy to answer. However, when you are a philosopher, like me, it can be more difficult. Calling yourself a philosopher might sound pretentious. Saying you study or teach philosophy is fine, but claiming to be a philosopher can seem like you are claiming special knowledge. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why does this stereotype exist? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) said that a life of contemplation, or a philosophical life, was the best. Few modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked to thinking deeply. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just accepting cultural norms is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make decisions. But living an examined life doesn’t mean reading a lot of philosophy books or spending all your time thinking. It means looking closely at everyday experiences to see if they are important. It doesn’t mean living like a wise person away from society. To help guide people, the examined life should be practical and shared, as it is part of a good life. Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from real life, especially for people without formal training. This is partly because of university funding and the focus on expensive academic journals. Philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. For most people, philosophy can seem far from reality. If philosophers once challenged this view, many have stopped. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy focus on specific, technical debates, explaining them to non-experts is very hard. Philosophy, in some cases, has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about evaluating human actions. But recently, I feel this title doesn’t fully describe my work. Ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. This is a new development in philosophy: ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often discuss them. However, philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start with whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people examine the actions and beliefs that shape their lives. Sometimes this confirms what we know; other times, it shows our beliefs are hard to justify. Either way, by examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies, gourmands, and chefs, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. Historically, though, philosophers have often used food as a way to talk about other topics, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related ideas. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus talked about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is now often linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and online recipe sites, likely because these businesses think it will help them sell more if people associate their products with a famous philosopher. Food is naturally social and cultural. It comes from historical backgrounds and is shared with people in our communities. These communities give us dining partners and the systems to grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than any other product, making it an interesting topic for philosophical study. Once food is prepared, critics start discussing and writing about it. But why do they have such a special status? One philosopher has pointed out that tasting food is not a special skill; rather, food critics are just better at describing tastes. This area has been overlooked because most philosophical studies on perception focus on vision, not taste. Another part of food is its aesthetics. We often call paintings or music beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern cooking, food should be part of aesthetic discussions like art or poetry. However, food is eaten and destroyed, unlike art, which lasts over time. So, some think food cannot be considered an object of aesthetic value. There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices. Another topic is how cooking at home differs from cooking in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of personal relationships. In home kitchens, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are only open to qualified people, and their relationships are professional. A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by enjoying others' food and by forming personal connections through shared meals, a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The essay includes many examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy interesting for general readers.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were not exciting or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a storyline or if decisions made in one game could affect the next. He changed a classic board game called Risk to make a new version: Risk Legacy. In this version, decisions made during the game have a lasting impact. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules at key moments. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and long-term rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau was then asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players try to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was praised, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was the first game not based on an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players become explorers in a new world. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. To do this, designers use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga, a play-tester for SeaFall, said: ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.’

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a niche interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is really different and I think it’s good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks a lot of rules. I thought it would be successful with a few people. I thought I would be known as the guy who did this unusual project.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He sees it as a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and you get that all the time with legacy games.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the adventure of the game was more important than worries about the game’s lifespan. ‘At first, there was worry about changing and damaging your board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It’s adding a story like in video games.’ The legacy format is influenced by video games and the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV series. While in college, Daviau wanted to be a TV writer but moved to advertising and then game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares the legacy design process to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start,’ he said. ‘But it’s not enough to just have an outline.’

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is interested to see where others take the idea. But he also thinks people might soon ask: ‘What’s next?’ Colby Dauch, studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is less sure. For him, the legacy format has changed how people think about board games. ‘It’s the kind of idea that changes the way you think about what a board game can be.’"
16,"Text: 'One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a narrow drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children's film, was widely shared online. Part of the fun of such stories, including those about escaping rats and llamas, is imagining animals as having human-like qualities. This is especially true for octopuses, whose intelligence is surprising because their bodies are so different from ours. How can these sea creatures open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play? 

Anthropomorphism, or giving animals human traits, is often seen as unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that the real problem is anthropodenial—refusing to see human-like traits in animals. He shows that animals, except for fully-developed language, have many behaviors once thought unique to humans: thinking about the past and future, showing empathy and self-awareness, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.

De Waal believes anthropodenial is a modern idea. In medieval and early modern Europe, animals were thought to have complex minds and could even be put on trial. In the nineteenth century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, behaviorism, which focused on conditioning animals with rewards and punishments, changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines or robots with instincts. Thinking of animals as having inner lives was considered unscientific. This view coincided with humans destroying animal habitats, polluting, and raising livestock without considering their welfare.

Fortunately, de Waal believes we are moving past this view and starting to see animal cognition as similar to human cognition, though not the same. He notes the increase in knowledge about animals shared online. The best tests of animal intelligence consider a species' unique traits. For example, squirrels might fail human memory tests, but they can remember where they hide nuts. In her book The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might judge us on how many color patterns we can make on our skin. Seeing us fail, they might think we are not very smart.

De Waal doubts Inky's escape had a happy ending. While octopuses have escaped before, it's unlikely Inky knew how to find a drain to the ocean. However, de Waal recognizes that viral stories can increase appreciation for animal intelligence. He once tested if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers (a liked food) and others got grapes (a preferred food), those with cucumbers were upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video clip of the experiment convinced more people. This shows the unique nature of our human minds.'"
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialisation. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for many years, but experts now say that robots will soon be used in many more areas, and many countries are not ready for this big change. Most people agree that robots will change the way we work. However, while about two-thirds of people think robots will do most jobs in the next 50 years, 80% believe their own jobs will still exist. This is not true: robotic automation will affect every industry soon. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that would take two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a startup called Simbe Robotics has made Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check that products are stocked and priced correctly. Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot yet service or program themselves, which means new jobs for skilled workers. Critics warn that we should not ignore the importance of human skills at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will have laws about robots. In five years, salaries in robotics will rise by 60%, but many jobs will remain unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers. Zhang says that people with lower skills will be affected and should retrain, as they cannot rely on the government to protect their jobs. New developments in robotics will lead to robots that live with us and interact in advanced ways, similar to those in science fiction. This is a big opportunity for companies but also brings challenges, like the need for new safety and privacy laws. With many jobs at risk, education is key to preparing for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, reportedly answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" The reporter's question reflects a common curiosity: why would anyone engage in such a dangerous and seemingly pointless activity? Mallory's answer might inspire some people to pursue their dreams, as it challenges certain individuals to confront the unknown. However, the true value of his response is its simplicity, suggesting that climbing might be about adventure and fun. 

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay on climbing called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He identified seven different climbing activities, or ‘games’, ranging from bouldering to climbing Himalayan peaks, each with its own rules. He argued that the style of climbing, such as using more or less equipment, should follow the rules of the specific game. Over the years, this approach has become central to climbing discussions in the West, seen in climbing magazines and debates.

For many climbers, the love of climbing comes from the sense of freedom it provides. Yet, climbing can also be restrictive, like being stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and confining. However, the limited choices in climbing can also bring a simplicity that feels like freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective in his recent essay. He suggests asking, ""Why do people climb?"" to explore why humans, as a species, climb. Fitschen believes climbing is in our genes; it is natural for us to face challenges and test limits, even with risks. Therefore, the joy of climbing is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor adds another view in his recent essay, proposing that climbing helps develop virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. While not all climbers show these virtues, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing, then, has practical value by helping develop traits that are useful in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who do not rely on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred controversy by claiming that independent climbs, which are harder or riskier, deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or with aids like bottled oxygen. Their essay may have encouraged some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Exploring climbing beyond the Western perspective, climbers often talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, active meditation, and intuitive problem-solving in climbing are key aspects. Some argue that climbing is similar to Zen philosophy, which trains the mind for peace. This offers another reason why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known as an intellectual and sometimes serious person who focused on European piano music. He wrote and performed a lot but rarely taught. Those close to him saw a playful side, but it was not often shown in his concerts. His life was a disciplined routine of study, travel, and performance. Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take the request seriously. He had taught very few students and saw no reason to start now. He quoted another famous pianist: ‘You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ However, something about the boy, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played remarkably well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital where he played beautifully. Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that guided you from the first to the last note, which is rare to find in musicians. As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is slowly entering it, with Brendel cautious about him burning out early. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under the watchful eye of his mother. He also composes music. Brendel says, ‘Learning to read music is helped by trying to write something yourself. Kit has a phenomenal memory and is a great sight reader. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and to me when I explain something. He not only understands but can do it. When I tell him one thing in a piece, he applies it throughout the piece.’ Brendel is careful not to raise expectations. He is upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, saying it is harmful. Like many talented young players, Kit can play some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging. Now at 80, Brendel is more relaxed in his post-performing years. He explains, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them, but there was room for more, so I continued. Although I don’t have the physical strength now, my mind is active with pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform now, but it’s a nice new career.’"
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden wasn’t in a dirty city. It was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places of escape, peace, and solitude. Grandad’s garden wasn’t special in terms of features. He didn’t have a greenhouse, unlike some neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass was broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He wasn’t without humor, though. Silly things amused him, and he liked using certain phrases, like ‘It’s immaterial to me’. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn’t passionate about. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and Mum once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was very skilled around the house, making things like bookshelves and cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother often changed the furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I did like the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; lessons were for my sister. When I asked my mother later why I wasn’t given the chance, she said, ‘You’d never have practised’.

Of the three options, moors, woods, or river, I usually chose the river. I could escape into another world there. With a fishing net and old sandals, I’d walk along the riverbank, looking for a spot to take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic. I’d look for fish to catch with my net and take home. After failing to keep them alive, I’d return them to the water.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father said, ‘There’s a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, Dad went against his usual thinking. He might have preferred me to be a carpenter, but I like to think he believed things might work out if I stuck with it. Maybe I’m fooling myself, but I prefer to believe that, even though he hated gardening, he saw my passion for it and hoped for the best."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck, and so do I. An Atlantic storm threatens to blow us over the cliff and into the ocean 120 meters below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes up, and his owner gently strokes him. Despite the strong wind, MacEwen looks perfectly at home on his island. He is giving me a visual tour of the area. Pointing to the north, he shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds pouring rain on its large mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ When rain starts coming our way, MacEwen suddenly says, ‘I have sheep to move.’ We head down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Volcanic Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep interrupts our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is circling the sheep but not doing it well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ meaning the dog should circle to the right. He doesn’t; he goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie.’ MacEwen’s voice shows disappointment. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby love that their two boys can explore the island on their own and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They go out and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But island life has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I manage without electricity and mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck seems wonderfully unlikely. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians, who get off carrying instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with islanders tapping their boots to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay advertised in the newspaper and bought it without even seeing it. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know anything about running a farm? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the small island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and give it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, tasting incredibly good. Also uncertain: my ferry ride the next morning to my next island. In the past two months, many scheduled ferries had been canceled because of high seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, phone or no phone, was what I secretly hoped for."
22,"Text: 'The game design industry was once mainly for computer scientists and self-taught individuals, with few ways to enter. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now the video games industry is taken seriously. Industry experts are not surprised by this change. Creating video game spin-offs for new movies is challenging, needing many team members and months of hard work. Like many industries, it's hard to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says: ‘It’s hard to make progress in big companies or influence major games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just directors, but also those who design systems and specific parts of games.’ So, how can you enter this competitive field? Many companies prefer a degree in computer science, but Jim disagrees. ‘The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You need to create something to get a job or succeed independently. Game design is more a lifestyle than a job. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real.’ Another expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘Just doing it is important, but it’s more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs; even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense to contribute to this evolving field.’ Can you succeed alone? ‘Maybe, but it’s difficult,’ says John. ‘A good postgraduate course in games can help, offering support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all entertainment media and have a strong interest in arts and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and understand the growing diversity of the field. Connections are also important. To succeed in games, as in many areas, you need to network.’ The old stereotype of a teenage boy playing games has changed to a more accurate view of a mature medium. Families often play on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. ‘Games are becoming popular with larger audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this area as full of possibilities and opportunities.’"
23,"Since I was a child, all I’ve ever wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn’t force me, and I’m thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn’t do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and stopped playing football. I’m glad that didn’t happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I’ve practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. It’s only by practicing that you can score spectacular goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for years. Sometimes you see young players crashing into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, I try to show them how to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I don’t want it to be like that for my son. We’re already trying to read him books, even though he’s too young to sit still for long. I hope that his habit of kicking them around doesn’t mean he takes after me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so some of us younger players could join the first team, but he didn’t make a big deal about it. He never told us, ‘This is your big chance,’ but we knew we had to prove ourselves. Although I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely a lot on close friends and family. But having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people say, ‘I can’t believe you let your mother keep working.’ Of course, I’ve helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong and would be offended if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, I enjoy using my money to make life easier for those around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but it doesn’t solve everything. After I stop playing, I think I’ll take a year off or maybe longer to do things I haven’t been able to do. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can’t do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured."
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. Out of desperation, he offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father couldn’t write anything sellable in Los Angeles. This was bad for Sam, as he risked losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn’t popular with day-trippers. The road was not appealing, and the nearby resort, La Carmella, was more attractive for those with some money. Only people who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But with the hot weather, the place became busy with people. After months of being almost alone, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to meet a writing deadline and was in a bad mood. He didn’t notice that I spent most days on the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We didn’t have a dog when we first moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to adopt us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One day, I felt sorry for him and gave him water. My father half-heartedly threw a boot at him, but Rusty knew he wasn’t serious and stayed. I asked my father who Rusty might belong to, and he said, ‘He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes, he brought things that weren’t buried, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. Rusty also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. One surfer stood out to me. She was very skilled and made the others look clumsy. She decided to finish for the day and rode a final wave to the shore. She approached me and asked why I didn’t join them. I told her I didn’t have a surfboard and no money to buy one. She noticed my British accent and asked if I was visiting. I explained that I lived there because my father was writing a film script. She asked if she might know him, and I said his name was Rufus Marsh. She recognized his book, ""Tall as the Morning,"" and looked at me with new interest. I realized people were friendly but only became truly interested when I mentioned my father’s book."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long queue at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie, who often traveled, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this time the advice was wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers said there was a 'breakdown in the computer system,' which made the passengers frustrated. They had paid a lot for this trip, and the delay was not a good start. Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left it there because all her contacts were saved on the phone. Her son Harry always warned her about this kind of mistake. 

Violet asked a friendly couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message, asking him to contact her neighbor Kristina to see if the phone was in her flat. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn't tell Harry. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding because he shared her forgetfulness. 

Finally, the queue moved, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were fake walnut panels, lots of chandeliers, shiny brass, and airport-style carpets. She followed signs to the elevators, which were full of tired passengers. Violet was pressed against the side of the lift as it stopped at each floor. At last, she reached the twelfth floor and found her room, which thankfully had the balcony she had requested. She had paid extra to ensure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he didn't know he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing striking images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent morning, Maloof stood among these items, realizing he had stumbled upon something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’

For some time, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together Maier’s life story. They contacted local families who employed her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit eccentric, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘First thing in the morning on her day off, the camera would be around her neck, and we wouldn’t see her again until late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘I remember her as a private person but one who had very strong opinions about movies and politics.’

Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although she was not very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed to be passionate about her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams and what she wanted to do in life,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone or anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was done for commercial reasons. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of many other photographers in her pictures and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated and able to do this or was she inspired by those who came before her?’

Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he discovered Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural shots, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I progressed as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes were not what was important to her. It’s the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized that I was sitting on something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to get her name out there. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.’"
27,"Text: 'When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this isn't true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when the book was very popular, and she was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have happened, and a group of 12 men meets to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past gave more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I ask how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she answers modestly. ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. There’s a family feeling at home, I got a lot of congratulations from other people’s grandmas.’ Then she adds, ‘What is annoying is when people think I’m not trying to do something philosophical in the book.’ ‘I had the idea to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part was half the length of the one before it,’ said Catton. The book speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters whether the reader notices these things. ‘I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them.’ Despite the experimental structure, The Luminaries is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she says she didn’t plan the book beforehand. ‘I would write myself into a corner, and then see how creative I could be in writing myself out of it.’ It’s clear she also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We also talk about her love of TV drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue, I ask if she might be interested in screenwriting. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says. Her conversation is full of enthusiasm, with a low, secretive laugh. She becomes animated when talking about her craft and New Zealand. ‘I always notice when I come to Britain how much my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to busy areas, to be around many people.’ But for now, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I hope it gives her the inspiration she needs for many more novels.'"
28,"As a boy, Jonny Kinkead loved using tools in his dad’s garage and playing with a guitar. These two interests have been his career for the past forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still fascinated by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood create such a beautiful sound? And how do different types of wood make different sounds? It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a holiday job and save up for one,’ he says. ‘But I believed if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and woods affected the sound, and how to put them together.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been doing similar things with other items. ‘We designed model boats and planes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use saws, sharpen chisels, and things like that. I’d also been customizing and repairing instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he hadn’t thought of a career in guitar-making. ‘I was also interested in painting and sculpture,’ he says. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea at the time,’ he remembers. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out. ‘I was too individualistic for it,’ he says. ‘But I left with a clearer idea of what I wanted to do. I was still interested in sculpture, but I realized that guitar-making is a type of sculpture – one that involves shaping sound. And I thought it might be more practical than pure art because you’re making things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only covered the cost of the materials, but as he became known as one of the best guitar-makers, he could charge a bit more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just getting by’. He admits he can’t make more than ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. In the early years, he worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals most weekends to get musicians to try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments – when musicians asked, he didn’t have an answer because it didn’t come naturally to him. Jonny believes it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the only good acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as genuine, even though we’ve always had good instrument-making courses here and the skills have stayed the same. But now our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says valuable techniques can be learned in the classroom, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take the courses available. However, he also believes there is no substitute for trial and error. ‘The thing to do is to look at other instruments, see where people have succeeded or failed, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you’re taught by someone else, you only learn one way, but if you’re self-taught, like I was, you learn everything.’"
29,"Text: 'Any discussion about English conversation must start with the weather. This is a tradition, and like many others, I will quote the famous comment by the eighteenth-century diarist Dr. Johnson: ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This observation is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many people who write about this topic either stop here or try to explain why English people are 'obsessed' with the weather, but they often fail. They fail because they assume that when English people talk about the weather, they are really interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson notes that English weather is not very exciting, so the obsession seems strange: ‘To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it. All those phenomena that elsewhere give nature an edge of excitement, unpredictability and danger – tornadoes, monsoons, raging blizzards, huge hailstorms – are almost wholly unknown in the British Isles.’ English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson and argues that English weather is interesting because of its unpredictability. ‘Bryson misses the point. The English fixation with the weather is nothing to do with deep emotion – like the English countryside, it is, for the most part, dramatically undramatic. The interest is less in the phenomena themselves but in its uncertainty…one of those things you can say about England with absolute certainty is that it has a lot of weather. It may not include tropical cyclones, but life at the edge of an ocean and the edge of a continent means you can never be entirely sure what you are going to get.’ My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the point. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. English weather-talk is a kind of code that helps English people overcome their natural shyness and talk to each other. Everyone knows that phrases like ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ or ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ are not requests for weather information. They are greetings, conversation starters, or fillers to keep the conversation going. English weather-talk is like ‘grooming talk’ – similar to how monkeys and apes groom each other to bond socially. There are specific situations where weather-talk is used. Some writers say that English people talk about the weather all the time, but this is not true. In fact, there are three main situations where weather-talk is used: as a simple greeting, as an ice-breaker to start a conversation, or as a ‘default’ topic when there is an awkward silence. This does mean there is a lot of weather-talk, so outsiders might think English people talk about nothing else. An English conversation might start with a weather greeting, move to more weather-talk to break the ice, and then return to weather-talk if the conversation slows down. It is easy to see why people from other countries, and even some English writers, think English people are obsessed with the weather.'"
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were already interested, as they had chosen this trip over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not satisfying. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to add context and interest to life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching after 31 years, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. 

Alice found writing both exciting and challenging, but less exhausting than teaching. Her former colleagues envied her because she stayed connected with children through her books. Alice's main goal for her novels is to fill a gap in children's fiction today. She notes that much of adolescent fiction deals with negative experiences or is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books are different. Alice always tried to teach English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece alongside the novel ""Tale of Troy,"" and she is motivated by her love for children. She enjoys the moment when a child goes from being bored to interested and from not understanding to understanding. 

Alice sees her writing as an extension of teaching. She was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher also recommended a creative writing course, which surprised her. Although she had been teaching for 25 years, she was encouraged to attend the course. Before being accepted, she had to send her best piece of fiction, which she wrote quickly, creating a story about a Roman couple. The course participants gave her excellent feedback and suggested she publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as evidence of her writing skills, she asked for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, a critic and editor, helped her edit the novel. Alice says they complement each other, as he helps refine her writing while she focuses on adding new scenes."
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to compete in a special race. The race would be man against car, and brother against brother. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same point. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and it’s very cold right now, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay warm.’ Alistair was also eager. Unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, Alistair was dressed in full winter cycling gear. The cold didn’t bother him. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’

The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, about 350 meters up. This was no problem for the car, but Alistair’s first couple of miles involved a steep 25 percent incline, so he had a tough start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across the countryside to Fleet Moss. Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s early confidence was quickly challenged. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first obstacle: a giant tractor moving out of a field and onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all down to this farmer!’ After tense moments, Jonny got past the tractor and continued driving into the morning mist.

Meanwhile, Alistair was struggling with the slope. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out, he had a chance to show his skills. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair picked up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another local challenge. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have been there since before cars were invented, and the roads were not made for speed. Jonny tried to navigate a very narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream on the road. Once clear of the last village, the car was on a straight path to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. 

Finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ He raised his arms in victory. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car arrived, and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said, disappointed. ‘I’m gutted.’"
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all make you feel separated from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hard to focus only on the contest and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but as if from far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people around the arena or the millions watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my lifelong coach, taught me early on that this was the most important tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost twice against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The 2006 defeat wasn’t so hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer beat me easily, more easily than if I’d believed in myself more. But losing in 2007 left me very upset. I knew I could have done better; it wasn’t my ability that failed me, but my mindset. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and waste it. Toni, a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me; he criticizes me even when I win. But seeing how upset I was, he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might have been my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete’s career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more, and I let a big one pass in 2007. Toni couldn’t ease my grief, but he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I’d learned from that defeat; this time, my mindset would not fail me. The best sign that my mindset was right was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family, friends, and team members the night before the final, at the house we rent for Wimbledon, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t forbid them from mentioning it, but they knew I was already playing the match in my mind. From then until the start of play, that space was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: A young, idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa in April 1957. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" She spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. Her name was Jane Goodall. In 1963, Britain’s National Geographical Society helped make Jane Goodall famous by producing articles and TV documentaries about her chimpanzee research. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. Ironically, her fame might have overshadowed her real achievements. Many articles, interviews, and books have told her life story, but they often focus on limited and sentimental aspects. She has been portrayed as an adventurous girl, a privileged woman dreaming of life with wild animals, and a determined feminist. These images can undervalue her actual work. Based on references to her research, the success of her students, and the data from her 40-year study, Jane Goodall should be seen as a pioneering figure in her field and a leading zoologist. Her achievement can be simply stated: she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before Goodall, wild chimpanzees were seen as dangerous, and their behavior was misunderstood. No one knew they ate meat or used tools. We didn't realize they shared emotions with humans or had social systems like ours. We wouldn't have believed that chimpanzee communities had different cultural traditions. Goodall’s book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is the most authoritative work in this area, like an encyclopedia for chimpanzee research. Her long-term study in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements by biologist Stephen Jay Gould. Jane Goodall helped change how we study animals and how humans think about themselves. Even as a child, there were signs of the person she would become. One clear example from her childhood was in 1939 when she was five. One autumn day, Jane disappeared. The police and neighbors searched for her. After a frantic search, she reappeared with straw in her hair and clothes. Her mother asked where she had been. Jane explained she wanted to know how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours to find out. This moment is seen as the start of her career as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford speaks to me using the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to viewers of children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.’ Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors, even some very famous ones, think they can do funny voices, and many of them probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it than that. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get the parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley joined a drama course planning a standard acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon soundtrack. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a major part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and many forms, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes a range of things from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound enthusiastic about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a huge difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that specialize in helping voiceover artists put them together.’ She claims to have reached the top of her profession through persistence as much as natural talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or simply practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone considering a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"Text: 'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many dream about as kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more realistic jobs, like becoming a tax lawyer or making auto parts. The idea that you can make a living by drawing doodles like those in school notebooks seems silly. Yet, some people do just that. People don’t become cartoonists in the same way, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, after a typical cartoonist’s childhood (loving comic strips, contributing to school publications, being known as ‘the kid who draws’), I studied graphic design in college. After graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and in a few months, I was earning enough to support myself. You don’t need much to become a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, much money, or even to know how to draw well. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical barriers are low, but it’s still a tough job. No one should try to become a cartoonist unless they feel they can’t do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and leaves time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t turn down any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about everything. But what about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are almost over. Today, cartooning is mostly an entrepreneurial activity – you have to create and sell your work. The more comfortable you are with this, the better you’ll do. I’ve seen cartoonists with average talent and great business skills do better than artistic geniuses. It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they won’t let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright’, put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it’s not a disaster – it can be a very lucky break!'"
36,"Text: 'Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and clearing out old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually hate getting rid of things, so why did I want to throw this away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of trash when a young man came up to me, looking confused. ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ he asked. I said I was, already feeling a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said ‘Yes’. We went our separate ways. In the years that followed, I felt a constant regret for what I’d done. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. That’s how I felt when I opened an email from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He said: ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’ It had been bought and sold several times since the man at the dump took it. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back. He knew it was probably old, but he used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I almost cried. I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was fair. I had forgotten my dad’s habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this strange series of events! My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s when it was popular. I loved its calming sound, but I couldn’t make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. This was also the time of punk music, when people who couldn’t play well could still be rock stars. When I took my old guitar out of the box Keith sent me, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Picking it up again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then felt the need to stand up and put a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar is played this way. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t draw a diagram of the chords, but my hands just played them. My fingertips felt the pain of pressing the strings to play a chord. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll have to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are others my age who have had a similar experience. Maybe we could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!'"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was one of the few warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Insomniacs, whom I interviewed many of, will tell you that sleep is crucial for our mental, physical, and social well-being. Those who struggle to sleep often understand its importance the most. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them in these discussions. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, the stage rich in dreams. Our most vivid and emotionally powerful dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests dreams have a purpose. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research on the brain did not support this idea. The study of dreams shifted to focus more on their physical origins rather than psychological ones. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than people at his sleep center. He concluded that dream use increases with a person's interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams since films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Doesn't everyone – like teachers, software designers, and politicians – need to think creatively? Dreams, according to Stickgold, help us combine things in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They 'ignore the obvious and put together things that make a kind of unexpected sense ... This is what creativity is,' says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to give some kind of fluency, fuel for thought. On those days, words and images come so quickly that my fingers can barely keep up. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we deal with relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, which has a beautiful sea view, there are empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading figure in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate the richness of early-20th century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Despite her talent, she doesn't keep any of her own work. 'As soon as I finish them, they go,' she says. Susie is in high demand. Over her 30-year career as a copyist artist, she has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts sometimes mistake them for the originals. While the originals could sell for millions, her reproductions sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie keeps her clients' names private, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, but status is often important. One celebrity likes to show off his 'Van Gogh' painting, which is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh.' 'Many famous people pass off my copies as originals,' she says. 'That's their choice.' Some collectors save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank and displaying Susie's copy. Susie is honest about her work. She makes her reproductions look as authentic as possible, believing that doing a poor job would disrespect the original artist. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as an original is illegal, and although she knows people who have done it, she has never been tempted. People who make fakes often get into trouble. Susie isn't wealthy and has faced difficulties, but her situation is more stable now, and risking her reputation doesn't make sense. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, earning very little. It was good training for her current work and gave her a love for plants, but it was hard to live on. She had to be very precise and get things right the first time. She has no regrets but is glad she found something more financially rewarding. When young artists ask for advice, Susie stresses the importance of learning to draw accurately. She also highlights how much she has studied to achieve her skills. Her training allows her to do anything from drawing plants to making perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces to reproducing 20th-century abstract art. She now focuses on French impressionists, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas as her favorites. Susie says people often think modern art is easy, almost like children's work. Impressionists painted quickly and freely, but they were also very careful, which is hard to do well. Given her skills, it's surprising that Susie doesn't create her own original art. Isn't art about self-expression? And could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She says her work is the result of years of training and practice, and she earns a good living from it. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs—good, but not exceptional. Perhaps it's like living on simple food after enjoying meals by a top chef. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing days, nothing was more important to Ellen MacArthur than the sea, except maybe being the fastest on it. She was obsessed with sailing from a young age. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a non-stop, solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and workspace for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even down to the number of kitchen paper rolls she needed. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly showed her stock of freeze-dried food, the small gas stove, and the neatly organized medical supplies and rations. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, she sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. She realized things she hadn't considered before. Seeing abandoned whaling stations felt like a warning. ""It seemed like we just took what we wanted and moved on. That's what we do,"" she said. When I visited Ellen's office, she had just finished a heated conference call. She explained why we must act now to save the planet. ""No one is making coal, oil, or gas anymore. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find a way not to use them up. At first, my message was negative – use less – but then I saw another way."" Now she focuses on re-using, talking passionately about things like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says. ""But I love learning. [The current situation] became something I couldn't ignore. Sailing seemed selfish in comparison. This is different. It's about finding how my voice can be most useful. It really matters.""

She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It is part of who I am. You are so connected to everything around you. You don't have time to feel lonely. You focus on the record, on practical things, on survival. [My new] message will never be as simple as saying: 'I'm going to be the fastest person around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this is more important than anything I've ever done."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his time. As many young people spend more time on computers and video games, he hopes to inspire them to climb their own mountains or at least spend more time outside. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero,' and climbing Everest is just part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest points on each continent. Few people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he turns twenty.

I have talked to several experienced Everest climbers, and none of them think taking a 13-year-old up the world’s highest mountain is a good idea. They agree that a young climber might be physically strong enough, but they doubt if a teenager is emotionally ready. They also question if a young person has enough experience to make the good decisions needed for such a dangerous climb. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. ‘I know that criticism is out there,’ Paul says, ‘but I can’t waste my time with it – there’s still so much to do. I think about possible problems, obviously. Karen and I weigh up the risks all the time, but we believe our own experience as climbers will help. And watching Jordan develop gives me confidence. He’s becoming so strong and grown-up.’

I also wonder about Jordan’s motivation. Is this just an ambitious father pushing his own love of adventure too far? ‘This project isn’t about me trying to become famous for my son’s achievements,’ Paul insists. ‘At first, he talked about it as something to do later in life, but when we discussed it, we thought: ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn’t lost the motivation to do it.’ When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ‘I just focus on achieving my goal.’

In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting challenge. The more exciting the record, the more interest it gets. This gives Jordan a problem. We may complain that achievement often replaces enjoyment in these challenges, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to engage with the media. This means blogging, doing photo shoots, and giving interviews. He has to offer something spectacular, like climbing Everest. ‘And you know what?’ Paul says. ‘If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he’s done with mountain climbing and wants to play basketball instead, we’ll shut this whole project down and go to the gym.’"
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it’s likely they’re not listening to classical music. Most of us can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won’t know who he is. I’ve just started a music degree, but even my classmates don’t know much about classical music. If you don’t know who composed the music, you probably don’t own any recordings of it. The statistics are discouraging for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find that hard to believe. So, why has interest in this centuries-old music declined? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who often go to classical concerts, but they are few. Although I’m a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not a big classical music fan. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably close to that 3% figure. So why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are challenging for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Experts say we struggle to focus for more than about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more appealing than a long classical piece without lyrics. Classical music is powerful, but it doesn’t cover issues that interest teenagers. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families made music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but our lives rarely include classical music. When did you last hear classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says classical concert audiences have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many of those new audience members are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don’t know why people like classical concerts more in middle age, but I know that if your parents love something, you might avoid it. Some say schools are to blame for teenagers’ lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are eager to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They like classical music when they perform, but it’s not their first choice for listening. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we choose pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too, but she didn’t hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t mind if she had heard because her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among trees on a hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be thrown out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and went towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. Bonnie treated horses well. The horses were well cared for, she noticed immediately. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. He seemed lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They can’t be far."" The room with the riding equipment was – to Bonnie’s delight – unlocked. Focused on putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she saw. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m not joking, because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, a breeze brushing her cheek and making it glow. She felt Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he’d jump well."
43,"Cody Simpson is a 15-year-old Australian who has become famous for his music. He has released several successful songs. But how did a relaxed surfer become a star on stage? Cody explains, ""I started playing guitar at six and writing songs at seven. But I was also swimming and surfing every day. Those activities were more important to me back then. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted some videos online."" These videos changed his life. He first posted a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans loved it and asked for more videos on social media. Cody, who had recorded more songs at home, was happy to share them. The response was huge.

Cody was also a talented swimmer, training with top coaches. But when record labels showed interest, he faced a tough decision: stay in Australia and continue swimming or take a risk by signing a music deal and moving to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the chance. ""It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine deciding your future at 12 or 13?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I'm kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked reactions. ""I'm very modest, and I think it's important to stay that way in this crazy world.""

Cody moved with his family to the US, leaving one dream to pursue another. Although his family stays out of the spotlight, they support him from the background. Cody believes it's important to have a close group of supportive people around you. He admits, ""Sometimes I worry about how my decision affects my little brother and sister. My brother is eight and travels the world, doing school on the road; he doesn't have a regular life. But my family always reassures me that they support and encourage me.""

Success in any career comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to opportunities, even when it's scary. ""Everything happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, I'm visiting countries I never thought I'd see and performing for thousands of fans. It's something many people dream of, but I know it won't last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, lifted a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the wall of sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I worked with most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing I could do it. Not that my grandfather noticed much. With one hand still on the curtain, I looked along the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the wood processing factory in Milltown. With fragile ice on either side, the dark open patch was followed by solid ice downstream. As I took off my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. A boy I didn’t know. I frowned. Unbelievably, he was trying to balance on an ice shelf along the water warmed by the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and reached for my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there – a silver chain my famous grandfather once brought back from a trip to South America. Better than having a famous grandfather is having this chain, which only he, my mom, and I know about. Plus, I have the diary he kept on that journey. I keep it under my pillow and read parts of it before I fall asleep. I patted the chain again and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled at me as I grabbed a banana from the kitchen counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful, now.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I headed down the hallway, almost bumping into Grandpa as he stepped out of his bedroom. ‘Can’t you watch where you’re going?’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going, anyway?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ As if my wetsuit didn’t make that obvious. As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s getting harder for me to do that lately. ‘What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. For a moment, his sharp words hurt just as he intended. But I took a deep breath and silently counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door shut. Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself at the moment,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say that he’d always been that way. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero – from the time he first showed me photos of him in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang framed on his bedroom wall, above his dusty expedition medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe someday, my own face in National Geographic. And yet, a part of me still wants to stay devoted to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep it up, even on these cold days!’ I smiled back at her as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Text: Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly Grandpa's work, but different from anything he had done before, and it was not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a river that took up most of the scene; it wasn't a river she knew and maybe not even a real one, just a fantasy river. The picture was strange and shapeless – and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was almost invisible, just a hint of green that the eye barely noticed, being drawn into the pale waters and towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, no birds, no people; and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice – something too casual, too detached – that showed her excitement. And Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others make sense of them, if they could. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written there. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed to have a strange importance, as if they were somehow meaningful to her, but she didn't know why. And there was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn’t it – I mean, for him to be so specific. Still, he hasn’t finished it yet, so maybe he’s going to add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn’t resist. It’s such an unusual picture, especially having a name. I suppose you can guess his response."" Jess didn’t need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it’s not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and its own language, just like a poem, and we either understand it or we don’t. And he said painting’s hard enough work as it is without having to waste time telling every idiot …"" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what the thing means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone who came along, they’d never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted her, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa had often used it when she watched him paint, but usually, it was just to say that the muse wasn’t being kind to him today, or that he’d have to be nice to the muse today as he had a difficult part to work on, or something like that. He’d never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human being at all. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, having any influence over someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn’t need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He’s been painting all his life."""
46,"Text: 'When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have gone into the carpet and cut a big piece out of it. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. All I'm saying is, I didn't mean to damage the carpet. I didn't wake up thinking, 'Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.' It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Then later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm very unlucky that way. What I was actually doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute! Very small and painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in there: shepherdesses, milkmaids, and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me! But the thing is, it is a corner cabinet. That's why it's shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom. This is because it's the smallest room in the house, under the roof, and shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the one the size of a broom cupboard is mine. Mum says that when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems I'll be in my broom cupboard for years. I don't really mind; I quite like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the way the roof slopes down, and the window is at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That's when it came to me. If I couldn't cut anything off Gran's cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It just seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be quite pleased with me. He is always telling us to 'think outside the box'. And that was exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly 'borrow' things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not a human one, which made filming more complex. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres to get the Borrowers' perspective. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh. In the story, there's a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn't have to act. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn't sit during breaks and had to be sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don't think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers' home was shot with actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren't accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn't allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work fast – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully conveyed the magic of the books."
48,"Text: 'Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren’t there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the ""can-you-get-me-free-tickets-to-your-dad’s-concerts?"" ‘Everything’s going to be fine,’ I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me with this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. To leave my old life on the road and with tutors. So while the rest of the band is renting here during the recording, we’re staying for good. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet real kids. Like a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so normal. I walk into the school’s main office. ‘Hi, I need my schedule please,’ I tell the school secretary. ‘Name?’ She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ‘Desert McGraw.’ ‘Desirée?’ she asks, leaning closer. ‘Desert,’ I repeat. The secretary seems confused. ‘Oh,’ she says and types ‘McGraw’ on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad uses his stage name. ‘What grade?’ ‘Eleventh.’ ‘One second, it’s printing,’ the secretary says. Then she hands me the sheet. English Literature, first period. Cool, I like that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, so I wouldn’t look lost. When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already calling names. ‘Aurelio Gonzalez.’ ‘Here.’ She continues while I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes look at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! ‘Nice shoes,’ she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. Dead giveaway. ‘Thanks,’ I say. The teacher pauses. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says hesitantly. ‘Here.’ The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she actually gives us time to talk! All teachers should do this. ‘So why’d you move here?’ my new friend asks. I have lots of choices here. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ‘We need a change, Desert,’ he said, ‘and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.’ Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they pick South Beach Sounds, a studio near the sand? ‘My dad had to relocate,’ I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ‘What does he do?’ she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. ‘He’s an artist,’ I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. ‘Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.’ And she doesn’t seem to care. Excellent.'"
49,"Text: 'Today, the average American teenage girl is expected to be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what being an American teenager is like now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and stay unnoticed because being average is not enough anymore. Mediocrity is not acceptable, and not having big ambitions is seen as laziness. ""People, often adults, forget how much pressure teenagers have these days. We have lots of homework, tests, extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life,"" says teenager Kristen Loose. Despite these pressures being normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes about them still exist, often spread by the media. You know the ones: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. While there is some evidence of these traits, putting the whole generation in this category is not fair, some say. ""Many people think we spend most of our time watching TV and using our cell phones,"" Loose says. Loose believes this is mostly wrong. She admits to keeping her cellphone close most of the day, but not just for fun. It's not just for texting friends; it's a tool that teens use to make their lives - and the lives of those responsible for them - easier. Students today are expected to have immediate access to the world and be reachable at all times, which can look like a cell phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work with them and do homework anywhere. Instead of listening to music on the way to school, they could be listening to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate but need 24-hour attention from already busy teens. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. Their schedule is full of school, after-school activities, family duties, and homework. Then, they have to get up and do it all again the next day, with less than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation surveyed American teenagers and found that about 20 percent get the recommended nine hours of sleep. Moreover, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are sleep-deprived. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all her activities, she gets about 18 hours of free time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is not much. Olsen rarely spends those hours on social media or TV. Instead, she focuses on volunteer work. ""I think the stereotype of teenagers is that they only care about themselves and their own interests,"" Olsen says. Despite this image, Olsen says her favorite part of the week is volunteering. ""I love helping others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community during the week."" In 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but they will still be proving it wrong and pushing the world forward. There will be another generation of students who are changing the world, all before they finish school.'"
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth's surface. It's a science project with a twist: part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or metal piece enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by an enthusiast from a nearby state, inflates the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chant, and the balloon rises. Some run and track its path with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There is quiet and a sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside and look at the clear sky, hard to believe it's just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I watch a boy climb into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure decreases, and the balloon expands until it pops. A parachute helps the equipment land safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who notes they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is becoming familiar with this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘It's important to remember that these students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What may seem wild and dangerous to some is simply a way of life to others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. It’s a bit disappointing, but it’s also a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountain ridges. And it’s one more adventure story to share with others."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. Her interest began by chance. 'My younger brother was really into dinosaurs, a phase many kids go through, but I hadn't. I helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in the field. It amazed me, and I knew I wanted to pursue it,' she says. I wonder what support she received since Palaeontology wasn't a common career choice for young people then. 'I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,' she laughs. 'Matt Cornelius was already famous, even though he was young. I was nervous, worried he'd think I was just a kid bothering him with questions. But he was patient and willing to listen, which made me feel more comfortable,' Chloe explains.

I ask her about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV. Chloe frowns. 'Movies like Jurassic Park have increased interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. While I appreciate the interest, the few palaeontologists shown in films are often stereotypes. We're either seen as eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks, which isn't accurate. Films don't show the reality of our work,' she says. I ask her to elaborate. 'My job is very varied. I dig up dinosaur bones, spend time in labs analyzing fossils, and write for scientific publications.' Although it's not a daily task, Chloe also communicates scientific findings to the public when possible. She takes this role seriously. 'There are many misunderstandings about science. Some colleagues avoid this challenge to focus on research, but I think it's important. I like reaching out to young people to show them all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs can excite them about the natural world and help them understand other scientific ideas.'

The TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a chance for Chloe to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She notes that the program's creators knew their stuff, and she was there to advise if needed. 'I didn't have much to correct, just small things like the size or shape of dinosaurs, and ensuring they existed in the same time period. We attracted audiences of all ages because we've learned so much about dinosaurs recently. The ones in this program are very different from those in movies like Jurassic Park. They're the most life-like ever shown,' she says.

Why does Chloe think dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain a research focus? 'I think they appeal to the explorer in all of us. We are drawn to the unknown and the idea of discovery. In a world that feels smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us there's still more to discover. Palaeontology is like time travel,' she concludes."
52,"Text: 'I’m just going to say this once: when you’re traveling by car with your family, even if you’re six years old, you probably know you’re not ‘there yet,’ even as you keep asking ‘Are we there yet?’ And anyway, once you get there, it’s not ‘there’ anymore, is it? It’s ‘here’. So if you think you might be ‘there,’ you should ask ‘Are we here yet?’ And I’m sure no one wants to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear that question over and over during long car trips. I mean, really – what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather be relaxing in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs you haven’t seen before, listen to music, or do puzzles you’ve had for a long time, while the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, there’s mum or dad, who gives out juice boxes and cookies, or changes the radio station and temperature to whatever you want – basically, they keep everything running smoothly like a concierge! Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying – usually my younger brother, Tim. Like putting his foot on my side of the seat. What? He can’t do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it’s his other foot, and then a hand, and soon he’s in my space and we start fighting. The driver and co-pilot reach back to separate us as the car speeds up and swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a while. And the beautiful scenery, full of history, continues to pass by. Soon after, I’m trying to read, and I feel something – a breeze on my arm. But the car’s not going fast and the window’s not open. So where’s it coming from? My brother is in the next seat, quietly blowing air onto me. He’s on his side, not touching me – so he’s found a loophole. Just breathing? What’s the problem with that? The anger rises. Tim gets yelled at, there’s more swerving. Then slowly the chaos calms down again – for now. Over the years, Dad has developed ways to deal with us kids in the back seat. For example, when we ask ‘Are we there yet?’ he often says, ‘Yup. We’re here. Get out of the car.’ ‘But Dad. We’re still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour.’ ‘Oh, well, then maybe we’re not there yet.’ That kept us quiet for a while. You can tell when you’re finally ‘there’ when you see the adults get out of the car and go as far away as they can from the kids who have annoyed them for hours. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You’re not there yet.'"
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope customers will love the experience and return. Zuzi explains their motivation: ""With so much technology, everyone is busy on their phones. We wanted to bring people together without screens. It's natural for us to communicate with each other.""

The games in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone involved until the end. This idea was improved in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. Pandemic, a Eurogame by North American designer Matt Leacock, is about solving global problems together. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He recalls, ""When I played that with friends, we felt scared. There were highs and lows, and everyone felt good, win or lose. I wanted to create something like that.""

Leacock's love for board games started in childhood. He was often disappointed by games, so with his uncle's help, he redesigned them. Pandemic became very successful, and its sequel added more storytelling. Leacock says, ""It's like an electronic game where you develop characters, get new rules, and the world changes. It's an unfolding story.""

The growth of video games has surprisingly helped board games become popular. Video games have made playing games normal. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, says, ""Everyone with a smartphone has at least one game they like. More people are open to playing games now.""

Video games once offered social interaction in arcades or with friends at home. But as online multiplayer games grew, players became physically separated. Some people who enjoyed video games started looking for games to play with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, games are something to share in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with setbacks. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and taught him to play the guitar. Growing up, he only listened to a local radio station for middle-aged people, which influenced him. He was 12 when he first heard a contemporary song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. Although he was good at tennis, he realized it wasn't what he wanted to do for life because it was too much hard work.

At 17, Jamie left school to pursue a music career. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to be a musician, explaining that he wrote lyrics during economics lessons and played the piano daily. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Jamie found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he switched to another label to release a new album, but fame and fortune didn't come. He feels he was often in the wrong place at the wrong time as an artist, but as a writer, he was in the right place. Writing for others became his strength. He believes he is one of the main writers in the UK, helping new artists start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that aiming for chart success is okay. He asks them, ""Don't you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?"" He believes in writing songs that are both amazing and likely to sell well.

Jamie speaks openly about wanting to write hit songs that reach number one. He is not arrogant; he simply knows he has a talent for writing hits. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goal. When he works in the studio, he aims to write the best music of the next year, not just what's trendy. He wants to create classic modern pop songs."
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity: a big star online but probably unknown to people who don’t watch online videos of bike stunts. He is a ‘street trials cyclist’ - he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I interview him, we meet in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys know who he is, and we stop a few times as older people come to tell him he’s ‘an absolute legend’. After seeing his skills, I agree. Even though I was doubtful at first, I’m impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and I can’t always believe he’ll succeed. But when I praise him, he seems uninterested. Despite his online fame, Tony says he’s a reluctant celebrity. ‘I find the social side hard. I see the value of connecting with fans, but I prefer doing things rather than talking about them.’ This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. ‘This technology lets people like me make a living,’ he says. ‘Sometimes I feel everyone is focused on cameras or screens, and part of me doesn’t like that.’ However, he’s not complaining. Through his videos, he earns well from what would have been just a hobby in the past. I’ve learned from interviewing top athletes that two important factors turn a keen child into a top competitor: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These may be more important than talent and help in persisting despite failure. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength is needed. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on what were easy but new obstacles for him. He just got up and kept trying until he succeeded. Tony isn’t always seen as a hero. Some say he’s reckless and takes unnecessary risks. He says, ‘Those who say this may be concerned but don’t know much. They probably haven’t ridden a trials bike and don’t understand the sport. They don’t know the technical details and don’t realize I get expert advice to minimize risks.’ Tony is careful about the risks he takes. ‘People are different. Some never get scared and shouldn’t do these sports; it’s wise to know the dangers. The rest of us are either unable to overcome fear or can. I’m in the group that feels fear but finds a way past it. I’m not addicted to risk and spend hours planning. Sometimes I ride around to get in the right mindset before a new stunt. I know I mustn’t lose my nerve before I jump. If I fully commit, then I’m fine.’"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many dangerous challenges for charity, like running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she already had some circus skills, she quickly found out that high-wire walking was very different. ""The training was a shock,"" said Helen. ""I didn’t realize how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour after my day practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!"" On the day of the actual challenge, it was windy, and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she admitted afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" The experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old-style bicycle with one large and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked on building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it for a holiday trip to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. A serious fever left him in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for hospital bills or the journey home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using an exciting tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but nothing about their night activities because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope will give us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about how to protect their habitat. The work is very hard. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but more often it is wet. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we will look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from the company I work for. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I keep my colleagues happy by giving them samples! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm at our food lab, and other times I'm traveling to buy raw materials. Since I have a young family, traveling can be hard. But I love the variety and lack of routine in this job, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! People often ask if I get bored of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt like I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more in the evening!'"
60,"Text: 'Have you ever wondered what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. In the year-long course, students slowly increase the risk they take in each class, and parents come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s important to keep performances fresh and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is planning for the future because you can only be on the road while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also includes business planning. Many former students start businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a job for making money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!”'"
61,"Text: 'You may not know her name or her face, but you’ve probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren’t good enough to be lead singers. That’s not true – they have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! ‘What I love about my job is that when I walk into the recording studio, I never know what I’ll be asked to sing,’ she says. ‘It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I’m often surprised by producers’ requests. I was once asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue, I just do the job!’ ‘Excellent musical abilities are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There’s often no printed music to look at. I’ll never forget my first experience of recording the background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra as well. I was terrified: I knew that if I got something wrong, it would mean recording everything again, which nobody enjoys. Recording sessions are long enough as they are.’ ‘One of my favourite jobs is doing recordings for songwriters. Less experienced writers don’t always understand which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it.’"
62,"Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge of fashion and created a successful business with her 'satchels'—a traditional bag used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops worldwide and are popular with many celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie considered various business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning, instead of just going with her first thought. Once she chose satchels, not everyone agreed with her decision. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She involved her family from the beginning, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design inspiration came from children's storybooks. Although Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they have been important to her success. Initially, she sold about one satchel a week. To generate interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would mention them in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed at which her company produces the satchels. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied Julie's design to sell similar products. As a result, she now ensures she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices—people love working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people doubt if celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it for their own fame, which hides the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Her parents were not musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. But Ana says the teacher didn’t listen to her, so she wrote Something to Say about how this made her feel. She posted the song online, and it became very popular. She was happy when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the words each time they listened. Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, she was unsure because she didn’t know the company and didn’t want someone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her this wouldn’t happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. They sold all the tickets quickly, and it was an amazing evening. Ana says she prefers writing songs about difficult times because there is more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes fans will like her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that matter to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I joined a guided group tour by boat along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I also knew our great-grandparents had lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally said yes!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to visit. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to prepare, but Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people lived along that coast, and indeed, the only other living creatures we saw on the first morning were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop worrying about time. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like stress-free living!

When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss my family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many games would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I’d like to train with the basketball team. Even though I enjoyed the training session, I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I did. It took me some time to agree, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it turned out fine in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy my first experience of living far from my parents. At home, I couldn’t spend much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part didn’t change much for me. I got used to my new life eventually, and my English improved quickly too!

I turned professional at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to fix that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I chose to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I found out that to get a licence, I needed to know a lot more than I had learned. Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group. You also need to be entertaining, tell interesting stories, and handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour without hearing about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might post a negative review online. Good reviews are important because they attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy usually result in very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, there was no need to worry.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so gathering this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meal made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By the light of the moon, we led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. That was our choice because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn’t include meat, which we both prefer to avoid. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day—I certainly will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people for their friends or homes; many different customers want flowers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo sessions. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of it. My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often colder and darker than I'd like, but that's normal at that time, so I don't mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I'd probably only get pink ones because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what others want aren't always the same. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can't find what customers want. I don't enjoy arguing about prices with the flower-sellers, but it's part of the job. Flowers aren't cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we make flower arrangements and calculate the cost of orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy figuring out how to create the best flower arrangements for the money someone wants to spend. That's what you have to do when you're selling things – I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to just cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. The website has been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve visited to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed."
71,"Text: 'Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I was 15, I felt that to improve my hobby, I needed to do something special. So, I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I started. After a few weeks, I decided to upload these photos to a website for young photographers because I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was surprised to find that some people liked how I saw and photographed things. I also enjoyed taking photos of different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be better – and I agreed. So, I focused more on taking photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. Many of them were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing – they were taking color photos. As a result, I sometimes doubted my project and almost gave up several times. In the end, I trusted my own feelings and became more confident about my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. So, I entered some of my photos for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized that maybe my photography was good, and that I might be able to work as a professional photographer. I now have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.'"
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I knew they did activities like camping, sailing, and public speaking, which I had never tried before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was quite shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me continue volunteering at the club because I had made great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to going.

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before starting at the club, and the idea of youth work had never crossed my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I’ve earned several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was so young that I hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After that, I quickly developed a love for the sport and improved my skills. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored of snowboarding, but my love for competing and winning has grown stronger as I’ve gotten older. This helps me push myself harder. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That achievement made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and my studies because there’s no snow. Although I train every day, it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends then. It’s the best way to cope with not being able to do what I love and am really good at. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering becoming a doctor if my active life allows time for college. It’s hard to imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I can’t snowboard my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a valuable lesson from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it much. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I found it easier than I expected, even though it looked complicated when I watched Mum. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery pieces to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. I needed to know if they were good enough for the public, so I rented a market stall with my mum. There are many tourists where I live, and they bought a lot of my jewellery to take home as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country were calling to buy more. They thought we were a big company with many employees, but it was just my mum and me at a market stall! That’s when I knew it could work, and it was time to create a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It’s been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s own life. In an interview about her book, Janine said, ""Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, fits into a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that."" Janine started her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always dreamed of becoming a published author, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to spend her time writing. The year before, she had entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people there were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was on sale in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia mentions that, even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the characters in the story actually face some difficult challenges, and this makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a very long novel, she has shown that she’s a better writer than several other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is spend time with my friends for a while, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! It all began when my father was asked to be the castle's manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was happy because he thought he might not get such a great opportunity again, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very lively in summer because it attracts lots of visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island, which often involves a lot of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day back to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days when there are huge waves – but the ferries don't run then! And I've found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I'm always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, though, it's so foggy that you can't see anything, then within hours, it's brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it's been here for centuries – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I am close to achieving that because on family holidays abroad, I have had the chance to see birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I might see my 200th species. I was not too disappointed when it did not happen, as I have learned that you need to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it and commented that it looked like an interesting hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching to the school. I did not feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I would remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I had prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it does not have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. However, my family knew I often got interested in new hobbies and then stopped them, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. In fact, I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. And the chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a talented player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know that young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club when I was just 13 years old. After that, I improved a lot. Despite this, people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. As usual, despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach’s voice cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. Fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football and to have a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will let them see the professional environment and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team if they’re ready to work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in higher education in the UK and around the world in recent years is encouraging new students to get involved in research early in their studies. This idea is based on the belief that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making big discoveries, but it is a natural and important way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your job, as they help you think about the world and do your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You don't just learn and repeat it; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions instead of accepting things as they are. You might ask: Why? How? When? What does this mean? How could this be done differently? How does it work in another situation? What do we really think about the facts, views, or beliefs we are given? Why is it important? These are common questions in research. Research can range from very complex and groundbreaking work done by highly trained people to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about issues, practices, and events. Most students have been researchers in some way. You have done research for school projects or at work since you started studying. You have asked questions that led to investigations and research since you first became interested in learning. You have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, choosing a music system, or shopping online. In college and higher education, having a curious mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas, and creating your own responses and knowledge are expected learning activities. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and authorities, and you might feel you need to be told what is important to learn. However, in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem daunting. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research of others is useful to students, academics, and in the workplace, but we need to do more than just repeat what we read. We need to engage with it, think about it, test it, and decide if what we are told is logical, reasoned, and supported by evidence. We should not blindly accept facts and information given to us by others."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London gathered in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities can inspire creativity, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. Although city life is known to be tiring, new research shows that it can also reduce our ability to think clearly. One major reason is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for the brain. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they offer a mental break from the busy city life.

This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we are in crowded urban areas, surrounded by many strangers. These unnatural environments affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy city street requires our brains to manage many things: distracted people, dangerous crossings, and the complex city layout. These tasks drain our mental energy because they force us to constantly focus and refocus our attention. The brain is like a powerful computer, but paying attention uses a lot of its power. In contrast, natural settings do not require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Natural environments capture our attention without causing negative emotions, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.

Before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to include nature in urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer a break from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While people have tried many ways to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or changing office designs, few are as effective as a walk in nature. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain centers of intellectual life. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that cause attention and memory problems, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities drives creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a hub of new ideas, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of technological innovation. Less crowded cities may produce less innovation over time. The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people feel, ""I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city!"""
81,"Text: 'Where should we look for the mind? This might seem like a strange question: surely, thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain-scanning techniques to show this. While it seems natural to think of the mind as being inside the head, I believe we shouldn't limit the study of the mind to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as neurons, are part of human thinking. From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have played a role in human evolution and the development of the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might still be part of the mind. It is easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually have around them. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limits of brain-scanning machines. But this often means we overlook that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I am not questioning the brain's role in thinking, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It would be useful to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also looks at how these processes have changed over time and what that means for how we think. This approach gives us new insights into what minds are by changing what we know about how objects affect the mind. Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick helps us see minds and objects as connected. It also shows how flexible the human mind is: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick plays an active role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can change deeply by using new technologies. My approach sees the human mind as always evolving. It is important to remember that, whatever form the 'stick' has taken in our history—from early stone tools to the internet—its main role is as a pathway, not a boundary. Through the 'stick', humans explore and understand the world, but also create new paths forward. That is why a stick used by a monkey to get food is different. For humans, 'sticks' are used to satisfy our curiosity. This unique human tendency to engage with objects explains why we, more than any other species, make things, and how those things, in return, shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world. I want to include materiality in understanding the mind. MET offers a new way to understand how different forms of material culture, from stone tools to smartphones, have helped define and transform what we are and how we think. Mind-changing technology sounds futuristic, but humans have used it since they first evolved.'"
82,"Photography is one of the few inventions that have greatly changed civilization and how we understand the world. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became a part of American culture at all levels. It influenced practical and scientific fields, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians argue that photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. No other art form has been as significant in the US. This claim shows how photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discussions. To fully appreciate its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century.

Why was photography so attractive? First, because it was a mechanical process, it matched the growing interest in technology in the US, where change was seen as a normal part of life. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with amazing immediacy. Second, the camera was the preferred tool for representing oneself in a country where personal and national identities were always being created and recreated. Third, the camera was important for creating and keeping a family record, even if it was somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs matched the American artists' tendency towards realism and depicting everyday life.

A photograph draws attention to something, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Every picture says, ""This, you should see!"" Because a photograph is made by a machine, it has a unique quality: it records events, people, and things, showing what was in front of the camera. This gives photographs a certain objectivity. However, since a photograph is taken by an individual, it also has a personal point of view, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, but photographic meaning is more complex. No image is presented without some context that affects our understanding, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery.

To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and role in its cultural context: Why did the photographer take it? How was it first seen? The same image might be seen in different places and times, and its meaning can change accordingly. The camera's importance to artists was once a secret, but now it is well-known. For several decades, starting with US artist Andy Warhol, artists have used photographs in their work in various ways. Photographic vision has become an essential part of art, not opposed to painting, but as an important addition to it, shaping our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea of what this means. However, even though we can study this concept in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains somewhat difficult to fully understand. James, like most psychologists, was especially interested in human psychology. He believed it included basic elements: thoughts and feelings, a physical world in time and space, and a way of knowing about these things. For each person, this knowledge is mainly personal and private. It comes from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and may or may not be influenced by scientific facts. Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological matters based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex psychological topics, like whether brainwashing works, or when we state our opinions as facts about why people behave in certain ways, such as feeling insulted, unhappy, or suddenly quitting their jobs. Problems arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to provide methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in a given situation, or to determine when each explanation applies. Psychologists help us distinguish between thoughts that are subjective and possibly biased, and scientific facts. Psychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind or brain. Although psychologists study the brain, they do not fully understand how it works in relation to our hopes, fears, and wishes, or our behavior in different situations, like giving birth or watching a football match. It is often not possible to study the brain directly. So, psychologists learn more by studying behavior and using observations to form ideas about what is happening inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not directly observable like an engine's. In everyday life, they can only be seen indirectly and must be inferred from behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, involving evaluating and interpreting clues. These clues come from careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical analysis that can be publicly reviewed. Complex interactions are common in psychology, and understanding them requires advanced techniques and theories. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or change the processes it studies. Once these goals are achieved, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply conclusions to people's lives. Psychological findings have been useful in areas like teaching children to read, designing safer machine controls, and helping emotionally distressed people communicate better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been scientifically studied in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or reflecting on one's own conscious experience, to answer psychological questions. These early studies aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today. However, introspection has clear limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of automatic brain work. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than on personal reflections."
84,"Text: 'In a storage facility in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays products that were removed from sale because very few people wanted to buy them. You can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola there. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business. You might think that companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but the executives who visit the museum show that this is not common. They often avoid thinking about their failures and do not keep samples of their unsuccessful products. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, wanted to create a 'reference library' of consumer products, not just failures. Since the 1960s, he collected samples of every new product he could find. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection mostly consists of unsuccessful ones. Today's culture of optimism might explain why these products ended up in the museum. Each product likely passed through meetings where no one realized it would fail. Even if they did, marketers might have invested more money to force some sales and save face. Little effort is made to understand what went wrong, and people involved often avoid discussing it. This focus on optimism is common in the growing 'self-help' field. A popular method is 'positive visualization': imagining things going well makes them more likely to happen, or so it is believed. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot has found evidence that our minds may be wired to see the chances of success as higher than they are. Her research suggests that well-balanced people are often overly optimistic about their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression. But how effective are 'positive fantasies about the future'? Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her team have studied this question. Their findings show that thinking about how well things could go can actually reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people encouraged to imagine a successful week at work ended up achieving less. Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our beliefs about ability affect how we experience failure. People with a 'fixed theory' mindset think ability is innate, while those with an 'incremental theory' believe it develops through effort and challenges. Fixed-theory people see failure as proof they lack ability, like a sports star who thinks of himself as a 'natural' but doesn't practice enough. Incremental-theory people view failure as a sign they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight-training: muscles grow by being pushed to their limits, tearing and healing stronger. Having an incremental outlook is a happier way to live, whether or not it leads to success.'"
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have a big advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many of us think we know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many theories about home advantage. On the other hand, people who invest money in sports wonder why home advantage still matters. If players are paid well, shouldn't they play well anywhere? 

What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who think their team needs their passion and support. Fans often believe that when they cheer, their team scores. But they forget the times when cheering didn't lead to a goal. 

However, one thing fans believe is supported by science. Home fans often try to influence the referee. In a famous experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This matched the actual decisions made during the game. Researchers think referees avoid extra stress by not making calls against the home team. 

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar. Yet, these changes don't fully explain the data. 

Home advantage varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. One reason might be that home advantage is more about team spirit, and baseball focuses more on individual players. In team sports like basketball, success depends on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home. 

Another possibility is related to players' testosterone levels. Studies show these levels are higher before home games, suggesting a natural urge to defend home territory. In the recent Rugby World Cup, underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, 'It’s the law of the jungle out there.''"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous in sports and valued by athletes and coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with claims for other golfers of that time. Its meaning is also puzzling. Player didn't mean actual luck; he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ But how much better can one get? This question is central to the nature-nurture debate in sports: is talent something you are born with or something you develop? However, calling it a debate might be misleading, as nurture seems to have won. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent in sports, music, business, or anything else is largely due to psychologist Anders Ericsson. He is known for the theory that becoming an expert in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has been popularized by Malcolm Gladwell’s book ""Outliers"" and others like ""Talent Is Overrated"" and ""Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice."" These books generally conclude that practice is what matters most, suggesting that 10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert. But, as Epstein argues in his engaging book, this is often not the case. He points out a flaw in studies on excellence: they focus on successful people. Science is better at explaining why an elite athlete succeeds after the fact. Are there other ways to understand why some people have certain abilities while others don't? Epstein explores this question by traveling from Kenya to Sweden, the Caribbean to the Arctic, and even beyond human achievements. In Alaska, he learns that the key to winning the toughest sled dog race might be the husky dogs’ drive, hinting at a mix of genes and 'voluntary' traits. Some interpretations of the 10,000-hours rule assume that commitment and determination are choices. But what if, as the huskies suggest, drive also has a genetic part? These examples show the complexity of the topic. Epstein talks about hardware (nature) and software (nurture) and agrees that, for elite athletes, both are needed. He doesn't ignore the importance of training or environment, suggesting that if Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. But Epstein also looks at cases where genes are so important that they can't be ignored. He also examines race and gender issues. For gender, he asks: ‘If only practice hours matter, why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?’ Sometimes the best questions are the simplest."""
87,"Text: 'A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main problem. This idea matches other discussions about modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children to understand their unhappiness better. It found that many children would be happier if they could play outside more. Many people over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, talking about the freedom they had to explore, swim, and build dens. They think this was healthier than the protected life children have now. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have created this protective environment for their children, worrying about risks. Griffiths’ book includes strong arguments. She discusses the fear of outdoor dangers and how it benefits the toy and gadget industry, which sells products to keep children entertained indoors. She also talks about trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. It’s unclear how common these practices are, but Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly. She is also inspiring when discussing childhood freedoms and rules. However, Griffiths sometimes takes her ideas too far and ignores important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children. She mostly sees them in an idealized way, which might not match the reality of dealing with lively young children. She suggests that children are ‘musicians of thought’, but this might not be true for all kids. The book’s main theme is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children learn to manage risk by experiencing small accidents. However, she doesn’t explain how to ensure these accidents are ‘the right size’. Also, not all children may want the adventurous life Griffiths describes. What about the quiet, cautious children? Perhaps the real mistake is forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside.'"
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my schooling. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play. Those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how mammals, including humans, have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, and moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems, not just follow instructions or do routine calculations. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate problems, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creativity, which comes from a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play'. He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is the ability to get along with others, care for them, and cooperate. Children are naturally driven to play with others, which helps them learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit if they want. This makes play democratic because players must keep each other happy to continue. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults feel they must intervene rather than let children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, warnings from experts, less cohesive neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children need more play, not more school. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They need to follow their natural drive to play and explore to become strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow direct contact with potential employers, similar to standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, this access also increases the chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to use her contacts to find a job. The executive, offended by this request from a stranger, not only rejected him but also sent a harsh rejection note that went viral. Many who saw the note online were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone, though not her message. This incident highlights the risks of using social media for job hunting without proper knowledge. 

Social media can be dangerous for job seekers who misuse it. Ironically, sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of twentysomethings for years. For my generation, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers, a place to impress and experiment. It was often based on fantasy, where you could have long conversations online and ignore the same person at school. You could change your image overnight with a new profile picture or song. But using social media for professional networking is different, and our familiarity with sites like Facebook might be a disadvantage. 

We first gained our online presence by being bold, which might explain why some still think this is effective. Just because many people liked your Facebook posts doesn't mean you can use LinkedIn to impress employers. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn't apply to professional settings. Employers often complain that young job seekers on professional sites are too informal and seem arrogant, reinforcing the stereotype of an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are desperate to find jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can harm their job prospects, even if they have the skills and motivation to succeed.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach increases your chances of a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, generic messages, and keep a humble tone to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it requires careful handling to avoid negative outcomes."
90,"Text: 'Anyone who claims they can predict the future of newspapers is either lying or mistaken. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA says that newspapers are now the main news source for only 26% of US citizens, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people confidently predict that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist said that books and theatre were outdated and that newspapers would become the main form of social life. Yet, theatre survived not only newspapers but also cinema and television. Radio has thrived alongside TV, and cinema has held its ground against videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have made a comeback, with online sales increasing by 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This was partly because producing current news for a large audience became possible and affordable only in the mid-19th century, with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. Equally important was the new idea that everything is constantly changing and we need regular updates – a concept unfamiliar in medieval times and probably to most people in the early modern era. Now, we expect change. To our medieval ancestors, the only certainties were the changing seasons and occasional disasters like famine, flood, or disease, which they couldn't predict. Life, as writer Alain de Botton says, was ‘cyclical’ and ‘the most important truths were recurring’. Journalism as a full-time job barely existed before the 19th century. Even then, there was no clear reason why people needed news regularly. In some ways, the regular publication and fixed format of newspapers were, and still are, a limitation. Online news readers can check news based on how urgent they think it is. Advanced search engines and algorithms let us customize news to our interests. When big stories happen, internet news can provide minute-by-minute updates. Mistakes and wrong ideas can be corrected quickly. There are no space limits for stories, and documents or events mentioned in news can often be fully accessed. This is very different from the fixed format of newspapers. Yet, few online news providers seem to use the new medium to spread understanding and knowledge. Instead, they focus on being first with the news, getting reader comments, and creating noise and confusion. In medieval times, news was often shared in noisy places like markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we seem to be returning to that world. Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction now. Or, as the internet adds to what de Botton calls our feeling of living in a ‘chaotic universe’, newspapers might find that they alone can guide us to wisdom and understanding.'"
91,"If humans were truly comfortable under the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many nocturnal animals do. However, we are creatures of the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genetics, even if we don't often think of ourselves this way. This explains why we have changed the night by filling it with light. This control is similar to damming a river. It has benefits but also consequences, known as light pollution, which scientists are just beginning to study. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, where artificial light shines into the sky instead of focusing downward. This poorly designed lighting brightens the night, changing the light levels and rhythms that many life forms, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects life aspects like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would have been meaningless. Imagine approaching London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's most populous city. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few houses had gas lighting, and public gaslights wouldn't appear for another seven years. From a few miles away, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We've lit up the night as if it were empty, but that's not true. Among mammals alone, many species are nocturnal. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. The effect is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds are 'captured' by searchlights on land or gas flares on marine oil platforms, circling until they drop. Birds migrating at night may crash into brightly lit tall buildings; young birds on their first journey are especially affected. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours due to artificial light. It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need an undisturbed view of the night sky for work, but like most creatures, we need darkness. Ignoring darkness is pointless. It is as important for our health as light; changing our internal clock can cause health problems. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping is a biological expression of Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so essential that disturbing them is like changing our center of gravity. In the end, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs near a bright highway. Living in our own glare, we have disconnected from our evolutionary and cultural heritage—the stars and the day-night rhythms. Light pollution makes us lose sight of our true place in the universe, forgetting our scale, best understood under a deep night sky with the Milky Way overhead."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently announced that his company will stop tracking employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by his media team. Ignoring the way the announcement was made, we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn't harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work better. The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team are up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much you prepare, there is always work waiting when you return. This is the nature of taking leave; work piles up, and you can't control it. Someone following these rules might not take leave at all or feel guilty about it. Guilt can lead to stress, and not taking enough leave can reduce productivity over time. There could also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is off and for how long. This pressure already affects when people start and end their workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotions. If the security of guaranteed leave is removed, people might feel they can't take the leave they need, fearing they look lazy. They would lose their legal right to fall back on. The policy might make workers feel unable to take leave or they might stick to their legal rights, making the policy pointless. Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, blurring the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours accurately, why use an old standard for time off? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being watched, making them self-monitor, which could be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits like increased morale, creativity, and productivity from unlimited leave can exist without affecting worker well-being. I doubt that ""being able to take as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"**Simplified Text:**

Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field review a scientific paper before it is published. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research, preventing flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often reassure the public about its importance. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trust in published research? The answer is both yes and no. Examining these issues shows that scientific publishing is changing. 

I am not ready to give up on journal-based peer review. I believe papers should still be checked before formal publication, but I see changes happening. The rise of preprints, which are drafts of papers posted online without peer review, is a key part of this change. Preprints allow for the quick sharing of new results so they can be read, critiqued, and built upon. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which affects both authors and reviewers. Competition for spots in top journals pushes scientists to do their best work, but it also encourages cutting corners, as stories without inconvenient data are more likely to be published. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is suitable for a journal based on its newsworthiness, not just its scientific quality.

These issues are known, but few are willing to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a big change from the norm. Preprints have been around for twenty years but are not widely used. This slow adoption is partly due to scientists' conservative nature and the misconception that journals won't accept papers posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review will lead to 'junk science,' but this hasn't happened yet. Authors know that preprints are open to critique by a global community.

Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience: 'My paper critiqued a published paper, which is difficult in traditional journals. With anonymous peer review, the original authors might block a critical paper, or they might not be chosen as reviewers and could complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their points. All comments are public, so readers can judge the arguments' quality. Even if journals reject our paper, the preprint and comments are still available, so our work isn't wasted.'

Preprint archives allow global scientific discussions that used to be private. They can also share negative results, an important part of science often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing their effectiveness in sharing research. By using the web's openness and the collaborative spirit in science, preprints can help focus on the work itself, not just where it is published."
94,"Text: 'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it’s like ‘a painting in words’. These answers don’t satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist would, and another from the object’s point of view, calling it ‘Poem.’ Here’s what one student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and only for a short time. Most people will never need me. The item? An oxygen mask – a surprising choice that helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to fun and useful discussions. When I was in school, poetry didn’t make much sense to me. I saw every poem as a confusing puzzle that blocked true understanding and feeling. After school, poetry often becomes something people care about less and less. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it’s not like regular writing. It almost challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down by its simplicity or because it’s hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we hope to find in poems? Aren’t they supposed to hold deep feelings, beautiful images, tender thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels offer worlds to escape to, paintings give us visual pleasure, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. However, one thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life – unlike reading sentence by sentence – is full of it. But these thoughts still don’t tell us what a poem really is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it leads to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of literary art using the beauty and rhythm of language like sound symbolism, etc.’ This is fine academic language, but it hides the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable, unpredictable – or to machines – carefully made and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t hold up when looked at closely. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It can help the mind explore new ways of thinking and see common things differently. The poem as a mental object is not hard to imagine, especially if we think about how song lyrics can stick in our heads. The mix of words and melody has a strong effect, like schoolyard rhymes such as ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a newspaper or magazine page, looking right at you: A poem can hit home like nothing else, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten just like an article, story, or novel, but it never really becomes what they usually are – something made to be sold. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry collections, but few expect a collection to pay for its printing costs. A poem presents itself not as something for the market, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special place – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment.'"
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been wiser to spend it on something for the house. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has made me happy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. But since it was raining, I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It's the most famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a beautiful necklace of gold and silver, with a gold ring at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I called, ‘I've got something for you.’ Still looking at my find, I heard her come in and stop. ‘What is it?’ she asked. I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been burgled, but I was anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I placed the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc has been more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People say, ‘Now that you've found something so amazing, are you going to stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing—not while there's a chance of catching a bigger fish tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When friends tell me about their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian beds? Better sleep is a happy side effect of travel. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and dream more than I thought possible. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I don't think just relaxing explains why travel sleep feels so different. I believe sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. We take in new cultures, music, landscapes, and even ways of moving. It's during sleep that we process all this new information. No wonder sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with each place. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep patterns. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, the conversation slowed, and everyone started napping on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is also memorable. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my dreams. If 'slow travel'—enjoying every moment rather than rushing—is what modern travelers aim for, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said to her customer with practiced politeness. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking a bit like a bulldog. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said firmly, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and she was looking forward to seeing Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing. They knew nothing about this friend, as her husband Jeff had quickly pointed out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff had said when Mia told him, ""What kind of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" ""Sounds pretentious,"" Jeff retorted. Her husband didn't like anything showy or pretentious. He also didn't believe in ""beating around the bush,"" as he called Mia’s hesitation to speak her mind. He wouldn’t have held back with the woman in the shop: he would have told her she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said a trash can lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and entered the back door of Medlar House: her commute from work was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia had the idea to convert the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think there's a demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends who struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions that there was definitely a demand. She was right. From the start, after Jen helped her create a website for the business, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham, where in a relaxed and welcoming environment, they could try on as many hats as they needed to find the right one. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits so nothing was left to chance. She recently expanded her services to include handbags and costume jewelry as well."
98,"It's a long way from London to Atlanta, and in his new American home, Lawrence Okoye reflects on his incredible sports journey. He is confident, but even he is surprised by how far he has come—from competing in an Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Despite never having played American football before, Lawrence is likely to be chosen by one of the top teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still learning the details of his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be selected for a top American sports team is surprising. But Lawrence is used to overcoming doubts. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but delayed it to focus on discus, after playing rugby. Within 20 months, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, aiming for the world championships. When asked about his sudden interest in a big NFL contract, Lawrence says, ""American football was in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I had thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then."" Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, did he think he could be chosen? ""Pretty much,"" Lawrence says. ""I applied online."" Was he nervous about competing with experienced players? ""No,"" he says. ""I don’t get nervous for many things."" He is not very talkative, but he believes in his abilities. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ""I was very pleased to hear that,"" he says, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is cautious. Lawrence has no basic experience in American football. How can he make it into an NFL team? ""Coaches say I have the right attributes. It’s about how hard I work,"" he replies. Will he stay calm while waiting to hear if he’s selected? ""I will be. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I’ll be selected, but I’m not too worried."" This calmness might come from his Olympic experience, where he finished last in the discus final. He seems to have moved past this and is happy he made it to the final with an impressive last throw. ""That was an amazing day,"" he says. ""The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sport. I can return to it."" After his Olympic disappointment, some thought the event had affected him. Lawrence doesn’t comment on this. An NFL player’s minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his physical talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on one sport? ""I understand why someone would say that,"" he responds. ""I’m trying to achieve something I dreamed of as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought through."""
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, winter had not yet started in Siberia. I saw no sign of human life, just an endless view of mountains, streams, and forests. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow flying to a remote area to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with a one-way ticket because I planned to return to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and said ""Holodna"" (cold) while pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had warm clothes, though I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I wasn't sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking about a dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still learning to manage my classes, the job was good for me. It was challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and there were long holidays for adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Since that first ride, Al had been setting himself bigger challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was his biggest so far. At times, he thought the ride or the road would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong those who said he couldn't do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through a series of pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to take part. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was in good health, and the second that I would empty all my pockets, because small objects can become dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I needed to stay oriented. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" I was told, ""the pilot will explain which direction to look."" I was also asked to promise that when flying upside down, I would ""completely relax. Try and enjoy the view."" Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing where I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were moving down the runway, my legs were up in front of me, feet trying not to touch the important steering pedals, and hands trying not to rest on any of the many important switches within reach. My mind was made up. Ignoring all instructions, I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To survive without passing out, you have to stay calm and focused. You need to tense up at the right time and relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. None of this was comforting as we began accelerating down the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway. We were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the world’s fastest acrobatic planes, ready to go. The plane took off and two seconds later we turned sharply to the right. It was a sudden, strong move and I felt the air squeeze out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed everything, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned sharply left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, aiming for the small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my moment of excitement was interrupted by a sharp right turn. We hadn’t even done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, my hand shaking so much that the plane shook too—it’s that responsive. Then Dario said something. I asked, ""Can you repeat that?"" Instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" ""Yup."" ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane up and over, making a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was a bit much. At the top of the loop, as we were flying upside down, I heard a small voice shouting, ""Relax, relax, look up."" Then I looked up and saw some fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been ""soft"" compared to what the pilots endure when they race. To show this, Dario got out some sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily ate. I didn’t eat for hours, and that night I dreamed of doing the loop the loop over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you’ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it’s probably been filmed by him. His ideal temperature, he says, is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about surviving in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting supplies on the way. This meant swimming through extremely cold waters and facing frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers are confident and driven people, and they need to be. This time, however, there is much more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important to scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. This is a job he was trained for. As a child, Pen was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to toughen him up by sending him out into blizzards and icy winds with as few clothes as possible. His father passed on a love of frozen adventures, and Pen showed unusual physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and shares his love of the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he’s at home: ‘He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic.’ For fun, she once competed against him in a famous mountain event where riders on horseback race against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour ahead of Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he admits. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I thought it would be a good idea to say to my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He took it very seriously, asking his mum how she was all the time, but it became too much for him. While it was well-intentioned, it was unfair.’ For similar reasons, he plans to have very little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending these last days before leaving preparing his equipment, obsessively. ‘Out on the ice, you can hardly fix things or do anything that isn’t very simple,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, one of the world’s top polar explorers, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will be supported by a team of six, flying in supplies. Being part of a team is actually more stressful for someone like him, says Pen, and something else is on his mind too. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done far less training than I’m comfortable with.’ Why? ‘Organisational things always seem more urgent. So I’m almost fearful of what I’m going to ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that inspired past generations to explore the unknown. ‘Reaching the North Pole was ultimately a personal goal,’ he admits, ‘and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re creating a platform to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and nobody can do it but us,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which are otherwise unusual and not needed in society, have become very relevant. Suddenly, we’re useful again.’"
103,"Text: I had a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Although these activities were great, there wasn't anything competitive for me to focus on. I knew I wanted to stay in shape, so I could try for an Olympic spot if I wanted to. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I have always loved rowing; the way the boat moves through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn't ready to train seven days a week. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I talked to some rowing friends about joining the race; they weren't interested. I knew if I entered, even though it's mainly an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance to win? No. But part of me liked the idea of being an underdog with no pressure. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We talked about the remaining costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Besides the cost, I also had to consider the loss of earnings from being away. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It's nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I wouldn't just talk about the past. I'd be doing something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My Olympic preparation was tough, my life focused on getting in the best shape; but looking back, it was straightforward. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the program was set, with doctors and dieticians. I was worried about people's reactions to me racing with a TV presenter. I was concerned it would look like I just wanted to be on TV, otherwise, I would have chosen a better partner to win the race. My concerns disappeared during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more than just rowing. It's about the mind. Ben had completed the tough Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and a year on a deserted island. But he couldn't row. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest with Ben about the improvements he needed. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty spaces, maybe as a reaction to the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to over 100. Recently, they took over a second property – the 'wilderness farm’, which they said was a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I stare at a page with over 100 pictures of huskies; I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, a wave of opening flowers and leaves. But I think I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forest – thin conifers, heavy with snow – stopping sometimes to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely through the door when I’m given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the sound of barking, which becomes a wall of noise by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth up the lines of huskies, pulling them out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, pulling against the ropes in their eagerness to go. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to stop and talk much anyway. I stand on the sidelines and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command rings out, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light. November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a discouraging questioning about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m stumped. I don’t know. Am I? Further questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in sub-zero conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around myself by overenthusiastic huskies. But I am triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Curious journalists asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended it to help heal Radcliffe's injuries from a training accident when she ran into a bike. Radcliffe says the achievement never really felt real to her. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal at the time. However, she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. She and her team had decided not to set any limits. Their motto was: no limits. During the race, Gary Lough, Radcliffe's husband and coach, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Next to him was Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent wondered if she could keep up the pace. He worried it might make her drop out of the race. Hartmann was angry at this, but admitted that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe started to calculate. She realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast, but still managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster than that,’ she says. ‘I remember the race director, Dave Bedford, saying he never thought anyone would come close to that time for a while. And I was thinking, “I'm going to come back and do it next year.” I really thought I would.’ Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. After the race, everyone wanted to know how an athlete with such an awkward style had beaten the graceful East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks, giving her daily sessions to help with the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He says, ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists and no one could take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. I had to go so deep into her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterwards because I was in such pain.’ Hartmann describes traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no: ‘Hello Gerard, do you want a cup of tea?’ ‘I’d barely got in the door and she was waiting for me to do a two-hour session … Paula would get every last bit out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that time, Hartmann gave so much attention to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I did train really hard, but there are people out there who are more talented. I thought it was going to happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never easing up, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me to it because I never thought, “I can relax now,” it was always: “keep pushing as hard as you can.” Radcliffe didn’t know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run as fast again. However, she left a lasting legacy. Many women were inspired to start long-distance running."
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I didn't know how viewers and the press would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our series was a new and exciting part of that, but I still worried: would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ‘Perfection’, each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often very physical, with travel and exploration. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who creates a golden pasta that tastes better than any other. These people have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is, of course, very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was left out. I could imagine people asking, ‘Where’s steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?’ But after long discussions, the TV team and I came up with a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book’s title, I knew from the start that I wouldn’t claim the recipes were ‘definitive’. But I thought that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines ‘perfection’ as being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying ideas and changing them until you have something unique. The TV series let me explore foods, people, and places I’d never seen before, and I was excited about that as much as exploring memory and nostalgia in food because I started in this business the same way. Finding the best ingredients for the recipes took me around the world. Among my adventures were: being taken to a canning factory that was processing the wrong type of tomato, and visiting a dairy farm with such low standards that we had to stop filming! Refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine, and nearly burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza.'"
107,"Text: 'We were still hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets and a serious look on his face. ‘Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,’ he said finally, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field stretched as far as I could see. There was nothing much in it, just grass and a lot of flowers. Poppies and daisies. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I repeated, because it was always safest to agree with Bea. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat on the side of the road and watched John get smaller and smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay down next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’ So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them all the things the birds talked about. Breadcrumbs. Other birds. The weather. I told them about the argument they had over a worm. ‘That’s silly, no one understands bird language,’ Bea said. My eyes stung. ‘I do.’ But my voice didn’t sound very convincing. ‘Liar.’ I blushed. How could I be lying if I remembered every single word? The more I thought about it, the more I wasn’t sure. ‘Mum…?’ But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea refused to get out. The boys didn’t seem to mind at all. They waved and smiled at her through the windows in the back door. We followed John into the tiled café. It was set back from the road and was not far from where our van was now parked. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘I think it might be a bit expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum reassured him, and we sat down in the shade of the terrace. The tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very, very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ‘It’s like syrup in there,’ she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. ‘I suppose it’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said when it began to get dark. Mum took blankets out onto the road. She made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to go to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ‘I’ll have to have us towed into Marrakech,’ John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later we were sitting in the truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John at the wheel. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck himself. Now she sat in the front with the man who was driving. I kept wondering how we’d get home again now that our van had to be dragged everywhere. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.'"
108,"Lucy was at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her: one was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, whose name was Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing, their recent travels, and future plans. 

‘I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,’ Lucy told them. It sounded impressive, even though she didn't really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She often did things she didn't want to, like concerts and competitions that took her around the world. She missed so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore and studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco instead. Lucy hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group worldwide. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. Lucy hadn't applied herself; her mom had sent in the application and CD. ‘I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,’ her mom said. Lucy thought it was more about not giving her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn't think about trying to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward, surprised. ‘Tanglewood?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘How old are you?’ ‘Fifteen.’ He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ‘Wow.’ Lucy didn’t mean to brag. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was too much. ‘It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying...’ Liesel/Louisa excused herself, seeing someone else she needed to talk to. Tokyo stayed. ‘Have you ever been to Japan?’ He had long, shaggy hair, like many musician guys, to show they were cool music nerds. ‘Once. When I was, like, eight.’ He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ‘Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.’ He took her arm and led her away. ‘And don't get too friendly with the competition.’ ‘They're not the competition.’ ‘Everyone is the competition.’ Her grandfather took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, only half-listening. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’ She liked that part—being somebody. Even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her any special respect from her school friends. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. He’s hard to argue with, so I decided to see what experts say – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is a key part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just use media for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do – they live in it. It’s not about whether it’s good or bad – it’s about how you use it.’ How does our social networking compare with what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at the youth club, as today’s parents did when they were younger, to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. He says it helps teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and get along with their peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity: you can post about your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see that other people have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He says that using social media can help if you’re shy: ‘Communicating online can be more comfortable than face-to-face, and it can help you practice social skills in a less scary environment.’ Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help if you’re quiet and have a special interest because they let you connect with others who like the same things. ‘If you’re one of only three people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people who like the same thing, you can still be popular, just in a different way,’ he says. Pauline White, a digital education expert, told me something interesting: ‘It’s people your age who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people, and create their own content who are really using social networks well.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasting, and blogging about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites, she says, are changing creativity. Keen photographers can connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interest. ‘This all adds to employability and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness – and you need to understand how it works to create customers. For example, if you develop a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they’re all potential customers. If you link all those networks, there’s your customer base.’ Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age.’"""
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first thing they imagine. However, my parents had a different idea for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to plan what many teenagers would consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" my parents kept saying before the trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There must be good reasons why!"" Mid-June came, and we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough room left for us in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our spacious home for smaller accommodations over the next five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into. We headed straight west, through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had our share of adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under some of the darkest, star-filled skies in the country, but only after almost being blown off the highway in a dust storm. We quickly learned the rule of the road: cattle have the right-of-way! The next day, we were up at dawn and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. Climbing to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dodging construction traffic became normal. Disappointment turned to laughter as we posed by the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" managed by park volunteers, were expected as traffic stopped to let bears cross. Our own close encounter with a bear on the road (and a worried park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its problems, couldn't dampen our spirits. It was a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service, but it offered the most amazing views I've ever seen. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, my family and I headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic foreign place to find something amazing. It was bittersweet to be home again, but at least I hadn't fought with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos of our crazy journey to look through and remember. And I knew that for me, the things I'd remember would be the unplanned, the spontaneous moments.'"
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would spend the next year finishing her final school courses, living under the care of the college Head. It was her last year at school, so moving would have been unfair to her. Amy was happy to have the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. Rose only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose’s parents were not excited about the idea, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and was eager to know her granddaughter again. Rose wasn’t sure why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past, leading to summer holidays spent elsewhere. Rose was only ten when she last saw her grandmother, but her memories were happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and good at bringing people together. Within a week, Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. The thought made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical frail old lady and seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England. Dahlia and Rose had a 'talk' before the move. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But this time, Rose insisted on one thing: she wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would meet all her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, or go out without asking permission every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, Dahlia insisted. Rose was thrilled. They all agreed it would be about trust. Her grandmother would trust her to act maturely and make grown-up decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be overbearing. If either of them went too far, they would renegotiate. Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good, and her exam results were excellent. This worked in her favor. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, form bonds, and basically start her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced at it now. At least she knew this was the last time, as she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new moment in time, a new piece in the mosaic of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. ""I thought writing a book was a big achievement because it seemed so challenging. I didn't know what other teenagers were doing, like being in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought: 'I might as well try this now.'"" The novel Charlotte started then is about to be published. ""I recently told my former teacher about it, and she was surprised. She said she thought I would do it when I was 30 or 40. That idea never occurred to me—I didn't see why I should wait to do something I might be good at.""

It's a winter afternoon at Charlotte's publisher's office. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a great achievement: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of its main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. The book's public relations representative is with us in case Charlotte needs support. But she doesn't need any help. She is independent, with a lively intelligence and a steadiness that keeps her from being overconfident.

Charlotte admits the limits of her youth. I ask her about the complex moral issues she raises. ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. There aren't many life lessons I can give my readers,"" she says, laughing. ""I don't think my understanding of the world is limited by my age, but I don't think I'm particularly wise either. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.""

She has a theory about teenagers and how they are ""betrayed"" by the fiction aimed at them. She says there are three types of teenagers in novels: ""The outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the world, and the awkward teenager who isn't socially skilled."" Reading about these types annoyed her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who aren't inadequate in some way. The impression teenagers can get from some writers is that they can't know who they are because they're not experienced enough. This can undermine their self-belief.""

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and life. I asked myself: do I have to do this to write a good book, and can I really do it?"" However, she praises a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It tells you that if the reader starts to guess what's going to happen, the suspense is probably gone.""

Some might say that Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father's connection with someone in publishing got her book read initially. She acknowledges her luck, as getting a first novel read is hard, no matter the author's age. ""Every aspiring writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their talents, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew into the air, but something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practicing turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it, and I was afraid of being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training center in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students would jump and land in foam pits – not a real introduction to what we’d face on the slopes. After practicing indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the center’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down again. Land in the right zone and you keep moving forward, reducing impact. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why speed is important. At first, it was hard to make my body ignore my brain and go fast towards the jump. My legs would almost stop as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body is doing in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth was as happy as I was, and for a moment I felt proud. But that didn’t last. On the last run of the day, I kept my speed as I approached the jump, landed correctly, but then saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and your nails dig into the harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There's a pause, then a sharp drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, then go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park.

Amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are a huge industry. To create the excitement and escape that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's a real challenge. Designers must create the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe. They also need to add new features to keep visitors interested.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense, but most techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the tracks made by specialist manufacturers.

I spoke to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer,' said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it's about quickly changing between different forces so people feel thrilled but safe. It's a fine line between excitement and discomfort.

To create a great ride, teams must build a strong story, like a space adventure or jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or steepest drops. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, gut instincts, experience, and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that designers need to be thrill-seekers themselves to understand what passengers want and to test rides before they open.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect too much. Virtual reality can add something extra, like painting an old rollercoaster, but the physical ride experience will remain the most important for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating works for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances occasionally. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day,’ she says. As a choreographer, she is like a teacher and enjoys working with young students. ‘A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re willing to take risks. They want success, but they don’t yet fully understand their strengths and weaknesses. This incomplete picture of their skills means they accept even harsh criticism. They might still question what I say sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’ When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There may be music I don’t like, but I still make sure to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. That doesn’t mean starting over with a new piece. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and have the option to switch to different pieces – it would help lift the mood when rehearsals get tough. Unfortunately, I’m always working on big productions – the music is already written by the composer and can’t be changed.’ Miranda doesn’t want to attach herself to one institution. ‘I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. However, I have to remember that all the theatres and schools I work with have methods and styles that are very different from each other. So I have to be ready to change the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than just doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’ We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries in the past that were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really tries to show viewers what life is like inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I smiled in recognition when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s painful to watch but not made up for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication in ballet is underestimated by the public.’ I’m curious to know what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together. Perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can allow you to get away with a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve even been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props is distracting. And that’s disappointing.’ Miranda has done so much work that I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People seem to want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to develop expertise in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, though the time may come when I’m happy to be known for doing one thing. For now, I just want to broaden my horizons.’"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home on your sofa when there’s so much to experience outside? That conversation gave me the idea for my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend of mine was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.'"
117,"Text: 'When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I decided a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although still puzzled, he showed me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we set off, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained a support boat would be with us throughout, and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool, and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I had hoped. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was happy when I finally managed it on my own. The following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew longer, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.'"
118,"Text: 'Being a flight attendant is not easy. But since I started this job, I have traveled everywhere, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, I have a lot of free time, and life is never boring – which makes it a great job for a young person like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, away from my family, so I always flew alone when school started and ended. Feeling lonely, I would ask the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers, and some of them let me. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for something new. There were many young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say – more than just saying I loved to travel, as everyone else would say that too. Instead, I talked about my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job! I’d recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights I get aren’t the main reason. Most airline staff work very hard, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again!'"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Most of the children already know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do have children who miss home at the start of the week. Surprisingly, it's not the really young ones who feel this way the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to call now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days, and at the end of their week's stay, they all thank us because they have had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. We also have parents who call all the time, asking how their child is doing, which is not really necessary. Often their son or daughter is busy, playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back later. We often get a certain type of child coming, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also need to be excellent musicians, opened in London last year. Before that, it ran for five years in the USA, where it was voted ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, doing the show with an all-British cast was challenging. In the UK, there are stricter rules on how many performances young actors can do each week compared to the USA, where they can do more shows. Because of this, twice as many actors were needed in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented UK-based actors, and they’ve just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. Although the theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, it’s been full every night, with everyone wanting to hear the songs that first became popular in America. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons each day at the theatre. While the teacher is great, I miss my old school friends.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre offers special deals on tickets for schools. They absolutely loved it and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play along with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I didn’t know. Jamie helped me with it, and I was very happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s ability and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! While the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they’ve found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show’s on in London for another year, and is well worth seeing.'"
