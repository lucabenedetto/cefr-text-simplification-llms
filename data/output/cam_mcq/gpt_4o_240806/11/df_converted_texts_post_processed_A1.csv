1,C2,"'A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I’m at this place,"" you are telling everyone, even people you don’t know. This made people think that sharing everything online might not be a good idea. The internet lets us share our lives with many people, which can be exciting. We share stories, photos, and more. But sometimes, we realize it can be risky. 
In the early days of the internet, some people learned these lessons first. They shared their lives online and faced problems like losing jobs or friends. These people were called bloggers. One of the first bloggers was Justin Hall. In 1994, he started sharing his life online. He wrote about everything, and many people read his stories. But one day, he had to stop because it caused problems in his personal life. 
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, wrote about her job. Someone at her work saw it and told her bosses. She lost her job but later started writing about her family. Now, she is a successful 'mommy blogger' and earns money from her writing. 
The lesson is: the internet lets us say anything, but we should be careful about what we share.'"
2,C2,"'Some scientists wanted to warn people about a film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we do not understand. Some scientists were not happy with the film. They said it was bad and even dangerous. 
At first, the film seemed normal. Scientists talked about how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then, the film talked about water molecules changing because of thoughts. It showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after happy thoughts and not nice after bad thoughts. Some people found this interesting, but many scientists did not believe it. They wanted real proof, not just pictures.
The film's claims were not strange enough. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is pushed by a force called 'dark energy'. Other discoveries are also amazing. For example, our brains edit our perception of time, and scientists have found where modern humans came from.
Science is not finished. We are still learning new things. Some scientists are trying to create a Theory of Everything to explain all forces and particles in the universe. Many people think the universe is incredible.'"
3,C2,"'Writing novels is hard for me, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, and writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both are important to me. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind moves the leaves. In the garden, flowers bloom, and bees and butterflies come. I like to write both novels and short stories. After I finish a novel, I want to write short stories. After I finish short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write both at the same time. I started writing short stories in 1984. It was difficult at first, but I enjoyed it. My first short story was 'Breaking Waves'. It was in my first short-story book, 'Tales from Abroad'. Short stories are quick to write. It takes me about a week to finish one. Novels take a year or two. Short stories can come from small ideas, like a word or an image. If a short story doesn't work, it's okay. Not every story is perfect. I learn from my mistakes. Short stories help me write better novels. They are like small experiments. My short stories are special to me. They show my feelings, and I like to share them with my readers.'"
4,C2,"'Science is very important. It helps us understand the world and can cure diseases. Science makes life easier but can also be dangerous. It tries to understand small things like ants and big things like the universe. Science changes a lot. New ideas often replace old ones. Scientists sometimes disagree, but this helps science grow. 
In the past, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Now, we know more. Scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein helped us understand more about the world. Science is always learning new things. 
Science is not just for scientists. It affects everyone. It can change how we live and the world around us. We need to know about science to make good choices for the future. Science helps us control nature, but we must be careful. It is important for everyone to understand science because it can change our lives and the world.'"
5,C2,"'Around 2015, big book companies saw that ebook sales stopped growing or went down. This made people question if ebooks would be important in the future. One person in the book business said that ebooks made his company forget how good paper books are. Even though digital and print books can both be in the market, people still ask if ebooks will replace print books. This idea makes us think and talk a lot. Why do we think ebooks and print books are fighting? This is not just about ebooks. It shows how we feel about new things. In the past, people thought new things would end old things. When TV came, people thought radio would end, but radio found new ways to be useful. The idea of books disappearing is not new. In 1894, people thought phonographs would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. Many times, people thought new things like movies, radio, and smartphones would end print books. Some people thought this would be bad for culture, while others thought ebooks were great. We often think about the end of books when new technology comes. This shows our hopes and fears about new things. We feel close to things like books and TVs. When new technology comes, we have to change how we feel about these things. This is why we sometimes miss old things. For example, when the printing press came, people wanted old handwritten books. When movies got sound, people missed silent movies. The same happened with photos and music. E-readers made people like old books more, even their smell. This should make people less worried about print books going away. But the idea of things disappearing will always be interesting. It shows how we feel about change and losing things we love.'"
6,C2,"'Every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how famous people from the past 400 years did their best work. I wanted to know how they found time each day to be creative and productive. I wrote about their daily lives – when they slept, ate, and worked. I hoped to show a new side of their personalities and careers. This book is about how people work, not what they create. It is also personal. I ask questions like: How do you do creative work and earn money? Is it better to work on a project all at once or a little each day? When there is not enough time, do you give up things like sleep or learn to do more in less time? I do not have all the answers, but I give examples of how successful people faced these challenges. The book is called Daily Rituals, but it is really about routines. A routine can help you use your time, willpower, and optimism well. The psychologist William James said good habits can free our minds. Ironically, he was a procrastinator and could not stick to a schedule. I started this book because I was procrastinating. One day, I was at work trying to write a story, but I was wasting time. I am a morning person, focused in the morning but not after lunch. To feel better, I looked up other writers’ schedules online. I found them interesting and thought someone should collect these stories. So, I started a blog called Daily Routines and then wrote this book. The blog was simple; I posted about people’s routines from biographies and articles. For the book, I collected more stories and let people speak for themselves through quotes. I used many sources, and I listed them in the Notes section for more reading.'"
7,C1,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His father said they could not go on holiday to Spain because it was too expensive. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found a fossil called an ammonite* on the beach. He decided he wanted to be a palaeontologist. At university, he learned more about what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was interested in very old fossils, not dinosaurs. He studied small creatures in rocks.
After finishing his studies, Howard worried about getting a job. He knew he was good, but getting a job was not easy. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London. On the day of his interview, the professor who liked another candidate could not come. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, helped Howard get the job. Howard was happy to get the job, even though he later learned why he got it.
Howard liked his job, but sometimes things did not go as planned. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his lecture notes. He had to cancel his lecture. While having coffee, he met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils there. This was a big opportunity for him. He changed his plans to go to Nairobi instead of a conference in Stockholm or a trip to Scotland."
8,C1,"Charles Spence will eat almost anything. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. The larvae look like maggots but taste a bit nutty and floral. Spence and his team study how our senses work together to create the taste of food. This research helps change what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurants. 
Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" has many interesting facts about eating. Did you know the first person to order in a restaurant enjoys their food the most? Or that we eat 35% more with one other person and 75% more with three others? 
Spence's lab in Oxford is simple, with soundproof booths and old equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with chefs who can't pay for research. Much of his work is funded by a big food company. He helps brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. They do it slowly so people don't notice the change. 
Spence met famous chef Heston Blumenthal while working on a project. Together, they created a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"" at Blumenthal's restaurant. Spence found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with food for passengers. 
At home, Spence has fun with food experiments. Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colored lights and sound to see how it changed the taste of drinks. For Spence, home and work are closely connected."
9,C1,"'Our brains are very busy today. We have a lot of information, some true and some not, and we must decide what is important. We also do more things ourselves now. In the past, travel agents booked flights for us, and salespeople helped us in shops. Now, we do these things on our own. We try to do many things at once, like work, family, hobbies, and watching TV. Smartphones help us do this. But there is a problem. We think we can do many things at the same time, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. We switch quickly from one thing to another, and this is not good for us. It makes us less efficient. Multitasking can make us stressed and confused. Our brains like new things, so we get distracted easily. Just having the chance to multitask can make us perform worse. Glenn Wilson, a professor, says that trying to focus while having unread emails can lower our IQ. Russ Poldrack, a scientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV, the information goes to a part of the brain for skills, not facts. Without TV, it goes to a part of the brain that helps us remember better. Making decisions while multitasking is also hard for our brains. Even small decisions use a lot of brain power. We can end up making bad decisions. Many people say email is a big problem because there is too much of it. A scientist's son said his dad just answers emails all day, and the scientist agreed. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do this and do other things too.'"
10,C1,"'In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think these questions were important. Scientists studied animal actions and results, but not their feelings. But now, some scientists are starting to study animal emotions. Books like ""Wild Justice"" and ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"" talk about this. There is a big question: do animals have feelings like humans? Another question is: do animals know right from wrong? In one study, cows opened a gate to get food. The cows that opened the gate themselves were happier than those that needed help. If cows like solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? Some people, like Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, think we should stop eating meat. He says this is a big change, like when slavery ended. Professor Aubrey Manning thinks we should think again about how smart animals are. He says animals have a simpler mind than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail says we should not think animals are like humans. These ideas are hard to agree on because they are not just about science, but also about philosophy. It is hard to know what it is like to be an animal. Dr. Balcombe did a study with birds called starlings. Some birds lived in nice cages, others in bad cages. When given bad food, only the birds in nice cages ate it. Dr. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt sad. He believes we will one day see animals like we see people, with rights. Professor Manning agrees that we are changing how we think about animals. He says it is a difficult topic, and people have strong opinions.'"
11,C1,"'Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or listen to. Adrian West, a research director, says that technology helps us store information but can also change how we think. We see a lot of information, but it can be hard to think clearly. More data does not always mean more knowledge. Reading books has gone down, and some people think this affects critical thinking. Patricia Greenfield, a professor, says that focusing on visual media like TV and video games can make us less good at thinking deeply. Technology affects how we think, but we do not know exactly how. Some video games can help us learn and think better. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and thinking skills. In the digital age, it is important to understand how technology affects our thinking.'"
12,C1,"Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. Before this, he worked in an office but did not like it. He wrote a book about how working with your hands is good. His new book talks about how hard it is to focus today. He noticed this when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. Crawford thinks these ads make it hard for us to think and remember things. We often avoid talking to people because we are tired of interruptions. We use phones and games a lot, which can take over our attention.
Crawford is not alone in worrying about this. Many people feel distracted by emails and phones. Even if a phone is just on the table, it can make us lose focus. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford believes technology makes us focus too much on ourselves. We prefer texting to talking because it feels safer. This can make us lose real connections with people.
Crawford gives an example from his gym. Before, there was one music player for everyone, which sometimes caused disagreements. Now, people use earphones and listen to their own music, making the gym less social. He thinks real connections happen when people work through differences together.
Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we should have rules to reduce noise and distractions in public. Second, we should do activities that make us focus on real things, like cooking or playing sports. These activities help us use our judgment and connect with the world. They make distractions less powerful. It is important to find ways to focus on what matters."
13,C1,"""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often talk about our jobs. I am a philosopher, so it is a bit hard to answer. Saying 'I am a philosopher' can sound strange. People might think philosophers know special truths. This is not true. Philosophers are like everyone else. 
Why do people think philosophers are different? One reason is that philosophers think a lot about life. A Greek philosopher, Aristotle, said thinking about life is very good. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said we should think about our lives. This helps us make good choices. But you do not need to read many books to think about life. You just need to look at your daily life and see what is important.
Philosophy is sometimes seen as far from real life. This is because philosophers often write for other experts. They do not always share their ideas with everyone. This makes philosophy seem hard to understand. 
I work in ethics, a part of philosophy about right and wrong. People often think ethics is about rules and laws. But it is more than that. For example, we can talk about if downloading movies illegally is wrong. Then, we can think about responsibility and art. Philosophy helps us look closely at our actions and beliefs. This is good for everyone."""
14,C1,"'People who love food think about what and how we eat. In history, talking about food was often about other things, like learning. Sometimes, people talk about food, but they mean something else. Epicurus, a Greek philosopher, talked about pleasure and avoiding pain. Today, his name is linked to enjoying food and drink. We see his name in restaurants and food shops. Food is social and cultural. It comes from history and we share it with others. We eat with friends and family. Food is important, so people talk and write about it. Some people are good at describing food tastes. We often talk about how things look or sound, but not how food tastes. Some say food should be part of art, like music or painting. But food is eaten, so it does not last like a painting or a song. There are questions about what we should eat, like organic or vegetarian. These choices show our beliefs. Cooking at home is different from cooking in restaurants. At home, we cook for love and friendship. In restaurants, cooks work for their boss and the food. Food can help people from different cultures come together. We can learn about others by eating their food. Eating together helps us make friends from other cultures. This is important in international meetings. A recent essay talks about how food can connect people with fun stories and examples.'"
15,C1,"'Rob Daviau is from the US. He makes special board games called ‘legacy’ games. When he was a child, he played many board games. But he thought they were not fun or hard enough. So, he wanted to change them. He asked, ""Can board games have a story? Can choices in one game affect the next game?"" He changed a board game called Risk to make Risk Legacy. In this game, choices change the game forever. Players might tear cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules. The game is played over many sessions, and players remember past actions. Daviau also worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a game where players stop diseases. His next game was SeaFall. Pandemic Legacy was very popular, but SeaFall was a big test because it was a new game. In SeaFall, players are sailors exploring new lands. Making legacy games is hard. Designers must think about all player choices. They use testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga tested SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it breaks, and they must fix it. People did not think legacy games would be very popular. Daviau thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved them. He thinks they are exciting and new. Ben Hogg, another fan, likes the adventure in legacy games. He says it is like watching a new movie. Legacy games are like video games and TV shows with episodes. Daviau wanted to write for TV but became a game designer. He likes telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock says making a legacy game is like writing a book. You need to know the start and end. Daviau is happy to see others use his idea. But he thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works with SeaFall, thinks legacy games change how we see board games.'"
16,C1,"'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online. People like stories about animals escaping, like rats and llamas, because it makes us think animals are like us. Octopuses are very smart. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor. Some people think it is not scientific to say animals are like humans. But Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas, says it is wrong to ignore the human-like traits of animals. He calls this 'anthropodenial.' Animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand others' motives. In the past, people thought animals were smart. In medieval times, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, who created the theory of evolution, said the difference between humans and animals is not big. In the 20th century, people started to see animals as machines that respond to rewards and punishments. But now, we are learning more about animal intelligence. Dr. de Waal says we should test animals based on their own skills. For example, squirrels are good at remembering where they hide nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, Sy Montgomery says if an octopus tested humans, it might think we are not smart because we cannot change our skin color. Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean. But he knows that stories like Inky's help people appreciate animal intelligence. He did an experiment with monkeys to show they can feel envy. Monkeys given cucumbers got upset when others got grapes, which they liked more. A video of this experiment convinced many people. This shows how our minds work.'"
17,C1,"'Robots were once only in stories, but now they are real and changing the world. Robots have been used in car factories for many years. Now, experts say robots will soon be used in many more places. Many people think robots will do most jobs in 50 years, but they also think their own jobs are safe. This is not true. All jobs will change because of robots. For example, an Australian company made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. In San Francisco, a robot named Tally helps in supermarkets by checking if goods are on the shelves. Robots cannot fix or program themselves yet, so new jobs will be for people who can do this. But some people worry that robots will take away jobs that need people skills. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang studies how robots change work. He says that soon, robots will work better with people. In a few years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer. Salaries in robotics will go up, but there will not be enough skilled workers. Dr. Zhang says people need to learn new skills because they cannot do the same job forever. New robots will also be in our homes and will be more like people. This is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. With many jobs changing, education is important to prepare for the future. We need more people to study science, technology, engineering, and maths, or STEM, to stay competitive.'"
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous climber, was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He said, ""Because it's there."" People often wonder why anyone would do something so dangerous. Some think climbing is about adventure and fun. 
In 1967, a writer named Tejada-Flores wrote about different types of climbing. He said there are seven kinds of climbing, each with its own rules. Over time, this idea became popular in the climbing world.
Many climbers love the feeling of freedom when they climb. But sometimes, climbing can feel limiting, like when stuck in a tent during a storm. This is a bit of a puzzle, but some say the simple life of a climber is a kind of freedom.
Joe Fitschen, a US climber, thinks we should ask, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is in our nature. We like challenges, even if they are risky.
Brian Treanor, a US academic, says climbing can teach us important things like courage and respect for nature. He thinks these are important in today's world.
Some climbers, like Ebert and Robinson, believe climbing without help is more special. They think it deserves more praise because it is harder and riskier.
Climbing can also be like meditation. It helps people focus and find peace, similar to Zen philosophy. This is another reason why people might love climbing."
19,B2,"'For over 60 years, Alfred Brendel was a very important pianist in classical music. He was a serious man who played and recorded many famous European piano pieces. He wrote and played a lot, but he did not teach much. People who knew him well saw he could be fun, but he was serious in concerts. He worked hard, always studying, traveling, and performing. 
Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not think about teaching him. He had few students before and did not plan to start now. He said, ‘You don’t need a mountain guide to teach a child to walk.’ But something about Kit, who was 14 then, made Brendel listen to him play. Kit played very well and from memory. He gave Brendel a CD of a concert he did, and Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit’s playing was special and rare.
Now, as Brendel is retiring, Kit is becoming known. Brendel is careful, worried Kit might get tired too soon. Kit, now 19, is always busy. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, and plays tennis. His mother is always with him. Kit also writes music. Brendel says this is important. Writing music helps you read music better. Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. He listens to his own playing and to Brendel’s advice. He understands and can do what Brendel suggests.
Brendel is careful not to raise expectations. He does not like when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century. It is not good to say that. Kit plays some things very well, but he needs more time and experience for others. Critics should not expect perfection.
At 80 years old, Brendel is relaxed. He says, ‘When I was young, I did not want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. When I was 50, I did most of them, but I wanted to do more, so I continued. Now, I do not have the strength to play, but I still think about music. I don’t play now, but it’s a nice new life.’'"
20,B2,"'When I was little, I thought gardens were special places. My grandad's garden was by a river, not in a city. You could hear the water and birds. I thought all gardens were like this – peaceful and quiet. Grandad's garden was simple. He didn't have a greenhouse, but some neighbors did. They made them from old windows.
At home, my dad was quiet. He liked funny things and had special phrases. He left school without finishing and became a plumber. He didn't love plumbing. He and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but they didn't. My dad was good at fixing things at home, like making bookshelves.
My parents moved house only once. My mom liked to change furniture. One day, we got a piano. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. It had two brass candlesticks, but my mom took them away. My sister got piano lessons, not me. My mom said I wouldn't have practiced.
I liked going to the river. I would take a fishing net and look for fish. I tried to keep them at home, but it didn't work, so I put them back in the river.
I wanted to leave school early. One day, my dad said there was a job for an apprentice gardener. He thought I might like it. My dad didn't like gardening, but he saw I did. I think he hoped it would be good for me.'"
21,B2,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his island, the Isle of Muck, in Scotland. The wind is very strong, but he feels at home. His sheepdog, Tie, is with him. Lawrence shows me the islands around us. He points and says, ""That island is Eigg. The one next to it is the Isle of Rum. It rains more there than here."" I see rain on Rum's mountains. ""Beyond Rum is the island of Soay,"" he adds.
Lawrence has to move his sheep, so we walk down the hill. He tells me about the island. Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide. The geese eat a lot of grass. The MacEwen family has lived here for 3000 years. As we move the sheep, Tie, the dog, makes a mistake. Lawrence says, ""Away to me, Tie,"" but Tie doesn't listen. Lawrence is not happy.
The Isle of Muck is run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son, Colin, takes care of the cottages. Their daughter, Mary, and her husband, Toby, run the island hotel. Mary and Toby like that their children can play freely on the island.
Life on the island has challenges. Electricity is not always on. My first night, I wait for the lights. In the morning, Mary makes breakfast with a torch. There is no mobile phone service, but you can get it on the hill. Most people stop using their phones after a few days.
The boat brings groceries and musicians to the island. They play music in the tearoom, and everyone enjoys it. That night, Lawrence tells me how he met Jenny. Her father bought a farm on the Isle of Soay without seeing it. Jenny went to manage it, even though she only had typing skills.
It rains a lot, but the food is good. Mary sends me to get fresh fish from Sandy Mathers. We eat the fish for dinner, and it is very tasty. The next morning, I wait for the ferry to leave the island. Many ferries were canceled before because of high seas. If my ferry doesn't come, I will stay on Muck for two more days, which I secretly hope for."
22,B2,"'The video game industry used to be small, with only computer scientists and self-taught people. People thought it was just a hobby for young people. Now, the video game industry is important. It is not easy to work in this industry. Making video games needs many people and a lot of time. It is hard to start, but the industry is growing. Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says it is hard to work in big companies. But the industry needs more game designers. Not just the big bosses, but also people who make small parts of games. How can you work in this industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim says you need to make games. You need to show your work. Game design is not just a job, it is a way of life. Another expert, John Field, says it is not easy. Many people want to work in games, but not many have the skills. You need to be creative and know a lot about technology. Can you do it alone? Maybe, but it is hard. A good course in games can help. Most game designers start as programmers or artists. They like all kinds of entertainment and art. They know games are their future. They are not just fans, they are interested in what games can do. Connections are important too. You need to know people to get ahead. The idea of games being just for kids is old. Now, games are for everyone. Families play together. Phones have many games. John thinks there is a lot of room to grow. Games are for big audiences and can teach us things. There are many opportunities in games.'"
23,B2,"'When I was a child, I always wanted to play football. My dad helped me, but he didn't force me. I had a friend whose dad was very strict. He told my friend, 'You can't do this, you can't do that.' My friend stopped playing football because of this. I am happy my dad was not like that. When I score a goal from far away, people say it's luck, but it's not. I practiced a lot since I was a kid. The best players practice for many years. Sometimes young players bump into each other, but I learned good skills. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning. At school, I played many sports like baseball and basketball. I know school is important, but I only thought about football then. I don't want my son to be like that. We read him books, but he likes to kick them. At the start of my football career, the manager helped young players like me. He didn't make a big deal about it. I scored in the first game, but we lost. A TV presenter said, 'You can't win with kids.' That made us work harder. I trust my family and friends a lot. Having a lot of money can be a problem. People say, 'Why does your mom still work?' I help my parents with money. I paid their house loan and bought them a car. My mom loves her job as a hairdresser. I like to help people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. After I stop playing, I want to take a year off. I want to go skiing, but I can't now because if I get hurt, I can't play football anymore.'"
24,B2,"'We were living at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my dad’s agent in Los Angeles. My dad couldn’t write in Los Angeles, so Sam found us a cheap place to live. Reef Point was quiet in the summer because of sea fogs. People didn’t visit much. The road was not nice, and La Carmella, a nicer place, was close by. Only people with no money or who loved surfing came to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people came. After months alone, we were now surrounded by people. My dad was busy writing a script and didn’t notice me much. I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We didn’t have a dog at first, but Rusty came to us. I gave him water, and he stayed. My dad said, ‘He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and brought me things he found. Sometimes, he brought things that weren’t his, like a sneaker or towel, and I returned them. Rusty liked to swim with me, even though I was faster. We swam that day. My dad went to Los Angeles to give his script. Rusty and I watched surfers. One surfer was very good. She came over and asked why I didn’t surf. I said I had no board or money. She asked if I was British and visiting. I said I lived here. She asked about my dad. I said he wrote a book called Tall as the Morning. She knew it and was interested in me after that.'"
25,B2,"Violet Hetherington was in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to get on the ship, Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late, but this was bad advice. An announcement said there was a problem with the computer system. People were upset because they paid a lot for the trip. Violet wanted to leave. She looked for her phone in her bag, but it was not there. She needed the phone to call the taxi company. Her son Harry always told her to be careful with her phone. She asked a couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message to ask Kristina, her neighbor, to check if the phone was at home. If it was not there, she would have trouble finding numbers she needed in New York. Violet thought, ""Thank goodness,"" but did not tell Harry. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother. Her other son, Daniel, was more like her and might forget to tell Kristina. Finally, the line moved, and Violet gave her travel papers to go on the ship. She did not like the ship's foyer. It looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, and carpets like those in airports. Violet went to the elevators, which had mirrors everywhere. The passengers looked tired and did not want to see themselves. Violet was squeezed in the elevator until she got out on the twelfth floor. Her room had the balcony she wanted. She was ready to complain if it did not. She paid a lot to make sure she could see the sea."
26,B2,"'John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He did not know he was finding the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about Portage Park in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 pictures by Maier, a street photographer. Maloof now has many of Maier’s things: her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, 100,000 negatives, and many movies and tapes. Maloof feels lucky. He said, ‘When I bought this, I did not know what it was.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and lived in France as a child. In 1951, she went back to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was private and always had a camera. She wore big coats, hats, and strong shoes. Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier, said, ‘On her day off, she had her camera and came back late at night. She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theatre and movies. She was not very social but talked to people on the street and recorded them. She loved taking pictures of the world. Rydzon said, ‘She was a true artist and did what she wanted.’ Maier’s work was pure art, not for money. Her pictures often showed women, children, old people, and the poor. Photography expert Larry Silverman said, ‘Vivian’s pictures are interesting. Did she make her own style or copy others?’ Maloof wonders if he will see all the negatives. He did not like photography before Maier’s work. Her pictures inspired him to take his own. He said, ‘Her work is about people and street scenes. It is more important than I thought. We want people to know Vivian Maier’s name and put her in history books.'"
27,B2,"'When a book is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her book. The officer asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for a writer. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are many crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story is very complex. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical book, but found the past gave more chances for problems for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good part. When I ask how it feels to be successful at a young age, she says it is nice because people in her small country feel proud. She says, ‘I got a lot of back pats from other people’s grandmas.’ She adds that it is annoying when people think her book is not serious. She wanted to write the book like a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. It gets faster as it goes. I ask if it matters if readers notice this. She says, ‘I wanted to make a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them.’ Even with its special structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery. She says she didn’t plan the book before writing. ‘I would write myself into a corner, then see how I could get out.’ She also wanted the book to be fun for readers. We talk about her love of TV drama series. I ask if she wants to write for TV. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says. She is very enthusiastic and laughs often. She loves talking about her work and New Zealand. She notices how her imagination changes when she is in a different place. She understands why writers leave New Zealand for busy places. But for now, New Zealand is her home. I hope it gives her ideas for more books.'"
28,B2,"'When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. Now, for 40 years, he has been making guitars by hand. Jonny loves the guitar. He says, ‘How can two pieces of wood make a beautiful sound? Different wood makes different sounds. It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at age eleven. At sixteen, he wanted a bass guitar. ‘Some people get a job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I wanted to make it myself. I learned how different shapes and wood make different sounds.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny made, but he and his brothers also made model boats and planes. ‘My father taught us to use tools,’ he says. Jonny’s bass guitar was good, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a job. He liked painting and sculpture too. After school, he studied architecture at university. ‘Architecture is about design, which I liked,’ he says. But he left the course. ‘I wanted to do something different,’ he says. ‘Guitar-making is like sculpture. You make something people use.’ Jonny has made guitars for a living ever since. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. At first, he sold guitars for the cost of the materials. But as he became known as a good guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, Jonny says he is ‘still scratching a living’. He makes only ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. In the early years, he went to music festivals to show his guitars. He learned how to price them by talking to musicians. Jonny thinks it is easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought only American guitars were good,’ he says. ‘But now UK guitars have a good reputation.’ Jonny says new guitar-makers should take courses, but also learn by trying things. ‘Look at other instruments and try different things,’ he says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you learn by yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’'"
29,B2,"English people often talk about the weather. This is a common way to start a conversation. A famous writer, Dr. Johnson, said, ""When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather."" This is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they find it interesting. But this is not true. The weather in England is not very exciting. There are no big storms like tornadoes or monsoons. 
Some people, like the writer Bill Bryson, say the English weather is boring. Others, like broadcaster Jeremy Paxman, say it is interesting because it is always changing. But the real reason English people talk about the weather is to start a conversation. Saying ""Nice day, isn’t it?"" or ""Ooh, isn’t it cold?"" is just a way to say hello or to fill a silence. 
English people use weather talk in three ways: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or to fill a pause when they don't know what else to say. This makes it seem like they talk about the weather a lot. But really, it is just a way to be friendly and talk to each other."
30,B2,"Alice Leader was in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was telling her class of 12- and 13-year-olds about the Romans building the wall. It is 120 km long and 5 meters high, built about 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip over trips to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built, but Alice felt her answers were not good enough. She could not find a good historical novel about life at the Wall, so she decided to write one herself.
Alice retired from teaching after 31 years and started writing in 2001. She said teaching is like acting, and it is very tiring. Writing is exciting but not as tiring. Her old teaching friends are jealous because she still connects with children through her books. Alice wants her books to be different from other children's books. She says many books for teenagers are about bad experiences or are total fantasy like Harry Potter. Her books are different.
Alice liked teaching English and History together. She loved making bored children interested. She sees writing as a way to keep teaching. She started writing her first novel because her sons were leaving home, and her head teacher suggested a writing course. At first, she did not want to do it, but she had to send a story to join the course. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. The course students liked her story and said she should publish it.
Alice asked for a year off from school to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor. He helped her edit the novel. Alice says they work well together. He helps with sentence structure, and she likes to add more scenes."
31,B2,"'To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to have a special race. The race was between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same place. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. ‘I’m excited,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done this before. The roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold, so I’ll stay warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. He wore winter cycling clothes, while Jonny wore jeans and a sweatshirt. Alistair joked, ‘I’ve seen Jonny drive before, so I’m not sure he will make it. I might stop for a cup of tea on the way.’ The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Fleet Moss, the highest road in Yorkshire. Jonny had no problem with the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill at the start. They shook hands and started the race. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside, while Jonny drove the car on the road. They would see each other again at the finish line. Who would get there first? Jonny had a problem right away. A big tractor came onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he said to the cameraman in his car. ‘If Alistair wins, it’s because of this farmer!’ After the tractor moved, Jonny continued driving. Alistair had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill. Sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. When he reached the top, he could ride fast again. Jonny had another problem. The roads were very narrow and slow. He drove through a small stream on the road. After the last village, he drove fast to the finish line. Neither brother knew where the other was. Jonny drove fast to Fleet Moss, while Alistair rode his bike across the last field and onto the road. Alistair stopped at the finish line and asked, ‘Is he here?’ The crowd said no. Alistair was happy. A few minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said sadly. ‘I’m disappointed.’'"
32,B2,"'When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, it is very quiet. You bounce the ball on the soft grass; you serve it; you hit it and hear your own shot. The grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the quiet crowd make you feel away from the world. The silence helps me play better. I try to think only about the game and the point I am playing. When a point ends, the silence breaks with noise: clapping, cheering, people calling your name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching me. I am very focused. I don’t think about the millions watching me play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me it was the biggest tournament. At 14, I told my friends I would play there and win. Before 2008, I played and lost to Federer twice – in the final the year before and the year before that. Losing in 2006 was not so bad. I was happy to be there at twenty years old. Federer beat me easily because I didn’t believe I could win. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could do better. It was not my skills, but my mind that failed. I cried a lot after that loss. Losing hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, my tough coach, usually does not comfort me. He even criticizes me when I win. But after that loss, he told me not to cry, that there would be more chances. I told him he didn’t understand, that it was my last chance. I know a sports career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important, and I missed a big one in 2007. Toni was right. I had another chance in 2008. I learned from my loss. This time, my mind was strong. I believed I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we did not talk about the match. They knew I was already thinking about it in my mind. Until the match started, that space was mine alone.'"
33,B2,"'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in April 1957. She loved Africa and wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa. She became a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist there. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made Jane famous with articles and TV shows about her work with chimpanzees. She wrote many books, including a popular one called ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which is in 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. She helped us understand chimpanzees better. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. Jane showed that chimpanzees have emotions and social lives like humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is very important for chimpanzee research. Jane's study of chimpanzees in Gombe, Nigeria, is a great scientific achievement. She changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves. Even as a child, Jane was curious. When she was five, she hid in a henhouse for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This curiosity was the start of her career as a biologist.'"
34,B2,"'Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist. She can speak like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a fast-talking alien. Her voices are known from children's TV, cartoons, and health and safety videos. Shirley says, ‘I just did a voiceover about back injuries, so I had to learn how to say many medical words.’ She talks about voiceover work. ‘Many actors think they can do funny voices, and they can,’ she says. ‘But there is more to it. You have to make the script come alive for people who can’t see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they don’t always get the job because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course. She sang jingles for TV ads. One day, a man at the recording studio asked her to try a rabbit voice for a cartoon. She thought it was funny but tried it and got a big part. Shirley found out she could do voices and wanted to do voiceover work. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I played the main character and her brother and mother.’ Female actors often do voices for small boys and girls because their voices are lighter. It is hard to hire child actors, so companies prefer adults. Shirley learned to make different child voices by watching children’s TV. She does many jobs, like educational videos and vacuum cleaner ads. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound happy about things you don’t care about,’ she says. ‘But I learned to smile while talking to make my voice sound happy. Animation work is fun because I work with other actors.’ The competition is tough, and a good showreel is important. ‘It’s worth making a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that help voiceover artists with this.’ She says she succeeded through hard work and talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel or practising voices, it’s about setting goals and not giving up.’ Shirley suggests going to ‘specialist workshops’ for voiceover work. She loves voices and becomes the characters she plays. ‘If I do an American voice, I might speak like that for hours or days,’ she says. ‘My children are used to me talking in different voices.’'"
35,B2,"'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people stop dreaming about these jobs and think about more realistic jobs, like being a lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can make money by drawing doodles like the ones in school notebooks seems silly. But some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school papers, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons. I drew some ideas, and they bought them. In a few months, I was making enough money to live. You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, much money, or even to know how to draw well. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it was that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. Being a cartoonist is hard. You should only try it if you feel you can't do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and gives time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t say no to any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious. What about the business side of being a cartoonist? Many cartoonists used to find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But now, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to make and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than those who are very artistic but not good at business. Some people are afraid others will steal their ideas, even if they have never sold a cartoon. They don’t let others see their work! To protect your work, you can draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular on the internet, it can be a lucky break!'"
36,B2,"'Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house. I decided to throw away an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was black and made in Japan. I usually keep old things, so why did I want to throw it away? I took it to the rubbish dump. A young man saw me and asked, ‘You’re not going to throw that away, are you?’ I said yes, and he asked if he could have it. I said ‘Yes’, and we went our separate ways. Later, I felt sad about what I did. A few months ago, I got an email from a man named Keith Rushton. He said, ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’ The guitar was sold many times, but Keith found my name on it. He found me online and offered to sell it back to me. I was very happy. My dad used to put name stickers on my things, like my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s. I liked the sound, but I didn’t get very good. So, I switched to the electric guitar. It was the time of punk music, and you didn’t have to play well to be a rock star. When I got my guitar back, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. It felt smaller than I remembered. I played it again, and my fingers remembered the chords. Now, I want to play in a band. My son plays the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe I can find other people like me and call our band ‘The Regainers’!'"
37,B2,"'People are talking a lot about sleep now. I wrote a book called Insomniac about people who cannot sleep well. I said that not sleeping enough is bad for our mind, body, and mood. People who cannot sleep know how important sleep is. It is good that sleep is getting attention. But what about dreams? We do not hear much about dreams. We lose dreams when we wake up early. The last part of sleep is called REM, or 'Rapid Eye Movement'. This is when we dream the most. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of sleep time in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM. When people do not get REM sleep, they have more REM sleep the next night. This shows dreams are important. In 1953, researchers found REM. Many agreed with Sigmund Freud, who said dreams help us understand our mind. But later, researchers did not find this to be true. Now, dream study looks at the physical side of dreams. There is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold from Harvard University. Dreams are important. P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams more than other people. He says people who like to be creative use dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers use dreams because films are like dreams. But I think everyone needs dreams, not just artists. Everyone needs to think creatively. Dreams help us think in new ways. Stickgold says dreams help us find new ideas. When people wake up from REM, they have more original ideas. This is creativity, says Stickgold. I write better after dreaming. Even a bad dream helps me think. Creativity is not just for artists. We all need to think creatively in our lives. This is why we need to dream.'"

Susie is a famous copyist artist. She can paint like famous artists from the past, like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her paintings look so real that art experts think they are the originals. The real paintings are worth millions, but Susie's copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000. She paints for galleries and private collectors. Some people pretend her copies are real. Susie always signs her name on the back of her paintings. It is against the law to sell a copy as the real thing. Susie used to work as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She learned to be very accurate. Now, she tells young artists to learn to draw well. Susie likes painting French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. She says their art is hard to copy because it is both quick and careful. Susie does not paint her own art because she likes copying. She once tried painting fishing nets, but they looked like photos. Susie is a perfectionist.'"
39,B2,"Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and wanted to be the fastest sailor. She started sailing when she was a child. Ellen felt very close to her boats. When she was on land, she missed the ocean and wanted to sail again. She raced alone around the world in the Vendée Globe and came second. Her boat, Kingfisher, was her home for 94 days. She planned everything carefully, like how much food and supplies she needed. Ellen took care of her boat because her life depended on it.
Later, Ellen went to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. She helped with a bird survey and saw old whaling stations. This made her think about how people use up resources and move on. Ellen believes we need to save the planet. She says we should not use up things like coal, oil, and gas because they are limited. Instead, we should reuse things.
Ellen started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. It helps young people learn about a sustainable future. She talks to factories and governments about using resources wisely. Ellen says this work is important and different from sailing. She misses the adventure of the sea but feels her new work is more important."
40,B2,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he could become very famous. Many young people play on computers and games, but Jordan wants to inspire kids to go outside. Jordan's team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero'. Climbing Everest is part of their big goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he is 20.
Some famous climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say a young climber might be strong, but they worry if a teenager is ready emotionally. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to be safe. The Romeros know people say this. Paul says, ‘I know people criticize us, but we have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.’
I wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it his father’s idea? Paul says, ‘This is not about me. Jordan talked about it for the future, but we thought: ‘Why not now?’ We talk to him to make sure he still wants to do it.’ When I ask Jordan why he likes the challenge, he says, ‘I just focus on my goal.’
In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb is a record challenge. This is a problem for Jordan. People might say that winning is more important than having fun, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to share his story. This means writing online, taking photos, and giving interviews. He has to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, ‘If Jordan wants to stop climbing and play basketball, we will stop this project and go to the gym.’"
41,B2,"'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they don’t know who he is. I am studying music at university, but my classmates don’t know much about classical music either. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t have their music. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and classical CDs sell only about 300 copies each. It’s hard to believe. Why don’t people like classical music anymore? Older people say it’s because of TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s true. Classical music doesn’t interest most people, especially teenagers. Teenagers buy most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. I play in an orchestra, but I’m not a big fan of classical music. I like many styles, but I don’t listen to much classical music. Why don’t teenagers like classical music? Classical music changes mood a lot, and we like things fast. Experts say we can only pay attention for about three minutes, which is good for pop songs but not for classical music. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, and it talks about things teenagers care about. Classical music is powerful but doesn’t talk about teenage issues. How we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home, and concerts were the only other way to hear music. Now, we can find any music online, but we don’t often listen to classical music. When did you last hear classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people go to classical concerts now, but not many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don’t know why more people like classical music when they are older, but if teenagers’ parents like something, they usually don’t. Some say schools are to blame, but many kids like playing classical music in school orchestras. They practice a lot, but when they relax, they choose pop music.'"
42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to the school. Her mother didn’t hear her, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother knew how she felt. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden among trees. Mrs. Wyndham saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre. ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a path between trees. ""Walk beside me,"" said Mrs. Wyndham, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to do so. 
A few minutes later, her mother talked to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office. Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be in trouble soon anyway,"" she thought, ""so why not start now?"" She left and went to the riding centre. There was a nice building for the horses and a big place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She liked horses and treated them with respect. The horses looked well cared for. She walked along, looking at each horse. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony. The next horse surprised her. ""You’re the best!"" she said. He was brown with a little white. Lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" she said, petting him. ""In my dreams, I was riding you in a big competition."" His name was Maverick.
Bonnie wanted to ride him. ""Where can I find a bridle and saddle?"" she wondered. The room with the riding equipment was unlocked. She was happy to find it. She put a saddle on Maverick and forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said. ""I know about horses, even if I don’t know about other things."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The ride was exciting, and the wind felt nice on her face. She felt Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he’d jump well."

44,B2,"'I jumped out of bed and looked out the window at the river. The ice on the river was starting to crack in the morning sun. I looked at the sandbags that were there to stop the water from flooding the buildings. My back hurt from helping to put them there last week. I worked with many people from the town. My grandfather didn’t notice much. I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. He was trying to walk on the ice. I put on my kayaking wetsuit and checked my pocket for a silver chain. My grandfather gave it to me from a trip to South America. I also have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it at night. I went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex,’ Mom said. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I almost bumped into Grandpa in the hallway. ‘Watch where you’re going,’ he said. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘I’m going kayaking,’ I said. Grandpa gets angry sometimes. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. I took a deep breath. He went into the bathroom. Mom said, ‘Don’t mind him. He’s not himself.’ When I was a child, he was my hero. He has photos in National Geographic magazine. I want to be in that magazine too. Mom smiled. ‘Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination!’ I smiled back. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. I ate my banana and went to the boathouse.'"
45,B2,"Mum held Jess's arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table was a painting by Grandpa. It was not finished. ""Do you know about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I have never seen it before,"" she said. The painting showed a river. It was not a real river, maybe a fantasy one. The picture was strange but beautiful. There were no animals or people. It felt right that way. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Grandpa never named his pictures. Mum turned the picture over. Jess read the words: ""River Boy."" There was no boy in the picture. ""Strange, isn’t it?"" Mum said. ""Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it."" ""Mum! You should not have asked."" ""I know, but it is unusual. You can guess what he said."" Jess knew. Grandpa always said it is not the artist's job to explain a painting. Each picture has its own life. ""I hoped you might know something about this painting,"" Mum said. ""You seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" Jess knew the word. Grandpa used it when she watched him paint. But she thought he meant a goddess, not her. ""He does not need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He has been painting all his life."""
46,B2,"'This morning, I did not plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I am not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. Maybe if I tripped with Dad’s knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet. I did not wake up thinking, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is small, white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran kept china ornaments in it. I keep shells, fossils, and stones there. I was happy when Gran gave it to me! But it is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It needs to be in a corner. I have only two corners in my bedroom. My room is small, under the roof, and shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the back one is my sister Angela’s; the one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. But Angela is only fifteen, so I will be in my small room for a long time. I don’t mind; I like my little room. It’s cosy, like a nest. The roof slopes down, and the window is at floor level. The only problem is, there are not enough corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a bit too tall. If I could cut a few centimetres off the bottom... Then I thought, if I can’t cut the cabinet, maybe I can cut the carpet. It seemed like a good idea. Dad calls this lateral thinking. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box’. That is what I was doing!'"
47,B2,"'The novel ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of very small people who live hidden in a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to make a TV show of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' view, not a human one, which made filming harder. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the Borrowers' world, the crew had to film from very low down, no higher than 15 centimetres, to get their view. We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was making the shadows look right when the tiny Borrowers were shown with normal-sized backgrounds. We found a special way to do this. After the show was on TV, a famous US film director, George Lucas, called to ask how I did it. The only set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floor, with big objects to make the actors look small. It was very strange. When I asked them to carry big things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act. One important thing was getting the costumes right. I made them from heavy material so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the main actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit down during breaks, and she couldn’t take the dress off because it was sewn on every morning. The trousers for the main actor were made from a rug, as normal material would look too smooth. The weather was very hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for the costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to act with things that weren't there. I drew pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them. They weren’t very accurate, but they worked. We didn’t have money for special effects during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work fast – I once filmed a whole scene without film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the show was good at showing the magic of the books.'"

I like English. It is my favorite subject. I go to Room 214 on the second floor. I hear the teacher calling names. I sit down quietly. The girl next to me smiles. ‘Nice shoes,’ she whispers. I look at my shoes. They are expensive. ‘Thanks,’ I say. The teacher calls my name, ‘Desert McGraw?’ ‘Here,’ I answer. The teacher is Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. Then she lets us talk to each other. ‘Why did you move here?’ the girl asks. I think about what to say. My dad wanted to record a new album here. ‘My dad had to relocate,’ I tell her. ‘What does he do?’ she asks. ‘He’s an artist,’ I say. ‘Cool. I’m Becca,’ she says. She doesn’t seem to care much. Great.'"
49,B2,"'Today, American teenage girls have many things to do. They need to be good at school, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in everything. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Boys and girls cannot just go to school and do nothing special. They have a lot of homework, tests, activities after school, jobs, and chores at home. They also try to have a social life. Kristen, a teenager, says people forget how much pressure teenagers have. Even with all this work, people still think teenagers are lazy and only care about themselves. Kristen says this is not true. She uses her phone to help with her work, not just for fun. Teenagers need to be connected all the time. They use phones and tablets to do homework anywhere. Schoolwork does not stop at school; it needs attention all the time. Many teenagers wake up at 6 or 7 a.m. and go to bed after midnight. They have school, activities, family duties, and homework. They do not get enough sleep. Only 20% of teenagers get the nine hours of sleep they need. Some teenagers fall asleep in school because they are so tired. Lindamarie, another teenager, says she has only 18 hours of free time a week. She uses this time to volunteer, not just for social media or TV. She likes helping others and making a positive impact. In the future, teenagers will continue to show they are not just lazy or selfish. They will keep changing the world, even before they finish school.'"
50,B2,"'The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. This group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. It is a science project and an adventure, which is why teenagers like it. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are going to release a high-altitude balloon to try to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, making a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank is used to fill the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy drove seven hours to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time to let the balloon go. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they say, and the balloon goes up. Some of them run and watch it with flashlights until it is gone. There is quiet and a feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the clear sky. I see a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. The lunch box usually lands far from people. ‘Recoveries are a big part of the program,’ says the group’s leader. They have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘We learn about the land this way,’ he says. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. The team had to drive around the mountains to get it. They had to decide if driving or walking was better. It could be hard if the lunch box was on a high peak or in a tall tree. ‘These students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to them.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was on a rock in a waterfall. The camera did not record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but it was a chance to talk about atmospheric waves. And it was another adventure story to share.'"
51,B2,"Chloe Morgan did not like science or Palaeontology much until she was fifteen. It happened by accident. Her younger brother liked dinosaurs, but Chloe did not. She helped him with a science project and read an article about new dinosaur discoveries. This made her very interested in Palaeontology. 
Chloe met a famous palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius. She was nervous, but he was friendly and listened to her questions. This made her feel better.
Chloe talks about how movies show palaeontologists. She says movies like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs, but they do not show real palaeontologists well. In movies, they are shown as strange or funny people. Chloe says her job is different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, and writes for science magazines. She also talks to people about science.
Chloe thinks it is important to teach young people about science. She likes to talk about dinosaurs to get children interested in the natural world. This helps them learn about other science topics.
Chloe helped with a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She checked that the dinosaurs shown were correct. The show was popular because it showed dinosaurs in a new way.
Chloe thinks dinosaurs are interesting because they make us want to explore and discover new things. They remind us there is still much to learn about the world. Palaeontology is like time travel to her."
52,B2,"""I will say this one time: when you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not 'there yet' when you ask 'Are we there yet?' When you arrive, it is not 'there' anymore. It is 'here.' So, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' Parents want to be 'there' more than kids do. Kids should enjoy sitting in the back seat. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking out the window. Mum or dad is in the front seat, giving juice boxes and cookies, and changing the radio. They make sure everything is okay. Are we there yet? I hope not. But sometimes, my brother Tim does something bad, like putting his foot on my side. I put my foot on his side. Then we fight. Mum and dad stop us and tell Tim to stay in his seat. We calm down. Then, I feel air on my arm. Tim is blowing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks it is okay. I get angry. Tim gets in trouble again. Dad has ideas to keep us quiet. When we ask 'Are we there yet?' he says, 'Yes, get out of the car.' But we are still on the highway. So, we know we are not there yet. You know you are 'there' when mum and dad get out of the car and walk away from us. So remember: if mum and dad can still answer your question, you are not there yet."""
53,B2,"John and Zuzi Morgan have a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi want people to have fun and come back again. Zuzi says they started the café because people use phones and gadgets too much. They want people to talk and be together without screens.
In the café, people play games called 'Eurogames'. These games have gentle themes like farming. The first Eurogame was Catan, made by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In Catan, players build settlements and trade resources. Everyone stays involved until the end. Later, 'co-operative' games were made, where players work as a team. One popular game is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players solve global problems together.
Matt Leacock loved board games as a child, even though some games were disappointing. With his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular. It has a lot of storytelling, like video games. Players develop characters and the story changes.
Video games helped board games become popular. Many people play games on their phones now. Ben Hogg, from a games company, says more people like playing games today. Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many video games are online, and players are not together. So, some people want to play games with others in person again.
John and Zuzi's café is busy and popular. Board games are more than just fun. In our online world, games are a way to be together in real life. This trend will continue."

55,B2,"'Tony Connor is a new kind of famous person. He is very popular online, but many people who do not watch online videos might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist'. This means he rides his bike in difficult places, like on roofs or walls. People film his tricks and put them online. 
I met Tony in a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many local boys knew him, and even older people came to say he is 'a legend'. After watching him, I agreed. Tony is brave and creative. Before each trick, he tells me what he will do, and I am surprised when he does it. But when I say nice things to him, he does not seem very happy. 
Tony is famous because of the internet, but he does not like being a celebrity. He says, 'I find it hard to talk to fans. I like doing things more than talking about them.' This is funny because his fame comes from social media and cameras. He says, 'This technology helps me make money.' But he also thinks people spend too much time with cameras and screens. 
Tony makes good money from his videos. In the past, this would only be a hobby. I learned that to be a top athlete, you need energy and the ability to keep going after failure. These are more important than talent. In risky sports, you need mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times but kept trying until he succeeded.
Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people do not understand his sport. He gets advice from experts to stay safe. Tony is careful about risks. He says, 'Some people never get scared, but they should be careful. I feel fear but find a way to overcome it. I plan a lot before trying a new trick. I must be confident before I jump. If I am sure, then I am okay.''"

For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire. This is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net. She had a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen learned from an expert high-wire walker. She found out that high-wire walking was very different from other circus skills she knew. ‘The training was a surprise’, said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill. Then, I did exercises for an hour, and another hour after practising on the wire. I also learned how to fall onto the wire so I could continue if I slipped. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy. Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she walked step by step on the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterwards. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ But Helen is still planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"

Her course is popular because it teaches many things, like juggling, throwing and catching balls or even fire, and trapeze, which is flying through the air. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can watch some classes to see how their children are doing. Sophia says, “For a circus job, performers need to do different things all the time – it’s important to keep shows exciting. If you want to be good in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is important, but the best performers want success, have imagination, and always try to get better. People often think you might get hurt or only work a little each year. But really, you need to think about the future because you can only travel while you’re young, and then you need to think about other jobs.” The course also teaches business planning. Many students start businesses around the world and like to share their stories. Sophia warns, it’s not a job for making a lot of money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but a lot of fun!”'"

I was scared: I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.’ ‘One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. New songwriters do not always know which music is best for a female voice.

Our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. I asked Harry if I could go too, and he said yes! A few days before we left, there were storms where we were going. But the weather was good when we got there. I was busy at work, so I did not have much time to plan. But Harry said he took care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

There were islands far away, but it was foggy, so we could not see them well. I looked at the nice patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped to look at the rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish. I did not know many of them. It was nice not to worry about time. We always made lunch and dinner together over campfires. At night, we slept on the boats. The beds were hard, but it was very relaxing! When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I also wanted to tell everyone at home about our adventures!'"
66,B1,"'My dad was a basketball player in Germany, like his father. I watched many of his games when I was a kid. You might think I would love basketball, but I didn't. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, but I took a book to read instead of watching the games. When I started secondary school, I was not a teenager yet, but I was already two metres tall. My sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training, but I thought I needed more skills to play a real match. The teacher believed in me, and a few weeks later, I played against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it was OK! For the next four years, I practised every day and did well. I joined an adult team before moving to a sports academy in the USA at fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic players, and it was great to work with him. I missed my parents, but I got used to my new life, and my English got better! I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after going to the USA. I was taller than most players, but I needed to gain weight. My coach knew a team for me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it.'"
67,B1,"'Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and I liked it a lot. I saw my city in a new way. After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide. I learned that I needed a licence. To get it, I had to know many things about Chicago, like its buildings, history, and transport. After some months, I got my tour guide qualification. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts. You need to be fun and tell good stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy the tour. If they are happy, they write good reviews online. Good reviews bring more customers. I try to make my tours fun and stress-free. Because of this, my reviews are usually very good, and people recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago.'"
68,B1,"My name is Ella and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. Josie is five years younger than me. We went to help at a place for elephants. This place helps sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would like the other volunteers because they were older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing this. But in the end, it was okay.
Our main job was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants. This took most of the day. Josie thought it was hard work, but I liked seeing the elephants happy. We also washed the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even if I got very wet!
In the evening, we took the elephants to the forest where they stayed at night. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we knew it would be like that. The food was very good and did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, we talked and played games with the other volunteers and staff.
Now we are back in the UK. Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her, she says she loved it. I think she is a bit sad because she missed her friends too much. But she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day. I want to go back for sure!"
69,B1,"'I’m Gina D’Costa and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many people. Some people buy flowers for friends or for their homes. Hotels and offices also buy flowers. Sometimes, we help with photo sessions for businesses by giving flowers for their pictures. One time, I put flowers in a castle for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very happy with it. My day starts at 4 a.m. I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping then. My friends think I am crazy, but I love my work. It is often cold and dark, but I don’t mind. The flower market is great, with flowers from all over the world. There are many colors and smells. If I chose for myself, I would get pink flowers because pink is my favorite color. But I have to remember that other people like different flowers. Not all flowers are available all year. I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower-sellers, but it is part of the job. Flowers are not cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and put flowers in vases. Then we make flower bunches and decide how much they cost. Customers are often surprised by the price, and I sometimes ask them to choose again. Some people think this is too much work, but I like making nice flowers for the money people want to spend. That’s what you do when you sell things – I wouldn’t want any other job!'"
70,B1,"'My city has a modern cinema that shows all the new films I want to see. It also shows many films for kids on the weekends. The cinema is close to my home. But a year ago, I wanted to talk about films with people after watching them. So, I started a film club with two friends! We did not want to use a cinema to show films. Instead, we pick a new place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film about Antarctica. It was very cold, which was perfect for the film! Some places are free because they sell snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We just want to cover our costs, not make money. Each time we show a film, it gets easier, especially now that we have our own equipment. We sell tickets online, so we know how many people are coming. There is still a lot to do, but when people say they had a great time, it feels wonderful. Our website helps us connect with other film clubs in the country. We visit them to see how they do things, but we love our own club! We started a blog because people look online for film information. We also put posters in cafés. But the best way is when people tell their friends about us. The audience loves the special activities we do with each film. Last month, we had a movie quiz, and everyone enjoyed it.'"
71,B1,"'When I was a child, I loved taking photos. At 15, I wanted to do something special with my hobby. I decided to take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I liked the idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking photos of many things. Someone told me to focus on one topic to make my project better. I agreed and started taking photos of nature, like birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different because other young photographers took color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost stopped. But I trusted myself and felt better about my style. I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photo competition for people my age. I entered my photos for fun. I was so happy when I won first prize. It was the first time I thought my photography was good. Now, I have my own photo studio and I am happy with my career choice.'"
72,B1,"'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year. I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn new skills like public speaking. In the NYC, you can do many activities and learn new things. There are different levels: beginner to advanced. Adult volunteers, called ‘leaders’, help you. When you finish a level, you get a certificate. 
When I joined, my leader said I should help at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I was not sure because I went to that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and other children already had friends, so I stopped going. But I wanted my first NYC certificate, so I tried the challenge. Soon, I loved spending time at the children’s club. It was more than just getting a certificate. After the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep helping at the club. I made good friends with the children. Now, I go there for about four hours a week and I really enjoy it.
Because of the children’s club, I want to be a youth worker when I finish school in three years. A youth worker is someone who works with children. I never thought about this job before. I have learned a lot at the club and improved my communication skills. I have many NYC certificates now, and one is for camping!'"
73,B1,"'I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort, two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to encourage me to try snowboarding. I was young and did not think about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to try. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. After this, I loved snowboarding and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people do many competitions and get bored, but I still love it. I like winning too, and this makes me try harder. I enjoy not having a fixed plan. Once, I got a perfect score of 100 at a local competition. I was not sure I would try the jumps, but I did, and it was great. This made me trust myself more. In the summer, I train and study because there is no snow. I train every day, but I do not have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend time with my friends. It helps me when I cannot snowboard. I think about my future. Snowboarding is important to me, but I need another plan if I do not become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I wonder if I can be a doctor if I have time for college. I love snowboarding, but I know I cannot do it forever.'"
74,B1,"'When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I did not think about the future. For example, I did not know what job I wanted after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted a new phone too. My parents said I could have it if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a lot from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I did not like it. My parents said I could start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it was hard, but it was easy for me. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they liked them, but I thought they just wanted to be nice. I wanted to know if other people liked them too. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just me and my mum. Then, I knew it could work, so I made a website. Now, I make a lot of money from my business, mostly online. We still have our market stall too. It has been a lot of fun.'"
75,B1,"'Janine Stuart wrote a book called Being Amelia when she was only 13 years old. The book became very popular. Being Amelia is a little bit about Janine’s life. Janine said, ‘My family moved a lot because of my dad’s job, so I learned to make new friends. I know how it feels to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about Amelia, the main character, starting at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s life at home, especially with her older brother. I don’t have brothers or sisters, so I used my imagination for that.’ Janine started writing her book one summer when she was bored. Her mom wanted to be a writer, and her teachers told her to write, so it was a good way for Janine to spend her time. The year before, she won a short story competition for young writers. So, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they wanted to read it. They liked it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in stores. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the cover has happy teenagers, the story is about people facing hard times, and this makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says Janine is young, and her book is not very long, but she is a better writer than some other famous authors. Janine is still getting used to being famous: ‘At first, I hid when people saw me in the street, but now it’s OK. I want to help other young writers, but they need to find what works for them. For me, I just spend time with my friends, and then I have something interesting to write about!’'"
76,B1,"'I’m Tom. I’m fifteen years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father got a job as the castle’s manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and lets people visit them. He was happy about the job, but it took time for us to agree. We thought about living on the island. We knew the castle might not be as nice as our home across the water, and there was no school. After we moved, we got used to life on the island. The castle isn’t very pretty, but our apartment is nice. In summer, many people visit the island, and there are parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families on the island. There aren’t many teenagers, which I didn’t like. The adults help each other with fixing things, which is hard work. The biggest change for me was taking a boat to my old school every day. I wanted to go on stormy days with big waves, but the boats don’t go then! If I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I miss the last boat home, which is a problem. So, when friends come home with me, I tell them to hurry! But we see great views, like the sunset over the sea. Some days, it’s so foggy you can’t see anything, then it’s sunny again. It’s amazing! We have bad storms, and I worry if the castle is strong enough. But it’s been here for a long time, and it’s still standing!'"
77,B1,"'I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds there. I watched them with my parents. They showed me how to know different birds and where to see them. It was great! After we came home, I joined a birdwatchers’ club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different birds. I am close to this goal because on family holidays, I see birds from other countries too. We always look for places with birdwatching activities. I have been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I hoped to see my 200th bird there. I did not see it, but I learned to be patient. I posted a video online about my birdwatching. Many teenagers liked it and said it looked fun. My teachers saw it and asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was not nervous until I walked onto the stage. I had notes to help me, but the whole school and my friends were watching! I felt better when it was over. The teachers said I did well. I might do another talk next year! I am lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why teenagers in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are many birds to see, especially in green areas. Birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested. Everyone needs to connect with nature, and it does not have to cost much money.'"
78,B1,"'I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and soon, I was not a bad player. My family knew I liked new hobbies and then stopped them, so they thought I would stop playing football too. But I did not stop. I dreamed of playing football as a job when I was older. The chance came sooner than I thought. I played in local games, and one referee saw I was a good player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. She asked me to join her club. I was surprised – I did not know young girls could join women’s clubs. The manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13. I got much better. Some people still thought I would not be a star player, and that made me a bit sad. But the coach told me to be myself and believe in myself. He even let me play in a big match! I ran very hard – I did not want the other players to blame me if we lost. By luck, I scored the winning goal. I could hear my coach cheering for me, and after the match, the team carried me around the field. It was fantastic! Since then, I have scored many more winning goals! Next month, my coach and I are having a football tournament in my area. We want teenagers to like football and talk to other players in my club. They will see the professional environment and feel they can play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them is the same as my coach gave me – you will have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I have had very few bad times, so I have been lucky!'"
79,C2,"'In the UK and other countries, schools and universities want students to start doing research early. Research is not just for famous scientists or big universities. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research helps in school and at work. It is about asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? 
Research can be big and complex, or it can be simple and about everyday things. Students have done research in school projects and at work. You ask questions and find answers when you plan a holiday, grow plants, fix things, or shop online.
In college, you need to ask questions, think about what you read, and make your own ideas. In some places, people think knowledge is already known, and you learn by listening to teachers. But in the UK, US, and other places, you should question what you learn. 
Critical thinking is important. You should not just repeat what you read. Think about it and see if it makes sense. Check if the information is true and backed by evidence. Do not just believe everything you read or hear.'"
80,C2,"'Cities have always been places where people think and create. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafés. But living in a city is not easy. The same London coffee houses also spread disease, and Picasso moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural. Scientists are studying how cities affect our brains. They found that city life can make us tired and think less clearly. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that people in hospitals get better faster when they see trees. Even a little bit of nature helps our brains because it gives us a break from city life. More people now live in cities than ever before. We live in crowded places with many people around us. This can affect our mental and physical health. In a busy city, our brains have to pay attention to many things, like people walking and cars driving. This is tiring because our brains have to work hard to focus. Nature, on the other hand, is relaxing and helps our brains rest. This idea is called attention restoration theory. It says that being in nature helps our brains recover. Parks in cities, like Central Park in New York, give people a break from city life. A walk in a park can help our brains work better. People try many things to think better, like energy drinks, but being in nature is very helpful. Even though city life can be hard, cities still grow. They are places where people meet and share ideas. This makes cities creative. The busy streets and many people help new ideas happen. The challenge is to keep the good things about cities while reducing the stress they cause. Sometimes, people want to leave nature and go to the city for excitement.'"
81,C2,"'Where is the mind? We might think the mind is only in our heads. Today, we have machines that can look inside the brain. But I think the mind is not just in the brain. Many things, like tools and writing, help us think. For example, a blind person uses a stick to feel. The stick becomes part of their body. This shows that the mind can be outside the head. I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET says that things like tools and symbols help us think. They change how we think over time. Humans use tools to learn and understand the world. This makes our minds grow and change. MET helps us see how things like stone tools and smartphones change our minds. Humans have always used things to help them think, from the past to now.'"
82,C1,"'Photography has changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became very important. It is used in many ways: for science, industry, art, and fun. Some people say photography is the best thing the US gave to art. Photography started in the mid-19th century. Why did people like it? First, photography was a new technology. People in the US liked new things. Like trains and electricity, photography helped people see the world. Second, people used cameras to show who they were. Photos helped people and families keep memories. Photos look real, which matched the US artists' style of showing real life. A photo shows what the photographer wants us to see. Photos are made by machines, so they are records of what was in front of the camera. But, because a person takes the photo, it also shows their view. People think photos are a 'universal language' because we can understand them easily. But photos can mean different things. We need to know why the photo was taken and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things at different times. Artists now use photos in their work. For example, Andy Warhol used photos in his art. Photography is now a big part of art, just like painting.'"
83,C1,"'In 1890, William James, an American thinker and doctor, called psychology the 'science of mental life.' This is still a good way to start understanding psychology today. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we know a little about this. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is mostly about humans. James thought human psychology had basic parts: thoughts and feelings, the world around us, and how we know about these things. This knowledge is personal and comes from our own thoughts and experiences. Sometimes, we think we know why people act a certain way, like feeling sad or quitting a job. But people can see things differently. Psychology tries to find out which ideas are right. Psychologists help us see the difference between our own ideas and scientific facts. They study the mind and brain, but they do not know everything about how the brain works. So, they learn by watching how people act. Psychology is like solving a puzzle. It uses clues from what we see and measures them carefully. Psychology wants to describe, understand, predict, and change things. It helps in many areas, like teaching children to read or helping people talk about their feelings. People have talked about psychology for a long time, but it has been studied scientifically for about 150 years. Early psychologists looked at their own thoughts to find answers. This was not always helpful. Today, psychologists watch how people behave to learn more.'"
84,C1,"'In a simple building in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum has many products that people did not want to buy. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who works at the museum, thinks each product has a sad story. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who used to work in marketing, wanted to collect new products. He started doing this in the 1960s. He found out that most products do not succeed. So, his collection became mostly products that failed. Many people like to think positively, even if things might not go well. Some people believe that if you imagine good things, they are more likely to happen. But research shows that thinking too much about success can make people less motivated. Psychologist Carol Dweck says that how we think about our abilities affects how we deal with failure. Some people think abilities are fixed, while others believe they can grow with effort. People who think abilities can grow see failure as a chance to improve. This way of thinking can make people happier.'"
85,C1,"**Text for A1 Level:**
Sports teams often play better at home. But why? People have different ideas. Sports are changing a lot now. Two things make us think about home advantage: science and money. 
Sports scientists study why players do well. They have many ideas about home advantage. People with money want to know if home advantage is important. They think if players get paid a lot, they should play well anywhere.
Fans are important too. For example, Manchester United fans in England think their team needs their support. Fans believe they help their team score goals. But sometimes, the team does not score even when fans cheer loudly.
One thing is true: fans can affect referees. In an experiment, referees watched a game with and without crowd noise. Referees with noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This shows fans can influence referees.
Home advantage is less now than before. In the 1890s, home teams won 70% of the time. Now, they win 60%. Travel is easier now, and stadiums are similar.
Different sports have different home advantages. Basketball has a big home advantage, football too. Baseball has the smallest home advantage. In basketball, teamwork is important, and playing at home helps.
Another reason for home advantage is players feel more confident at home. Their testosterone levels are higher before home games. This makes them want to defend their home. In the Rugby World Cup, home teams sometimes won against stronger teams.
In sports, playing at home can be like ""the law of the jungle."""
86,C1,"""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player many years ago. This saying is famous in sports. It means: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate. This debate asks if talent is something you are born with or something you learn. Many people think practice is more important than talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson says you need 10,000 hours of practice to be an expert. Books like Outliers and Talent Is Overrated agree with this idea. But, in his book, Epstein says it is not always true. He looks at why some people are very good at what they do. He travels to places like Kenya and Alaska to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that sled dogs’ success might be because of their genes. This shows that both nature (genes) and nurture (practice) are important. Epstein says both are needed for success. He also talks about race and gender in sports. He asks why men and women compete separately if only practice matters. This shows the topic is complex."""
87,C1,"'A new report says many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why children feel this way. In her book, Kith, she says children stay inside too much, watching TV or using computers. They do not play outside in nature, like in the woods or by rivers. This is a big problem, she thinks. 
A study talked to children and found they want to play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their childhoods fondly. They played outside, swam in ponds, and built dens. They think this was better and healthier than how children live now. But these adults also keep their own children inside because they worry about safety.
Griffiths talks about how parents' fear helps toy companies sell more gadgets. She also mentions how some children are given medicine for being restless or have to wear goggles for games. She is not sure how common these things are, but she is very passionate about them.
Griffiths believes children should have freedom to explore and take risks. She says children need small accidents to learn. But she does not say how to make sure these accidents are small. Also, not all children want to explore. Some are shy and like to stay home. Maybe the real problem is making all children do the same thing, whether staying inside or going outside.'"
88,C1,"'I am a scientist who studies the mind and behavior. I went to school for a long time. I am good at solving problems, but not because of school. Most problems in life need experience, not just school learning. For children, this experience comes from playing. My research is about how play helps children grow. All young animals, including humans, play. Animals that need to learn more, play more. For example, animals that hunt play more than animals that eat plants. Children play more than other young animals because they have a lot to learn. Play helps children learn important skills. These skills are not taught in school. They learn to think creatively, work with others, and control their feelings. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can solve new problems. Creative people often play. Albert Einstein said school almost made him lose interest in math and science, but he found it again after school. He called his work 'combinatorial play'. We cannot teach creativity, but we can stop it by making school too strict. It is important to get along with others and work together. Children learn this by playing with other children. Play is something you choose to do. If you cannot stop, it is not play. In play, everyone must be happy to keep playing. School has become harder: less playtime, more homework, and more pressure for good grades. Outside school, adults control sports and play. This has changed slowly but a lot over time. Parents are more worried, and experts warn about dangers. People think children learn more from adults than from each other. But children need more play, not more school. We must let children play and explore. This helps them grow into strong adults for the future.'"
89,C1,"'In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them talk directly to employers. This is different from the past when people had to stand outside offices with signs saying 'hire me'. But using social media can also lead to mistakes. For example, a young person in the US asked a marketing executive on LinkedIn to share her contacts. She was upset and said no, sending a mean reply that many people saw online. This story shows that using social media for jobs can be tricky. Many young people use Facebook and Twitter for fun, but using them for work is different. Some young people are too confident and make mistakes when talking to employers online. Employers say young people can seem rude or too familiar. This can make it hard for them to get jobs, even if they have the right skills. To contact someone on a professional site, say who you are and offer to help them. Do not send the same message to everyone, and be polite. Social media can help you find jobs, but you need to use it carefully.'"
90,C1,"'It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. Since 2000, many UK newspapers have lost a lot of readers. In the USA, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers now, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think newspapers will disappear in 15 years. But old media often survive. For example, theatre is still popular even with newspapers, cinema, and TV. Radio is still popular in the TV age. Cinema is still popular even with videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are popular again. Newspapers were once new too. They became popular in the 19th century because of new technology like the steam press and telegraph. People started to want news regularly. In the past, people did not expect change. They only noticed big events like famine or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. Before that, people did not need news every day. Newspapers have a set format and schedule, which can be limiting. Online news is different. People can read news when they want and choose what interests them. Online news can update quickly and correct mistakes. There is no limit to how much can be written. But online news often focuses on being first and getting comments, not on understanding. In the past, news was shared in places like markets, where it was mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand the world better.'"
91,C1,"'Humans are not like animals that see well at night. We need sunlight to see. Our eyes are made for the day. But we have changed the night by adding lights everywhere. This is called light pollution. Light pollution happens when lights shine up into the sky instead of down to the ground. This makes the night too bright and affects animals and people. For example, birds can get confused by bright lights and fly into buildings. Some birds sing at night because of the lights. Light pollution also affects our health because we need darkness to sleep well. Long ago, people used candles and lanterns, and the night was dark. Now, cities are very bright at night. This makes it hard to see the stars. We need darkness to remember our place in the universe and to keep our bodies healthy.'"
92,C1,"'The boss of a big company said his workers can take as many holidays as they want. He got the idea from another company. His daughter sent him an email about it. The big company has 50,000 workers and does many things like finance, transport, and healthcare. The other company has 2,000 workers and does one thing. It might be easier for the smaller company to let workers take holidays because they know each other's work better. The boss of the big company said workers can take holidays if they are sure their work is done and it won't hurt the company. But is it really possible to be sure? When you come back from holiday, there is always more work to do. Some people might feel bad about taking holidays and not go at all. This can make them stressed and less productive. Also, workers might feel pressure from others about how long they take off. In some companies, people work late and might not take holidays even if they can. If workers don't have a set number of holidays, they might feel they can't take time off because they don't want to look lazy. Technology makes it hard to know when work stops and free time starts. The other company started this holiday idea because workers asked about it. They said if work hours are not clear, why should holiday time be? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Workers might feel they are always being watched. Laws give workers a minimum number of holidays because rest is important for health. The good things like happiness and creativity from taking holidays can happen without this new idea. So, is this holiday idea really good for workers?'"
93,C1,"'Journal-based peer review is when experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This helps make sure the research is good. It can take a long time, sometimes up to a year. Is it worth the wait? Yes and no. The way we publish science is changing. I still think papers should be checked before they are published, but things are moving. Preprints are part of this change. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed. They help share new results quickly so others can read and discuss them. Publishing in journals is often about fame and career growth, which can lead to problems. Scientists want to publish in top journals, but this can make them cut corners. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good. This can depend on how interesting the topic is, not just the quality. Many people know these problems, but few want to change the system. Preprints might help because they are not a big change. Some think journals won't accept papers shared as preprints, but this is not true. There is also a worry that without review, bad science will be published, but this hasn't happened yet. Preprints are open for everyone to read and discuss. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, says preprints helped her share her work and get feedback. Preprints let scientists talk about their work with others around the world. They can also share results that are not new discoveries, which journals often ignore. Preprints make papers more read and cited. They focus on the work, not where it is published.'"
94,C1,"'When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say ‘a painting in words’. Their answers don't satisfy me. One day, I asked them to choose an object and write about it in two ways. First, like a scientist, and second, as if the object is speaking. The second part was called ‘Poem.’ One student wrote: Poem I may look strange, but I help people breathe. I am used in emergencies for a short time. Most people never use me. The object? An oxygen mask. This choice helped the class see how poetry is different. The exercise was fun and led to good talks. When I was in school, poetry was hard for me. Poems seemed like puzzles. After school, many people read fewer poems. Sometimes, you see a poem and it dares you to read it. Often, it is confusing or disappointing. But you feel good for trying. What do we want from poems? Deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever words? Maybe. But for tears, we watch movies. For information, we read articles. Novels let us escape, paintings are nice to look at, and music is special. But poems can be unclear, like life. This doesn’t tell us what a poem is. If you search online, it says poetry is art with rhythm and sound. But the word ‘poem’ comes from Greek, meaning ‘a thing made.’ Poets say poems are like wild animals or machines. But these ideas don’t fully explain poems. Talking about poems helps us think differently. Poems can change how we see things. Like songs, poems can stay in our minds. Words can be powerful. A poem in a newspaper can stand out. It uses space that could be for something else. A poem is written and rewritten, but it is not made to sell. Poems are special and can surprise us.'"
95,B2,"I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money. My wife, Marion, was happy when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. I like finding old things because it makes me feel connected to the past. After the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 
One rainy February afternoon, I went to a place with old farming tools. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug in the mud and found a round, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, but it was a beautiful gold necklace called a torc. It looked like the Great Torc in the British Museum, from over 2,000 years ago.
I took it home and showed Marion. We didn't try it on because it was too special. I hid it in our house because I was worried. The law says I had to tell the authorities about it in 14 days. I showed it to a friend in the hospital and then took it to the council office. They checked it and sold it to my local council. Now, it is in the British Museum in London. I got £350,000, which I shared with the field's owner.
Finding the torc was amazing, but I still enjoy looking for other things. People ask if I will stop now, but I won't. It's like fishing; you always hope to find something bigger next time."
96,B2,"'I love sleeping when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. My friends plan their trips with many activities, like visiting museums and hiking. I smile and listen, but I don't say much. What would they think if they knew I plan time for naps in the afternoon and lazy mornings in bed? Sleeping better is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept – more than 12 hours a day. There were noisy birds, but I still slept well. Far from home, I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes easier. I think sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break. When we travel, we see and hear new things. We take in new cultures, music, and places. We process all this when we sleep, so sleep feels more intense. Sleep changes in different places. People talk about jet lag, but I think adjusting to new places is more about local habits than time zones. In Trinidad, people wake up early, rest when it's hot, and become active in the evening. Even though Trinidad is only one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. When I do, I feel like I belong. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all took naps. I understood why they had many pillows. I joined them and experienced the siesta, a Latin American tradition. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Away from my normal routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds when I sleep in a new place. Slow travel means enjoying every moment, and sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too.'"
97,B2,"'The woman looked away from the mirror. ‘What do you think? And be honest.’ Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a pretty bow. ‘I still think this one looks best on you,’ she said nicely. The woman made a face. ‘But it is so boring,’ she said. ‘Everyone will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little hat will make me special.’ She touched the red and black small hat on her head. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘this is the one I want.’ Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would look special at the wedding. She thought about her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was happy to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also excited to meet Jen’s friend. They did not know much about this friend. Her husband Jeff had asked, ‘Tattie? What kind of name is that?’ ‘It’s short for Tatiana,’ Mia said. ‘I think it’s nice.’ Jeff did not like fancy things. He always said Mia was too polite. He would have told the woman in the shop that she chose the wrong hat. He might have said a trash can lid would look better. ‘You’re too polite,’ he often told Mia. An hour later, Mia closed the shop and went home. Her shop was next to her house. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia had an idea. She turned the barn next to their house into a shop. Jeff was not sure. ‘Do you think people want hats?’ he asked. Mia knew they did. Her friends always said it was hard to find the right hat. She was right. From the first day, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in Little Pelham. They could try on many hats. Mia also sold handbags and jewelry.'"

It was mid-September, but there was no snow in Siberia yet. I saw no people, just mountains, streams, and forests. My neighbor woke up and smiled. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a Russian accent. Sergei was from Moscow. He was going to sell safety clothes to miners. His English was not very good, and my Russian was not good either. But with a dictionary, I told him I was going to Magadan in Siberia. I had a one-way ticket because I wanted to go back to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I said I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I said. Sergei still looked unsure. He said ""Holodna"" (cold) and pointed outside. I told him I had warm clothes, but I did not say I had little money. My clothes were cheap. I was not sure they would work. My big over-trousers cost £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students. Some were taking notes. The lecturer talked on. I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I wrote a note: ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" Al was in front of me. I tapped him and gave him the note. He read it, thought, wrote something, and gave it back. I read it. ""OK,"" it said. Six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia. I was a geography teacher. The job was hard but good. It was not boring, and I had long holidays for adventures. Twice, I met Al during holidays. After our bike ride in Pakistan, Al wanted more adventures. He decided to cycle around the world. This was his biggest challenge. Sometimes he thought he could not do it. It was hard, but I envied him. He was having a big adventure.

100,B2,"'In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots race through tall pylons. The pylons are 15 to 25 meters high. The pilots make sharp turns and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to try it. One hour before the flight, I signed two forms. The first form said I was healthy. The second form said I would empty my pockets. Small things can be dangerous in the flight. I learned to stay focused. 'The horizon is your best friend,' they said. The pilot would tell me where to look. I promised to relax when flying upside down. I had a safety talk. They told me not to touch anything. When we were on the runway, I was nervous. My feet did not touch the pedals. My hands did not touch the switches. I decided not to relax. To stay safe, I had to be calm and focused. I had to tense and relax at the right times. Panicking was bad. The plane started to move. Dario, the pilot, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540. It is one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off and turned right. I felt the air push on me. I looked at the horizon and tensed up. For a moment, I felt very heavy. Then we flew straight. We turned left and dived. My stomach felt strange. We flew close to the ground between two pylons. We went 400 km per hour. We turned right. I was excited but scared. I flew the plane for two minutes. My hand shook. The plane shook too. Then Dario did a barrel roll. It is a full 360-degree turn. 'Are you okay?' he asked. 'Yes,' I said, but I was not sure. Then he did a loop. We flew in a circle. Some people like this. I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, I heard, 'Relax, look up.' I saw fields. The flight was 10 minutes long. It was easy compared to a real race. Dario ate a sandwich after we landed. I did not eat for hours. That night, I dreamed of flying in loops.'"
101,B2,"Doug Allan films animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature film, he probably filmed them. He likes it when the temperature is -18C. Allan studied marine biology and was a commercial diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned about cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. He helped the crew and realized he loved being a wildlife cameraman. He likes travel, adventure, and underwater filming. Now, he is a top cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife shows. 
When he started 35 years ago, cameras were simple. It is easier to film today. Before, you had to remember what you filmed. Now, with digital technology, you can see it right away. Film was expensive, so you filmed less. Today, you can film a lot. 
Allan is good at working in cold places. He feels comfortable on sea ice. He says there are no leeches, diseases, or mosquitoes in these places. Wildlife filming has successes and failures. Once, he went to the Orkneys to film birds but could not find the right ones. 
Recently, he filmed in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. It is a place with polar bears and is very cold, usually -32C in April. The wind is strong, and carrying cameras in the snow is hard. After 23 days, he saw only one mother bear and her cub. On day 24, he saw more bears. He watched a mother bear come out of her den with her cubs. It was a special moment. 
Now, Allan wants to make a film about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to people who live there and see the changes. He thinks he can make a great documentary."

Now, he is back in the Arctic for a new trip. This trip is very important. Pen and two friends will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole. They will measure the ice. No one has done this before. The information will help scientists understand global warming. Pen was trained for this. As a child, he was cared for by a woman who worked for a famous explorer. She sent him outside in cold weather with little clothing. His father loved cold adventures, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps with his polar guide business. Mary says Pen is in more danger driving at home than in the Arctic. For fun, Mary once raced Pen in a mountain event. She finished an hour before him. Pen and Mary have two children. Pen finds it hard to leave them. Last time, he told his son to take care of the family, which was too much for him. This time, Pen will not call them much.

103,B2,"I had a year off. What was I going to do? Being an Olympian is special. I had time to write, work on TV, and talk to businesses and schools. These activities were fun, but I wanted something competitive. I wanted to stay fit in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I joined marathons and triathlons. That was good, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's question: ""Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?"" I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to my rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. If I joined, I would want to win. Would Ben help me win? No. But being the underdog sounded fun. I called Ben. He was going to do the race and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. The race was possible. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000. It was a lot of money. I also thought about losing money from not working. Speaking at business events is a good way to earn money. People like to hear about my past, but I wanted a new goal. Doing the race meant I could talk about rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. Being an athlete was hard, but simple. I trained every day, but I had help from doctors and dieticians. I worried people would think I just wanted to be on TV with Ben. But during our preparations, I stopped worrying. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than rowing. Ben had done tough things before, but he couldn't row well. I was surprised by this, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."

I found a small company run by Anna and her husband, Pasi, in Finnish Lapland. They let me work as a husky dog handler for the winter. From December to February, tourists go on sled rides pulled by huskies. The company started with six dogs and now has more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm' with no running water. I could join them for three months if I was ready for hard work.

People were getting the dogs ready for sleds. The dogs were very excited. I joined them and got into a sled. We went into the dark with only a light on our heads. November 15, Hetta I quickly learned to be a husky guide. Anna asked if I was useful. I didn’t know. I had never driven a snowmobile or chopped wood. But I had a driving license. I learned the basics of dog-sledding: lean in corners, use the brake to stop, and don’t let go. Feeding the dogs was hard because water freezes. We made a 'soup' of meat and hot water for them. After a week, I was tired but happy. 'I can chop wood and use tools,’ I told my friends. 'In the snow.’'"

Her time was so good that she could compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Reporters asked her about using emu oil, a natural treatment. Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had told her about it. Radcliffe used it after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she did not really understand how big her achievement was. She and her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometres, Radcliffe's agent worried she was running too fast. Hartmann was angry about this but understood why someone might think it was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe thought she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She ran the last part in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run faster.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he did not think anyone would beat that time soon. Radcliffe thought she would try again next year, but it did not happen. People wanted to know how she beat the East African runners. Hartmann worked with Radcliffe a lot, helping her with the pain from running so much. He said she was very strong and could handle a lot of pain. Hartmann traveled from Ireland to France to help her. Radcliffe was always ready to train hard. Other athletes were upset because Hartmann spent so much time with her. Radcliffe does not know why no one has beaten her record. She trained very hard but thinks others are more talented. She thought Mary Keitany might beat her record. Radcliffe says she always pushed herself and never relaxed. That marathon was her best race.

106,B2,"'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, started, I did not know if people would like it. At that time, many people were talking about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I thought our show was new and different, but I was still worried. Would people like a cooking show with history, memories, and science? I watched the first show feeling both happy and scared. I did not need to worry. The show was a success and led to other projects, like a book about my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote more books in a series called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was real, with travel and meeting new people. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest book. In it, you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best pasta. These people have spent many years trying to be perfect. Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the show was hard. I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But after a long meeting, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on feelings, memories, and places. I knew the recipes were not 'perfect', but I used my skills and talked to food experts to find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV show let me explore new foods, people, and places. I was excited to learn about memory and nostalgia in food. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. I had adventures like visiting a tomato factory that used the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that was not good enough to film. I learned new techniques, like hand-milking a cow to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down to make pizza.'"

They were both older than Lucy, about ten years older. They spoke English well and talked about the music they played and their travels.
Lucy said, ""I think I'm going to Tanglewood this summer."" It sounded impressive. But Lucy didn't really want to go. She didn't want to do many of the things she did, like concerts and competitions. These events made her miss a lot of school. She wasn't in school anymore and studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco.
Lucy didn't even want to come to the Prague Festival. Only fifteen pianists her age were chosen from around the world. Lucy's dad bought her a necklace to celebrate, and her teacher, Grace Chang, took her to dinner to plan her music. Lucy's mom had sent in the application for her. Lucy thought her mom didn't want her to say no.
The man from Tokyo asked Lucy, ""How old are you?"" She said, ""Fifteen."" He looked at the woman, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't want to brag. She just wanted to fit in.

109,B2,"""‘You spend too much time online. You need to go outside,’ said Dad. I wanted to know what experts say about this. Research shows that many teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends and are learning important skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says social media is a big part of growing up today. Teenagers live in it, not just use it like adults. It’s not good or bad; it depends on how you use it. Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says social media is like a virtual youth club. It helps teenagers find out who they are and learn to get along with others. Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says social media can help teenagers understand themselves. They can share their favorite music or sports and see different opinions. People who use social media a lot are not as self-centered as those who don’t. Social media can be easier for shy people because it’s less scary than talking face-to-face. Professor Andrew Phillips studies young people using social media. He says it helps quiet people with special interests find others like them. Pauline White, a digital education expert, says teenagers who find new interests online and create content are using social media well. They make videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites help photographers learn and share. This can help them get jobs in the future. Businesses use social media to sell and need people who understand it. Teenagers who use social media creatively will benefit when they work. Matthews agrees that working with others online is an important skill for jobs today."""

Rose was not a wild child. Her school reports were good. In five weeks, Rose would start a new school and make new friends. It was her fourth school in five years. She felt ready for it. This was her last move, and she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new start in her life."
112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to think she might write a book. Charlotte thought writing a book was a big challenge. When she was 13, she decided to try. Now, her book is about to be published. She told her old teacher, who was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait if she was good at it.
Charlotte is 15 years old now, and her book is a big success. It has a strong story and lots of action. It doesn’t seem like a teenager wrote it. Charlotte is confident and smart. She knows she is young and doesn’t have all the answers. She wanted to ask big questions in her book, like about taking responsibility.
Charlotte thinks many books for teenagers show them in three ways: as outsiders, as naïve, or as awkward. She didn’t like this. She wanted to write about teenagers who are okay as they are. She believes teenagers can know who they are, even if they are young.
Charlotte likes reading fantasy books, but they almost stopped her from writing. She thought she had to write about deep things to be good. She learned from a book called How Not to Write a Novel that if readers can guess what happens next, the story loses suspense.
Charlotte’s parents are journalists, and this helped her get her book read. Her father knew someone in publishing. She knows she was lucky, but she also believes writers succeed because of their talent."
113,B2,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked at the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one man, David, who knew a bit about ski-jumping, went first. He skied fast and jumped. His arms were in the air. We saw something was wrong. We watched. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is tricky.’ Maybe I was not good at this freestyle skiing. On other ski holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I was not one of those teenagers who did tricks on ramps in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I did not know how to do it. My parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing school in the US. It had a big indoor place with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes. After practising inside, students went outside to try for real. ‘You will get better!’ the school said. ‘Before places like this, new ski jumpers just went down the slopes and hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you land on the flat part, you will be in trouble.’ The ‘flat part’ is the section before the slope goes down again. Land in the right place and you keep moving. Land on the flat and you stop, which hurts. So, you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body go fast to the jump. My legs slowed down, so I landed on the flat part. I did not fall, but I felt tired. ‘You need to control the jump,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I would not like being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some moves were like ski-jumping, others helped us know what our body was doing in the air. Gareth talked to us. My ‘air sense’ needed work. Every time I tried, I only knew the moment before jumping, then I was in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. I had more problems before I landed right. Gareth was happy, and I was proud. But it did not last. On the last run, I did not slow down, jumped, and landed in the right place. Then I saw my skis going down the slope without me."""
114,B2,"'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at a fun park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight. The ride stops, and you take a deep breath. Then, the rollercoaster goes up slowly. It pauses. Suddenly, it drops fast, and you feel your stomach in the air. You go forward, left, and upside down. You scream because you are scared. But you chose to be here, like many people who visit theme parks every year. 
Theme parks are big business. They have exciting rides to make people happy. Many people work to make these rides, like engineers and designers. They want to make rides fun and safe. Making a rollercoaster is hard. It needs to be fun and a little scary, but not dangerous. 
A long time ago, a man named John Miller made many rollercoaster ideas. Today, people still use his ideas. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts said it is about making people feel excited but safe. 
Rollercoaster teams create stories, like space adventures or jungle chases, to make rides more fun. Professor Walker said that experience and trying new things help make good rides. Jeff Hornick, a theme park director, said designers need to love thrills to understand what people want. 
I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said it can add to the ride, but the real rollercoaster experience is still the most important part. He thinks this will stay true for many years.'"
115,B2,"'Miranda Ellington is 25 years old. She is a choreographer and has made dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. Miranda likes to dance because it reminds her of how it feels to be a dancer. She says it can be hard and stressful. As a choreographer, she teaches young students. She likes working with them because they are open to new ideas and want to succeed. They listen to feedback, even if it is not always nice. When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. Sometimes she does not like the music, but she still tries to make a good dance. She cannot change the music because it is already chosen. Miranda likes to meet new people and work in different places. She changes how she works each time. She watched a documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. She thinks it shows the real life of dancers. Miranda believes a great dance show has good music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. Everything must work well together. She does not want to be known for just one type of dance. She wants to try many things.'"
116,B1,"'A friend asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said you can see great things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to see? This talk gave me the idea for my fun four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and used old seatbelts to pull it. I put my bags on the sofa and slept on it each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends helped me pull the sofa and cheered me on. I have walked a lot in the past, but this was new. It was the longest walk I have done, and it was on main roads. I could stop at a café and relax on the sofa with a coffee. I often told people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks about my weekend, I like to say how I pulled a sofa 100 miles across southern England, not talk about the latest TV show. You can see the film on my website.'"
117,B1,"'I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands. I was excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I traveled with before, was busy. So, I decided to try a group holiday. At the Greek port, the man was curious when I asked for one ferry ticket. The islands are popular with families. I told him I would join ten others to swim around the islands. He was still puzzled, but he smiled and showed me on board. Our group sent emails before we started, but we did not have much time to talk before our first swim. Our guides said a support boat would be with us, and showed us how to talk to it. We did a short swim to make speed groups. Then, it was time for our first 1.5 km swim. I was nervous. I trained in my local pool and did some river swimming, but never in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger. I was at the back of the slow group. I watched faster swimmers move ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first swim, and I was happy when I did it alone. The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a good speed, and stopping to look at the scenery. The swims got longer, and I got faster and happier. We did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come again next year.'"
118,B1,"'Being a flight attendant is not easy. But since I started, I have traveled a lot, from the US to Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. This makes it a good job for a young person like me! As a child, I went to a school in another country, away from my family. I flew alone when school started and ended. I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers. Some said yes. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and find something new. At the interview, there were many young people, and many got the job. They were often very qualified like me and wanted a new career. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and past work experience, not just that I loved to travel. I got the job! I recommend this job to anyone because there are many good things about it. The free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and we say, ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family. Even if we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. If I have difficult passengers, which is not often, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!'"
119,B1,"'At the summer camp where I work, I like seeing the children do things they thought they couldn't do. Most children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel scared, but after we help them, they try and reach the top. This makes them feel happy. Some children miss home at the start of the week. It's not the very young ones who miss home the most – it's the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we say they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's too late now, do it tomorrow. Most children feel okay in a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time. Sometimes, it's not the children who feel lonely. We have parents who call a lot, asking how their child is doing, which is not needed. Often their child is busy, playing games or doing something else, so we tell the parents to call back later. We often see a certain type of child coming, usually wearing new, expensive clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something better for camp, but soon they understand why.'"
120,B1,"'Rock the Planet is a musical show. The actors must be good musicians. It started in London last year. Before that, it was in the USA for five years. It won ‘Best Musical’ four times there! In the UK, young actors can do fewer shows each week than in the USA. So, they needed more actors in London. The director found many talented actors in the UK. They won their first ‘Best Musical’ award in London. The London theatre is bigger than the one in the USA. It is full every night. People want to hear the songs from America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said, ‘I get paid to play a beautiful Gibson guitar.’ Jamie said the young actors are busy. They have school lessons at the theatre. He misses his old school friends. His class came to see the show. The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. His class loved the show. Jamie’s parents come when they can, but it is expensive. I told Jamie I play guitar too. He gave me a guitar to play with him and the other actors. We played a song called Days. Jamie helped me learn it. I was happy when I played it right. Jamie is very good at playing. I wished I could play like him. The young actors were already musicians. Some play many instruments. But they never played in a band before. They found it easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural. They forgot to smile at first! The show will be in London for another year. It is very good to see.'"
