1,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—announcing your location online. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing awareness of the potential downsides of sharing everything online. The internet offers vast opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost. Is this depressing? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame—long before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students, scientists, and a few curious teens like him. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He built a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and readers were drawn to his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall's approach was clear: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was exhibitionist, his work had a beauty that some might even call art. One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared his story: he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people want to be with you, you'll be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous colleague sent her blog's address to all the vice presidents at her company, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts in online behavior call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can speak freely without consequences. Our digital lives are connected to our real lives. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: the web lets us say anything, but that doesn't mean we should."
2,"A while ago, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. How could any scientist disagree with that? Scientists can be a bit arrogant sometimes, but even the most confident physicist wouldn't claim to know everything about the universe. Still, some scientists felt the need to publicly criticize the film, using strong words like ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" Clearly, this was a movie worth watching. Yet, for the first twenty minutes or so, I couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Various scientists made harmless statements about how new discoveries were showing the universe to be much stranger than expected. It was when the film described some of these discoveries that I began to understand the controversy—discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be affected by thought. I had heard rumors before about a Japanese researcher who claimed that the shape of a water molecule could be changed just by the thoughts of people around it. However, when the movie talked about this amazing discovery, the only evidence it provided was pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy, and ugly after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing. It's straightforward, clear, and likely to make people smile and think uncritically, saying things like ""Wow, that's amazing."" Among scientists, though, the typical response has been: ""Give me a break."" I understand what they mean. Sure, the idea that water is affected by thoughts is an incredible claim with big implications. Without a clear explanation, it also suggests the possibility of new forces in the universe. But before we get too excited, it would be wise to have solid proof that the effect is real. And pretty photos of crystals, as nice as they are, just aren't enough. The real issue is that the movie's claims weren't strange enough. Consider this: water molecules have properties due to a form of energy that appears out of nowhere, linked to a force driving the expansion of the universe. And the evidence is more than just a few pretty pictures; it comes from decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. The truth is that discoveries are now being made that prove beyond doubt that, just as the film claims, the universe is far stranger than anyone could have believed. Astronomers have found that the universe is made from an unknown form of matter and is being driven by a mysterious force known as ""dark energy."" Beyond the movie, discoveries being made on a more practical level are just as amazing. Neuroscientists have found evidence that our conscious perception of events is about half a second behind reality—a delay we don't notice because our brains edit it out. Anthropologists now believe they have identified the birthplace of modern humans and how—and why—they left it to populate the world. And, completing the cosmic circle, some theorists claim to have found links between the existence of life on Earth and the fundamental design of the universe. Despite what some might say, science shows no signs of being complete. On the contrary, we seem to be further from knowing everything than ever. It is now clear that many, if not most, natural phenomena can never be understood to the level once thought possible. The concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have set limits on what we can know. This has led some of the world's leading theoretical physicists to try to create the so-called Theory of Everything, which will sum up all the forces and particles of the universe in a single equation. Theories aside, many of us believe the universe is best summed up in a single word: incredible."
3,"Text: 'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is like planting a garden. These two activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn a brilliant gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and vice versa. The two types of writing might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. After beginning my career with two short novels in 1975, I started writing short stories from 1984 to 1985. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. I felt my fictional world expand. Readers seemed to appreciate this other side of me as a writer. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can be endless). It’s not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That’s it. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I’ll make it through. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small things – an idea, a word, an image. It’s often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn’t work out, you just accept it and move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t always write masterpieces. I find this comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like soft shadows I’ve set out in the world, faint footprints I’ve left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,"Science, at its core, can be as abstract as philosophy or as practical as curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats to our existence. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, from small atoms to the immense cosmos. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even frauds. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, its dangers are misunderstood, and its importance is both overestimated and underestimated. The mistakes of science and scientists are sometimes ignored or exaggerated. The journey to explain the universe is full of conflict. Old theories are often changed or replaced, and new ideas are initially mocked but later become accepted truths. The battle between old and new ideas is rarely graceful. Scientists can be driven by jealousy and anger. The history of science is marked by conflict. This book looks at science as a series of ideas that have changed not just science but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book focuses on ideas, appreciating their beauty and questioning them. Science is always changing. Scientists constantly challenge each other's explanations. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they lead to major shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned basic assumptions, leading us to a complex understanding where observing the universe affects it. Some people see the changing nature of science as a sign that it can't fully explain the universe. However, scientific changes often improve our ability to understand and predict nature. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science often makes mistakes but continues to progress. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was little left to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, the electron, quantum mechanics, relativity, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some claim we are close to a ""theory of everything"" that explains the universe. Maybe. Science is not just an intellectual activity. In the last two centuries, we have become not just observers but also controllers of nature. Sometimes, we have disrupted nature in ways we didn't understand. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists cannot ignore scientific advances that will shape the world their children will live in and the kind of children they will have. Science is now part of how humanity plans and controls its future. Deciding the future is not just for philosophers. These decisions can affect national budgets, the health of future generations, and even the survival of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing, or even decreased in some cases. This raised new doubts about the long-term future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investment decisions, with his company losing faith in 'the power of the printed word'. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will 'kill' print books keeps coming up. Whether people are predicting or dismissing this idea, the potential disappearance of the book continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a struggle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium 'killing' another often follows the introduction of new technologies. Even before digital technologies, critics predicted the end of existing media. For example, after television was invented, many thought radio would die. But radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and on factory floors. The idea of the disappearing book isn't new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some feared the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. It's no surprise that the idea of the death of the book appears during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our hopes and fears about technological change. To understand why these reactions are common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we develop close bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it doesn't just mean economic and social change. It also means adjusting our bond with something that is part of our daily life. As technology advances, we often long for what we used to know but no longer have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older form. The same happened with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a new appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those who worry about the disappearance of print books. Yet, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to be an appealing story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we make sense of change is by using familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings. Easy to remember and share, the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world – and ultimately, ourselves."
6,"For a year and a half, almost every weekday morning, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and wrote about how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By exploring the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, showing them as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward."" This book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the final product; it focuses on the process rather than the meaning. It’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something of your inner self. My book addresses questions I face in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to dedicate yourself entirely to a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t claim to answer these questions definitively, but I provide examples of how various successful people have dealt with similar challenges. I wanted to show how big creative visions translate into small daily actions and how working habits influence the work itself. The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it’s really about routines. A routine might seem ordinary, but it can be a well-tuned system for using limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine helps focus mental energy and keeps moods in check. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself struggled with procrastination and couldn’t stick to a regular schedule. This book was born from my own procrastination. One Sunday, instead of writing a story due the next day, I was tidying my office and making coffee. As a morning person, I’m focused early in the day but less so after lunch. To feel better about this, I searched online for other writers’ schedules. I found them entertaining and thought someone should collect these stories, leading to my Daily Routines blog and now this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of routines I found in biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more thoroughly, keeping the original’s brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources. This book wouldn’t have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I’ve documented all my sources in the Notes section, which can guide further reading."
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of an increase in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, decided that their planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. On a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From that moment, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of his university studies, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was interested in the earliest times, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied ancient, delicate creatures found in grey rocks. When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job, especially in the type of institution he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving something doesn't always mean getting it. When an Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had an argument with his wife, crashed his car, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and the professor who replaced him disliked the original professor's favorite candidate. This led to Howard getting the job. Howard was surprised by the unexpected support from someone he didn't know and was grateful until a colleague explained what really happened. Howard was only a little disappointed. It would have been nice to think he was the best candidate or that he impressed everyone with his skills and personality. But by then, the important thing was that he had the job and could do the work he loved. He often thought about how his professional life was orderly, where he could plan and follow a course of action, unlike the chaos of personal life. Sometimes, strangers can change your life, as Howard found out when his briefcase, with notes for a lecture, was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, Howard went back to the college, postponed the lecture, and reported the theft. He then had coffee with a colleague and a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This is how Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that needed study, which would become his biggest challenge and secure his career. If not for the theft, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. Within half an hour, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they look like maggots, they have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the many challenges Spence and his team are working on. Through his research on how our senses combine to create our perception of flavor, Spence is quietly but significantly influencing what we eat and drink. This ranges from the products of large food companies (he is on the scientific advisory board of a well-known multinational and receives funding from another) to the menus of top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues, through a field informally known as gastrophysics, have studied in detail how we experience food and drink. Factors like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color, texture, and weight of plates and cutlery, and background noise all affect taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting insights for anyone who enjoys eating. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant tends to enjoy their meal the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence's lab in Oxford is quite basic. ""Low-tech, paper and drawing pin stuff,"" he admits. There are soundproof booths that look like large safes, and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. Historically, research funded by industry was seen in universities as ""what you do if you can't do proper science."" But now, since the government requires universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research is seen as beneficial. Spence is currently helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often due to government regulations. He notes that it's in their interest to help customers live longer. Surprisingly, many companies make these reductions quietly, so consumers don't notice the change. ""Research shows that when you tell people what you're doing, they focus on the taste and don't like it as much,"" he says. Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a major food producer. ""At the time, people thought: 'Science and food – that's horrible,' although most food is scientific. Who better to change that mindset than Heston?"" Through Blumenthal's work with Spence, who was studying the effects of sound on flavor, the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish was created at Blumenthal's five-star restaurant. Interestingly, Spence mentions that the Italian futurists, an early 20th-century art movement, were ""doing sounds of croaking frogs with frogs legs a century ago,"" but it didn't become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. This includes his recent findings that high-pitched music enhances sweetness, while low-pitched and brassy sounds make food taste bitter. ""It's always surprising when shapes affect taste, or when a tune can impact how you perceive a flavor,"" he says. An airline will soon match music with food served to passengers. Last year, a well-known brand released a smartphone app that played a concerto while your ice cream softens, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says happens too often. One might wonder what dinner parties are like at Spence's home. There was a time they ate rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery, and another when they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. ""We've had dinner parties with a tone generator, headphones, and 10 different drinks lined up to see if they have different pitches."" Home, sweet shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of the lab for Spence."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, false facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows. Smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is an illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly moving from one task to another, worried something will fall. Even though we think we are getting a lot done, multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause mental fog. Multitasking creates a craving for new stimulation, distracting the brain. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain we need to focus, is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask can harm our cognitive performance. Glenn Wilson, a former professor of psychology, calls it info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while an email is unread in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. Wilson showed that the mental losses from multitasking are greater than those from fatigue. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to retrieve. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is hard on our brains. Small decisions use the same mental resources as big ones, leading to poor decisions. In discussions with business leaders and scientists, email is often mentioned as a problem. It is not about email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is not far from the truth. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other things done."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being spiteful? In caves in the US, female bats help unrelated fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right birthing position. Are they being caring? Fifty years ago, these questions would have been seen as irrelevant. Animals had behaviors, these behaviors produced measurable outcomes, and science recorded those outcomes. The idea that animals have consciousness, feelings, and moral systems was considered sentimental. But recently, this has partially changed. Research into the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has led to the exploration of animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". It has started a debate that may never be solved by science: can animals be said to have consciousness? This debate leads to another one: not about consciousness, but conscience – a person’s moral sense of right and wrong. In a recent experiment with cows that had to open a locked gate to get food, it was found that those who opened the gate themselves showed more pleasure – by jumping and kicking their legs – than those who had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does it mean for the production and consumption of beef? The observations may not be disputed, but their interpretation is. According to Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" the only consistent response to the new research is to stop eating meat. He believes humanity is on the verge of a great ethical revolution. According to Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, we should at least re-evaluate our view of animal cognition. He believes that animals do have a theory of mind, but it’s simpler than ours. Professor Euan MacPhail suggests we should stop anthropomorphizing. The three may never agree because the issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Given that defining consciousness is nearly impossible, can we ever know, in the words of philosopher Thomas Nagel, what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an experiment he did that seems to show starlings – a type of bird – can get depressed. In a study at Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. Half were in luxurious cages, with plenty of space and water. The other half were in small, barren cages. Initially, both groups were fed tasty worms from one box and unpleasant worms from another, and soon learned to take only from the tasty box. But later, when offered only unpleasant worms, only the birds in luxurious cages would eat. It seemed, or at least Balcombe concluded, that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic about life. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. ‘We look back with horror on an era of racism,’ he says. ‘Our view about animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.’ If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him as extreme. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his view. Manning has written a textbook, ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour."" ‘What we are seeing is a pendulum swing,’ he says. ‘At the turn of the 20th century, some assumed animals thought like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are going the other way. But it is a contentious subject, and you want to avoid the sound of academics with personal grievances and strong opinions.’"
11,"Critical thinking, also known as analytical thinking, is a way to understand what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., notes that while technology helps us store and process information, it might also change how we solve complex problems, making deep thinking harder. He mentions that we are often overwhelmed by poor but appealing ideas and opinions, which can weaken our reasoning. Despite having more data, our thinking quality hasn't improved much. The National Endowment for the Arts reports a decline in literary reading, which some, like Patricia Greenfield, believe affects critical thinking. She suggests that focusing more on visual media and multitasking reduces our ability to concentrate on one thing. However, there is no clear answer yet on how technology impacts critical thinking. Technology's influence is complex, and its effects vary. For instance, a computer game might help or hinder critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis skills, but too many hyperlinks can disrupt deeper thought. Greenfield, who studied over 50 research papers, says that while reading boosts imagination and critical thinking, visual media can enhance some information processing skills. Yet, most visual media don't allow time for reflection or imagination, leading to underachievement, especially in younger people. Society's view of technology affects how it perceives critical thinking. This is evident in the debate over video games and learning. James Paul Gee argues that video games, often seen as unhealthy, can be good learning tools. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in realistic settings. They allow players to explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise. As reading and math scores drop in the digital age, it's important to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford, when not writing about how we should live, works as a motorcycle mechanic. He chose this job after becoming unhappy with office work and his role in social policy institutions. His first book praised the benefits of manual work, while his latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for it while shopping, noticing ads on a credit card machine during a short delay. Crawford realized that these constant demands on our attention are hard to avoid. What we want to focus on is personal, but we are often unaware of what distracts us. It's becoming harder to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, we isolate ourselves and avoid simple interactions like chatting with strangers. Crawford notes that we experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can manipulate us and take over our desires. Many people share his concerns. For example, office workers complain about emails but spend their free time on them. Studies show our attention drifts if a phone is visible, a common experience for those distracted at dinner by their phones. There's no scientific proof yet that our attention spans have changed, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. While it seems like a technological issue, Crawford believes technology just amplifies our self-focus. With constant choices, our self-control is challenged, affecting social interactions. We prefer texting friends to avoid real conversations. By interacting with representations of people instead of real people, we risk losing something important in society. Screens are only part of the issue. Crawford uses his gym as an example. It used to have one music player for everyone, which could cause tension. Now, people use earbuds to listen to their own music, making the gym less social. Real connections often happen through resolving conflicts, like differing music tastes. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, regulate noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he recommends engaging in skilled activities to connect with the world meaningfully. He mentions cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers as examples of people who deal with real-world challenges. These roles require good judgment and managing others in the same space. Engaging with the world this way makes artificial experiences seem less appealing. This doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but it's important to use your judgment. Besides job satisfaction, focusing on one thing helps you concentrate better on other things."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, this question is answered quickly. However, when you are a philosopher, like me, it is a bit more complicated. Calling yourself a philosopher can sound pretentious. Saying you study or teach philosophy is fine, but claiming to be a philosopher might seem like you are claiming special knowledge. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why does this stereotype exist? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) said that a life of contemplation, or a philosophical life, was the best. Few modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked with thinking deeply. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just accepting cultural norms is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make decisions. But living an examined life doesn’t mean reading many philosophical books or spending all your time thinking. It means looking closely at everyday experiences to see if they are important. It doesn’t mean living like a wise person away from society. In fact, the examined life is practical and involves sharing knowledge, which is important for a good life. Another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from real life, especially for people without formal training. This is partly because of university funding and the focus on expensive academic journals. Philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. For most people, philosophy can seem disconnected from reality. If philosophers once challenged this view, many have stopped. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy have become focused on specific debates, explaining them to non-experts is difficult. Philosophy, in some cases, has withdrawn from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about evaluating human actions. But recently, I feel this title doesn’t fully describe my work. Ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. This is a new development in philosophy: ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often discuss them. However, philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start with whether illegally downloading films is unethical (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people examine the actions and beliefs that shape their lives. Sometimes this confirms what we know; other times, it shows our beliefs are hard to justify. By examining these ideas, we benefit everyone."""
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies, gourmands, and chefs, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. Historically, though, philosophers have often used food as a way to talk about other ideas. When philosophers discussed eating, it was usually a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Sometimes, philosophical discussions seem to be about food, but they actually explore other, loosely related topics. An interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who promoted seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in various activities. Despite this, Epicurus's name has become linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and online recipe sites, likely because these businesses hope to gain credibility by associating with a famous philosopher. Food is inherently social and cultural. It comes from historical contexts and is shared with our communities, which provide dining companions and the systems for growing and distributing food. We interact with food more often and in more essential ways than any other commodity, making it a clear topic for philosophical inquiry. Once food is prepared, critics start discussing and writing about it. But why do they have such a special status? One philosopher noted that tasting food is not a unique skill; rather, influential food critics are just better at describing tastes. Philosophically, the mechanisms of taste perception have not been studied much, as most research has focused on vision. This should change. Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We often call paintings or symphonies beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers argue that with modern gastronomy, food deserves a place in aesthetic discussions like sculpture or poetry. However, food is consumed and disappears when enjoyed, unlike art or music, which last over time. Aesthetic objects should persist, so it's incorrect to consider food as having aesthetic value. There are many ethical questions related to food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often reflect our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices, which is a valid area of study. Another topic is the difference between cooking at home and in restaurants. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of personal relationships. In home kitchens, everyone shares food and companionship. Professional cooks, however, have responsibilities to their employers and the food itself. Their kitchens are not open to everyone, only to qualified people, and their relationships are professional. A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food and dining can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways: by appreciating others' food and by forming personal connections through shared meals, a practice with a long history in diplomacy. The essay is filled with examples and stories that make this aspect of food philosophy engaging for readers.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were no longer fun or challenging, so he started thinking about how they could change. Could they have a storyline? Could choices made in one game affect the next? He changed a classic board game called Risk to make a new version: Risk Legacy. Unlike older board games, decisions in this game had lasting effects. Players might have to tear up cards, mark the board, or open packets with new rules at key moments. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and long-standing rivalries become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’ 

Daviau was then asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was praised, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was the first game not based on an earlier version. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players become explorers in a new world. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. To do this, they use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. ‘It takes a lot of time,’ he said. ‘The first few games might be great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.’

Legacy games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a niche interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is different and I think it’s good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks many rules. I thought it would be popular with only a few people. I thought I’d be known for this unusual project.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He sees it as a major advance in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play, and you get that all the time with legacy games.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the unfolding adventure was more important than worries about the game’s lifespan. ‘At first, there was worry about changing and basically ruining your board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It adds a story element like in video games.’ The legacy format draws from video games and the demand for episodic entertainment from popular TV series. In college, Daviau wanted to be a TV writer but moved to advertising and then game design. Still, he loved telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how you want it to end and have a good idea of where to start,’ he said. ‘But it’s not enough to just have an outline.’

While Daviau feels a sense of ownership, he is interested in seeing where others take the idea. But he also downplays its importance. He thinks gamers will soon ask: ‘What’s next?’ Colby Dauch, studio manager for SeaFall’s publisher, is less sure. For him, the legacy format has been eye-opening. ‘It’s the kind of idea that changes how you think about what a board game can be.’"
16,"One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. This story, which sounds like a children's movie, was widely shared online. Stories like this, involving animals such as rats and llamas, are fun because they let us imagine animals as being like us. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very intelligent despite looking so different from humans. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways.

People often think that giving animals human traits is unscientific. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, argues that the real problem is ""anthropodenial""—the refusal to see human-like traits in animals. He has studied animal behavior for decades and found that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, being self-aware, and understanding others' motives. In other words, animals are smarter than we often think.

In the past, people believed animals had complex minds. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the nineteenth century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said that the difference between human and animal minds is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines that responded to stimuli or as robots with instincts. People who thought animals had inner lives were considered unscientific. This view coincided with humans destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.

Fortunately, de Waal believes we are now recognizing that animal intelligence is on the same spectrum as human intelligence. He notes that recent decades have brought a lot of new knowledge about animals, shared widely on the internet. The best tests of animal intelligence consider a species' unique traits. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts.

In her book ""The Soul of an Octopus,"" naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might judge us on how many color patterns we can make on our skin. Seeing us fail, they might think we are not very smart.

De Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape. While octopuses have escaped before, he doubts Inky knew how to find a drain leading to the ocean. However, he acknowledges that viral stories can increase appreciation for animal intelligence. He once tested whether capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the cucumber-receiving monkeys became upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video clip of the experiment convinced more people of the findings. This shows the unique nature of the human mind."
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialisation. Robots have been used in car manufacturing for many years, but experts now predict a big increase in their use across various industries. Many people think robots will take over most jobs in the next 50 years, but they also believe their own jobs will remain unchanged. This is unlikely, as robotic automation will affect every industry soon. For instance, the Australian company Fastbrick Robotics has created a robot, the Hadrian X, that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a task that would take two human workers much longer. In San Francisco, Simbe Robotics introduced Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check if products are stocked and priced correctly. Supporters of robotic automation point out that robots still need humans to service and program them, which could create new skilled jobs. However, critics warn that we should not ignore the importance of human interaction at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robotics is changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will create laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but there will be a shortage of skilled workers. Zhang suggests that people should retrain to adapt to these changes, as relying on the government to protect jobs is not realistic. New developments in robotics will lead to robots that can live with us at home and interact with us in advanced ways, similar to those in science fiction. This presents opportunities for companies but also challenges, such as creating new safety and privacy regulations. With many jobs at risk, education is crucial to prepare for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, reportedly answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest with, ""Because it’s there."" The reporter's question reflected a common curiosity: why would anyone engage in such a dangerous and seemingly pointless activity? Mallory's answer might inspire some to pursue their dreams, challenging certain people to face the unknown. Its true value, however, lies in its simplicity, suggesting that climbing might be about adventure and fun. 

An important essay on climbing is ‘Games that Climbers Play’ (1967) by Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores. He identified seven different climbing activities, or ‘games’, ranging from bouldering to climbing Himalayan peaks, each with its own rules. He argued that the style of climbing, such as using more or less equipment, should follow the rules of the specific game. Over the years, this approach has become central to climbing discussions in the West, seen in climbing magazines and debates. 

For many climbers, the love of climbing comes from the sense of freedom it provides. Yet, climbing can also be restrictive, like being stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and confining. However, the limited choices in climbing can bring a simplicity that is a form of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen, in a recent essay, suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He explores an evolutionary perspective, proposing that climbing is in our genes. It is natural for humans to take on challenges and test limits, even with risks. Thus, the joy of climbing is more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor, in another essay, argues that climbing helps develop virtues like courage, humility, and respect for the environment. While not all climbers show these virtues, Treanor believes they are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing, therefore, has practical value, helping develop traits that are beneficial in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who do not rely on others or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Expert climbers Ebert and Robinson stirred controversy by claiming that independent climbs, which are harder or riskier, deserve more recognition than those done with large teams or artificial aids like bottled oxygen. Their essay may have encouraged some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Exploring climbing beyond the Western perspective, climbers often report being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone."" The physical effort, active meditation, and intuitive problem-solving in climbing are similar to Zen techniques for achieving peace of mind. This offers another perspective on why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known as an intellectual and sometimes serious person who focused on European piano music. He wrote and performed a lot but rarely taught. Those close to him saw a playful side, but it was not often shown in his concerts. His life was a disciplined cycle of study, travel, and performance. Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take the request seriously. He had taught very few students and saw no reason to start now. He quoted another famous pianist: ‘You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ However, something about the boy, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played remarkably well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital where he played beautifully. Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that guided the listener from the first to the last note, which is rare in musicians. As Brendel steps back from the public eye, Kit is slowly entering it, with Brendel cautious about the young man burning out early. Kit, now 19, is always busy outside of lessons—learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under the watchful eye of his mother. He also composes music. Brendel says, ‘Learning to read music is helped by trying to write it yourself. Kit has a phenomenal memory and is an excellent sight reader. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and to me when I explain something. He not only understands but can do it. When I tell him something about a piece, he applies it throughout the piece.’ Brendel stops himself and looks serious. ‘I don’t want to raise expectations. I get upset when newspapers do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century, which is harmful. With talented young players, they can play some things very well, but others need more time and experience. It would be harmful if a critic expected perfection.’ Now at 80, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He explains, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them but continued because there was more to do. Although I don’t have the physical strength now, my mind is active with pieces I’ve never played. I don’t perform now, but it’s a nice new phase in my life.’"
20,"When I was a child, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden wasn’t in a dirty city. It was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds singing in the trees. I believed all gardens were like this – places of escape, peace, and solitude. Grandad’s garden wasn’t special in terms of features. He didn’t have a greenhouse, unlike some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass had broken.

At home, my father was often quiet and reserved. He wasn’t without humor, though. Silly things amused him, and he liked using certain phrases, like ‘It’s immaterial to me’. He probably felt disappointed that he hadn’t achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, a job he wasn’t passionate about. He wasn’t very ambitious, although he and my mother once considered moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was very skilled around the house, making things like bookshelves and cupboards.

My parents only moved house once in their married life, but my mother often changed the furniture. Just when you got used to one chair, another would appear. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I did like the two brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; lessons were for my sister. When I asked my mother later why I wasn’t given the chance, she simply said, ‘You’d never have practiced’.

Given the choice between moors, woods, or river, I usually chose the river. I could escape into another world there. With a fishing net and old sandals, I’d walk along the riverbank, looking for a spot to take off my sandals and search for fish to catch with my net. After failing to keep them alive at home, I’d return them to the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father said, ‘There’s a vacancy for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ In that moment, Dad went against his usual thinking. He might have preferred me to become a carpenter, but I like to think he believed things might work out if I stuck with it. Maybe I’m fooling myself, but I prefer to believe that deep down, even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw my passion for it."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I do the same. An Atlantic storm threatens to blow us off the cliff and into the ocean 120 meters below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes over, and his owner gently strokes him. Despite the strong wind, MacEwen is comfortable here on his island, where he feels at home. He points out the nearby islands: ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds pouring rain on Rum’s mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says, ‘I have sheep to move,’ as rain approaches. We head down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Volcanic Muck is three km long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Herding the sheep interrupts our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is circling the sheep but not doing it well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen calls, meaning the dog should circle to the right. Tie doesn’t listen and goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, disappointed. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mainly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby enjoy that their two boys can explore the island freely and sail dinghies in the summer. ‘They go out and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But island life has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I manage without electricity and mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck seems wonderfully unexpected. Today’s boat brings groceries and three musicians, who perform a concert in the island’s tearoom. The islanders enjoy the music, tapping their boots in time. That night, by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay from a newspaper ad, without seeing it. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know anything about farming? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, tasting incredibly good. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to another island. In the past two months, many ferries were canceled due to high seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I’ll be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, phone or no phone, is what I secretly hope for."
22,"The game design industry was once mainly for computer scientists and self-taught individuals, with few entry paths. It was often seen as just a hobby for young people, but now it's taken seriously. Industry experts aren't surprised by this change. Creating video game spin-offs for new movies requires large teams and months of hard work. Like many industries, it's hard to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says it's tough to make progress in big companies or influence major games. However, the industry needs more game designers, not just directors but also those who design systems and set pieces.

How can you enter this competitive field? While many companies prefer a computer science degree, Jim believes the key is to make games. The tools are available, and you need to create something to get a job or succeed independently. Game design is more a lifestyle than a job, like any creative work.

Another expert, John Field, agrees but adds that it's more complex. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry's demands. Even fewer have the creativity, technical skills, vision, and business sense needed. Can you succeed alone? It's difficult, says John, but a good postgraduate course can help by offering support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all entertainment media and have a strong interest in arts and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but realize games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and understand the growing diversity of the medium. Networking is also important to advance in the industry.

The stereotype of a teenage boy playing video games is outdated. Now, gaming is seen as a mature medium that captures our attention. Families play together on interactive consoles, and smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. Games are popular with large audiences and are a great way to learn, offering many opportunities."
23,"Text: 'Since I was a child, all I’ve ever wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me, and I’m thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy, always telling him what he couldn’t do. My friend could have been a good player, but he lost interest and never played football again. I’m glad that didn’t happen to me, but I know it could have. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it’s not. I’ve practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. Only by practicing can you score the spectacular goals that are so exciting. The best players in the world, who have great natural talent, wouldn’t have achieved what they have without years of practice. Sometimes you see young players crashing into each other, but I was taught technique. When I teach kids, the most important thing I try to share is to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now that getting a good education is important, but back then, football was all I thought about. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I don’t want it to be like that for my son. We’re already trying to read him books even though he’s too young to sit still for long. I hope the fact that he usually wants to kick them around doesn’t mean he takes after me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so some of us younger players could join the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He didn’t gather us and say, ‘This is your big chance,’ but we all knew it was. Although I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids’. That made us realize how much we had to do. You always have some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite what he said. I rely on close friends and family a lot. But having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people sometimes say to me, ‘I can’t believe you let your mother keep working.’ Of course, I’ve helped my parents financially. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong individuals and would be offended by the idea that they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn’t earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. On the other hand, it makes me happy to use my money to make things easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people think, but that doesn’t give me all the answers. After I stop playing, I think I’ll take a year off or maybe even longer, doing things I haven’t been able to do all these years. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can’t do that now because if I broke a leg skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured.'"
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. Out of desperation, he offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father couldn’t write anything sellable in Los Angeles, and Sam was worried about losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn’t popular with day-trippers. The road was uninviting, and the charming resort of La Carmella was nearby, where people with some money preferred to stay. Only those who were broke or loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But with the hot weather, the place became crowded. After months of being almost alone, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to meet a script deadline and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty, for company. We didn’t have a dog when we first moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to adopt us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I gave him water, and my father half-heartedly threw a boot at him. Rusty knew he was welcome and stayed. I asked my father who Rusty might belong to, and he said, ‘He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also loved swimming and always joined me, even though I was faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. One surfer stood out with her graceful style. She finished for the day and came over to talk. She asked why I didn’t join them, and I said I didn’t have a surfboard or money. She noticed I was British and asked if I was visiting. I told her I lived there and that my father was writing a film script. She asked if she knew him, and when I said his name, Rufus Marsh, she recognized it from his novel, Tall as the Morning. She looked at me with new interest, as people always did when they heard about the book."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long queue at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie, who often gave travel advice, had told her to arrive late to avoid waiting. However, this advice was wrong, as there was a delay due to a computer system breakdown. The passengers were becoming frustrated because they had paid a lot for this cruise, hoping for a luxurious experience. Violet felt like leaving, especially after realizing she had lost her phone. This was more troubling than the long wait because all her important contacts were stored in it. She borrowed a phone from a friendly couple behind her to call her son Harry, asking him to check with her neighbor Kristina if the phone was at her flat. If it wasn't there, she would have trouble contacting people in New York. Harry often thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding but forgetful. Finally, the queue moved, and Violet handed over her travel documents. Her spirits dropped further when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be grand. She took the elevator, crowded with tired passengers, to the twelfth floor. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had requested, which she had paid extra for to ensure a view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he discovered 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing striking images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. On a recent morning, Maloof stood among these items, realizing he had stumbled upon something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I didn’t know what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily sold it all to someone else.’ For some time, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been piecing together Maier’s life story. They contacted local families who employed her as a nanny and spoke with employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit eccentric, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘On her day off, she’d leave with her camera in the morning and return late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband employed Maier to care for his daughter. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier was knowledgeable about theater and movies. Although not very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed passionate about her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist who followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anything stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was for commercial purposes. Her images often focus on women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract subjects. ‘What’s fascinating about Vivian is the number of interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated or did she borrow ideas from others?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her architectural photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I grew as a photographer and revisited her work, I realized the cityscapes weren’t what mattered to her. It was the people, the street scenes, the overall composition,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I had something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.’"
27,"When a novel is called ambitious, it often hints at some failure. This is not the case with Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when the book's success had made her very famous, but she seemed calm, especially since she was still in her twenties. She had just arrived from Germany and was flying back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel through the glass. The official looked at it and asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. A series of crimes have occurred, and a group of 12 men has gathered to solve them. The plot becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past offered more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. At over 800 pages, it is ‘big by necessity’ because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters ‘a decent show’. When I ask how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she answers modestly. ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. There’s a very familial feeling at home, I got a lot of back pats from other people’s grandmas.’ Then she adds, carefully: ‘What is annoying is when people assume that what I’m trying to do in the book is not a philosophical effort.’ ‘I had the idea to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part was half the length of the one before it,’ said Catton. It literally speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters whether the reader notices these things. ‘I wanted to create a book with structural patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could look into the book and see them.’ Despite the experimental structure, The Luminaries remains an exciting murder mystery with an engaging plot. Surprisingly, she says she didn’t plan it all out beforehand. ‘I would try to write myself into a corner, and then see how imaginative I could be in writing myself out of this impossible situation.’ It’s clear she also wanted to make the book fun for the reader. We also talk about her love of TV drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue, I ask if she might be interested in screenwriting. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says. Her conversation is full of enthusiasm, with a low, conspiratorial laugh. She lights up when talking about her craft and New Zealand. ‘I always notice when I come to Britain how much the landscape of my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to very populated areas, to have that saturation of other human beings.’ But for now, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I am not alone in hoping it provides her with the inspiration she needs for many other novels."
28,"As a child, Jonny Kinkead loved using tools in his dad’s garage and playing with a guitar. These two interests have been his career for the last forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still fascinated by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood create such a beautiful sound? And how do different types of wood make different sounds? It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar at eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a holiday job and save up for one,’ he says. ‘But I believed if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and woods affected the sound and how to put them together.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been doing similar things with other items. ‘We designed model boats and planes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use saws, sharpen chisels, and things like that. I’d also been customizing and repairing instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he hadn’t thought of a career in guitar-making. ‘I was also interested in painting and sculpture,’ he says. After finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea at the time,’ he remembers. However, halfway through the course, he dropped out. ‘I was too individualistic for it,’ he says. ‘But I left with a clearer idea of what I wanted to do. I was still into sculpture, but I realized that guitar-making is a type of sculpture – one that involves shaping sound. And I thought it might be more practical than pure art because you’re making things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only covered the cost of materials, but as he became known as one of the best guitar-makers, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just getting by’. He admits he can’t make more than ten guitars a year, which limits his income. In the early years, he worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals most weekends to get musicians to try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments – when musicians asked, he didn’t have an answer because it didn’t come naturally to him. Jonny believes it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the only good acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as authentic, even though we’ve always had good instrument-making courses and the skills have stayed the same. But now our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says valuable techniques can be learned in the classroom, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take the courses available. However, he also believes there’s no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see where people have succeeded or failed, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you’re taught by someone else, you only learn one way, but if you’re self-taught, like I was, you learn everything.’"
29,"Text: 'Any discussion about English conversation must start with the weather. This is a tradition, and like many writers on Englishness, I will quote the famous comment by the eighteenth-century diarist Dr. Johnson: ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This observation is still true today, just as it was over two hundred years ago. However, many commentators stop here or try to explain the English ‘obsession’ with the weather but fail. They fail because they wrongly assume that our conversations about the weather are actually about the weather itself. They think English people talk about the weather because they are interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson notes that the English weather is not very exciting, so the national obsession with it is hard to understand: ‘To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it. All those phenomena that elsewhere give nature excitement and danger – tornadoes, monsoons, blizzards, hailstorms – are almost unknown in the British Isles.’ The English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson and argues that English weather is interesting. ‘Bryson misses the point. The English interest in the weather is not about deep emotion – like the English countryside, it is mostly undramatic. The interest is in its uncertainty…one thing you can say about England with certainty is that it has a lot of weather. It may not have tropical cyclones, but living at the edge of an ocean and a continent means you can never be sure what you will get.’ My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the point. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather: English weather-talk is a kind of code, developed to help English people overcome their natural shyness and talk to each other. Everyone knows that ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’, ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ and similar phrases are not requests for weather information: they are greetings, conversation starters, or fillers. English weather-talk is like ‘grooming talk’ – similar to ‘social grooming’ among monkeys and apes, who groom each other’s fur to bond socially. There are specific situations where weather-talk is used. Some writers say the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is not true: there are three specific situations where weather-talk is used. It can be a simple greeting, an ice-breaker leading to other topics, or a ‘default’ topic when other conversations dry up. This does allow for a lot of weather-talk, so outsiders think English people talk about little else. An English conversation may start with a weather-talk greeting, move to more weather-talk as an ice-breaker, and then return to weather-talk at regular intervals. It is easy to see why people from other countries, and even many English commentators, think English people are obsessed with the weather.'"
30,"Alice Leader stood in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an impressive engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 meters high nearly 1900 years ago. The students were already interested, as they had chosen this trip over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. However, they were curious about why the Wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not satisfying. Unable to find a suitable historical novel to provide context and human interest about life at the Wall during Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching after 31 years, Alice began a new career as an author in 2001. Although she had a successful teaching career, Alice felt she was taking a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting; it’s a performance every day and physically demanding. Writing is exciting and unnerving, but not as exhausting. My former colleagues envy me because I still connect with children through my fiction.’ Alice’s main goal for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s children’s fiction. ‘Many adolescent books today focus on negative experiences. They are well written,’ she quickly adds, ‘but often dark or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’ Alice always tried to teach English and History together, like lessons about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy, driven by her love for children. ‘I’m interested in the moment when a child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because then the challenge is on. It’s up to me to make it work.’ She sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the idea also came from the ‘empty nest’ as her two sons were leaving home, and a suggestion from her head teacher to attend a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday on a course I didn’t think was necessary.’ Before being accepted on the course, she had to send her best piece of fiction, a requirement she learned about just days before leaving. ‘I sat at the computer and invented a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, other students reviewed her work, gave excellent feedback, and suggested she publish it. With 8,000 report cards as her only writing experience besides that story, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. It helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his help in editing the novel was crucial. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve written – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, he suggests different words. My instinct is to keep adding scenes. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,"To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to participate in a unique race. The race would pit man against car and brother against brother. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same point. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, while Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. 

‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said as they stood at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before; it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views, and it’s very cold right now, so I’ll be able to stay warm in the car.’ Alistair was also eager, but unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, he was dressed in full winter cycling gear. The cold didn’t affect his confidence. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’

The race began at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, about 350 meters up. This was no problem for the car, but Alistair’s first couple of miles involved a 25 percent incline, making it challenging from the start. After a quick handshake, they were off. Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across the countryside to Fleet Moss. Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first?

Jonny’s early confidence was quickly shaken. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first obstacle: a giant tractor moving out of a field and onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all because of this farmer!’ After tense moments, the tractor was out of the way, and Jonny was back on track, driving into the morning mist.

Meanwhile, Alistair was struggling with the slope. Just a couple of miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Bemused sheep watched as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the summit. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out, he had a chance to show his skills. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair picked up speed.

In the car, Jonny faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have been around since before cars were invented, and the roads connecting them were not made for speed. Jonny tried to navigate another narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream on the road. Once clear of the last village, the car was on a straight path to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was racing across his last field and back onto the road, approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. Finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ He raised his arms in victory. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car pulled up, and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said, disappointed. ‘I’m gutted.’"
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. And of every shot after that. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, the respectful crowds, all combine to enclose and cushion you from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hardest to focus only on the contest and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but as if from far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people around the arena, watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused I don’t feel that millions are watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my lifelong coach, taught me early on that this was the biggest tournament. By age 14, I was telling my friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The 2006 defeat wasn’t so hard. I was just happy and grateful that, at twenty, I’d made it that far. Federer beat me easily, more easily than if I’d believed in myself more. But losing in 2007 left me devastated. I knew I could have done better; it wasn’t my ability or game quality that failed, but my mind. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and waste it. Toni, the toughest coach, usually never comforts me; he criticizes me even when I win. It shows how upset I was that he broke his habit and told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might have been my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete’s career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more, and I let a big one pass in 2007. Toni couldn’t ease my grief. Yet he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I’d learned from that defeat; that this time, my mind would not fail. The best sign that my mind was ready was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family, friends, and team members the night before the final, at the house we rent when I play at Wimbledon, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t forbid them from mentioning it, but they knew that, whatever else I talked about, I was already playing the match in my mind. From then until the start of play, that space was mine alone.'"
33,"A young, idealistic Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in April 1957. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ""I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood."" She spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society helped make her famous by producing articles and TV documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children's books and the 1971 bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man,"" translated into 47 languages.

Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly second only to Marie Curie. However, her fame might have overshadowed her real achievements. Many articles and books about her life are often sentimental and limited in scope. They portray her as an adventurous girl, a privileged woman dreaming of life with wild animals, or a determined feminist. These images can undervalue her true accomplishments.

Based on the number of academic references to her research, the success of her students, and the data from her 40-year study, Jane Goodall should be seen as a distinguished pioneer and the world's leading zoologist. Her main achievement is that she opened the door to understanding the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew they ate meat or used tools. We didn't realize they shared emotions with humans or had social systems like ours. We also didn't know that chimpanzee communities across Africa had different cultural traditions.

Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"" (1986), is the most authoritative work in this field, like an encyclopedia for chimpanzee research. Her long-term study in Gombe State, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements by biologist Stephen Jay Gould. Jane Goodall helped change how we study animals and how humans think about themselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives.

Even as a child, there were signs of the person Jane Goodall would become. One clear example was in the autumn of 1939 when she was five years old. One day, she disappeared, and the police were called to search for her. After a frantic search, she reappeared with straw in her hair and clothes. Her mother asked where she had been. Jane explained she wanted to know how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours to find out. This curiosity foreshadowed her future as a biologist."
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford speaks to me using the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to viewers of children’s TV and cartoons, and to people who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to pronounce many medical terms.’ Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Lots of actors, some very well-known, think they can do funny voices and, actually, many of them probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it than that. You have to bring the script to life for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley joined a drama course planning a standard acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon soundtrack. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a major part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky enough to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors are often asked to provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and endless forms, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes a range of things from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound enthusiastic about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and cheery. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a huge difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that specialize in helping voiceover artists put them together.’ She claims to have reached the top of her profession through persistence as much as natural ability. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or simply practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone considering a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is essential, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a dream job for many kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more practical careers, like becoming a tax lawyer or working in auto parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do just that. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. In my case, I had a typical cartoonist’s childhood, loving comic strips and drawing for school publications. I studied graphic design in college and, after graduating, showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was earning enough to support myself.

To become a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical barriers are low, but it’s still a tough job. No one should try to become a cartoonist unless they feel they can't do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and leaves time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t turn down work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are mostly gone. Today, cartooning is an entrepreneurial activity, meaning you have to create and sell your work. The more comfortable you are with this, the better you’ll do. I’ve seen cartoonists with average talent and great business skills succeed more than artistic geniuses who lack business sense. It surprises me how many people are afraid someone will steal their ideas, even if they’ve never sold a cartoon. Some are so worried they won’t let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a ‘c’ for ‘copyright’, circle it, and write your name and the date. But realistically, it’s more likely no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it’s not a disaster—it can be a lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of those things was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to get rid of it? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it away when a young man approached me, looking confused. ""You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?"" he asked. I said I was, already feeling a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways. In the years that followed, I often regretted my decision. Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later inside a fish. The email was from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back and used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so emotional. I would have paid anything, but his price was fair. I had forgotten my dad’s habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this story! My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s when it was popular. I loved its calming sound, but I didn’t make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn’t need to play well to be a rock star. When I got my guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I stood up, put the strap over my shoulder, and my fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t draw the chords, but my hands remembered them. My fingertips felt the pain of pressing the strings. The electric guitar isn’t really for playing alone. Now that I’m learning again, maybe I’ll form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are others like me. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!"
37,"There has been a lot of discussion about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who struggle with sleeplessness, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. Insomniacs, whom I interviewed in large numbers, will tell you that sleep is crucial for our mental, physical, and social well-being. Those who struggle the most with sleep often understand its importance the best. It's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them in these discussions. We often lose dreams when we wake up early, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep, which is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, the stage rich in dreams. Our most vivid and emotionally powerful dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more intense REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests that dreams have a purpose. When REM was discovered in 1953, many agreed with Sigmund Freud, who believed that understanding dreams was key to understanding our minds. However, later research did not support this idea, and the study of dreams shifted to their physical origins. Currently, there is little agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School shared a study showing that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than others. He concluded that dream use increases with interest in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams, as films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't teachers, software designers, and politicians also need to think creatively? Dreams, according to Stickgold, help us combine things in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new connections. Dreams might help us discover new patterns and create combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They ignore the obvious and make unexpected connections, which is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you barely remember, seems to fuel creativity. On those days, words and images come so quickly that my fingers can hardly keep up. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we interact with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, which has a beautiful sea view, there are empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading figure in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate the richness of early-20th century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Despite her talent, she doesn't keep her own work; they are sold as soon as she finishes them. Susie is in high demand and has been a copyist artist for 30 years, painting works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that even art experts can mistake them for the originals. While the originals are worth millions, her copies sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie keeps her clients' names private, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors are true art lovers, while others buy for status. One celebrity claims to own a 'Van Gogh' when it's actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. Some collectors use her copies to save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank safe. Susie is honest about her work and signs the back of her canvases. Passing off a copy as an original is illegal, and although she knows people who do it, she has never been tempted. She believes that making fakes leads to trouble. Susie isn't wealthy and has faced financial struggles, but her situation is more stable now. She used to work as an illustrator for a botanical garden after her art degree, earning very little. This experience taught her accuracy and gave her a love for plants. She advises young artists to learn to draw accurately and emphasizes the importance of study. Susie can do anything from drawing plants to copying 15th-century masterpieces and 20th-century abstract art, but she now focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. She notes that modern art is often seen as simple, but the impressionists were both quick and meticulous, making their style challenging to replicate. Despite her skills, Susie doesn't create her own original art. She believes her work is the result of years of training and provides a good living. She has tried creating her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they ended up looking like photographs. Susie is a perfectionist."
39,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur was deeply passionate about the sea and being the fastest sailor. From childhood, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a strong connection with the boats that took her around the world, working in harmony with them. On land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly longed to return to the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and workplace for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even the number of kitchen paper rolls she needed. Preparation was crucial. She proudly displayed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and medical necessities. The boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her think about how humans take what they want and move on. When I visited her office, she explained why we must act now to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find ways not to use them up."" Initially, her message was to use less, but she realized the importance of re-using. She passionately talks about reusable items like industrial carpet tiles.

For the past three years, Ellen has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says, ""but I love learning. The current situation is something I can't ignore. Sailing seemed selfish in comparison. This is about finding how my voice can be most useful. It really matters."" She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to inspire young people to create a sustainable future. ""I miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It defines who I am. At sea, you are connected to everything, focused on records, practicalities, and survival. My new message isn't as simple as saying, 'I want to be the fastest around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this work is more important than anything I've done before."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his time. As many young people spend more time on computers and video games, he hopes to inspire them to climb their own mountains or at least spend more time outdoors. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero,' and climbing Everest is just part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest points on each continent. Few people achieve this before the age of thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might complete it before he turns twenty.

I spoke to several experienced Everest climbers, and none thought taking a 13-year-old up the world's highest mountain was a good idea. They agreed a young climber might have the physical strength but doubted if a teenager would be emotionally strong enough. They also questioned if a young person could have enough experience to make good decisions and react safely during such a climb. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. 'I know that criticism is out there,' Paul says, 'but I can't waste my time with it – there's still so much to do. I think about possible problems, obviously. Karen and I weigh up the risks all the time, but we believe our own experience as climbers will help. And watching Jordan develop gives me confidence. He's becoming so strong and grown-up.'

I also wonder about Jordan's motivation. Is this just an ambitious father pushing his love of adventure too far? 'This project isn't about me trying to become famous for my son's achievements,' Paul insists. 'At first, he talked about it as something to do later in life, but when we discussed it, we thought: 'Why not now?' We talk to him regularly to make sure he hasn't lost the motivation to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

In the past, few people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting challenge. The more adventurous the record, the more interest it generates. This gives Jordan a dilemma. We may complain that achievement often replaces enjoyment in such challenges, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to engage with the media. This means blogging, doing photo shoots, and giving interviews. He has to offer something spectacular, like climbing Everest. 'And you know what?' Paul says. 'If Jordan comes home tomorrow and says he's done with mountain climbing and wants to play basketball instead, we'll shut this whole project down and go to the gym.'"
41,"When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they aren't listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they probably won't know who he is. I'm studying music at university, but even my classmates don't know much about classical music. If you don't know the composers, you probably don't own their music. The statistics for classical music are discouraging. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical album sells only 300 copies. I find this surprising. Why has interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries, declined? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the main buyers of music and concert tickets. Some teenagers do attend classical concerts, but they are few. Although I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big fan of classical music. I enjoy many styles, but my classical music collection is probably around that 3% figure. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm, with many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk, play, and think fast. Experts say we struggle to focus for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop songs also have lyrics that appeal more to teenagers than long classical pieces without words. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says classical concert audiences have grown recently. Maybe, but I doubt many teenagers are in those audiences. In my orchestra, we play classical music in various places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why more people go to classical concerts as they get older, but I do know that if your parents love something, teenagers often avoid it. Some blame schools for teenagers' lack of interest in classical music, but many kids are eager to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. They like classical music when they perform, but it's not their first choice for listening. Performing and listening have become separate activities. When we want to relax, we choose pop music."
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to the school, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the car too, but she didn’t hear Bonnie. Bonnie didn’t mind if she had heard; her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among trees on a hillside; it seemed confusing at first. Then she saw signs on a post: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" Bonnie said, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" her mother said. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path that curved between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his study, while Bonnie waited outside the door. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be thrown out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and went towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. Probably lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" Bonnie said, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was above the stall: Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They can’t be far."" The room with the riding equipment was – to Bonnie’s delight – unlocked. Focused on putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat high on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she saw. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m not joking, because I know about horses, even if I don’t know much else."" She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, a breeze brushing her cheek and making it glow. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he’d jump well."
43,"I’ve met Cody Simpson before and have always been impressed by his quiet confidence. Cody is a 15-year-old Australian who has already released several successful songs. How did a relaxed surfer end up performing on stage for thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" He remembers how it all started. ""But I was swimming every day and surfing. Those were more important to me back then; I had my life planned and was busy. I was 13, going to high school, and then I posted a few videos online."" These videos changed everything. He started by posting a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans commented online, asking for more videos. So Cody, who had recorded more at home, was happy to share them. The responses were overwhelming. Cody was also a talented swimmer. He trained hard with top coaches, focusing on his sport. But then record labels showed interest, and he faced a tough choice: stay in Australia and continue swimming, or take a big risk by signing a deal and moving with his family to the US. Cody decided to take the risk. ""It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career. Can you imagine, at 12 or 13, trying to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?"" He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people. I’m kind of the quiet kid,"" he says, remembering their shocked reactions. ""I’m very modest, and I think it’s important to be that way in this crazy world."" So Cody packed his bags and moved with his family halfway around the world, giving up one dream to try to make another come true. Although his family stays out of the spotlight and isn’t directly involved in his career, they support him from the background. Cody says it’s important to have a close group of great people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, we all have days of doubt. ""Sometimes when I’m alone, I think, ‘How did my decision affect my little brother and sister?’ My little brother is eight, travelling the world, doing school on the road; he doesn’t have a regular life,"" Cody admits. ""I worry about that sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they’re here to support and encourage me."" Success, in any career, comes from being willing to say ""yes"" to your big opportunity, even when it’s a bit scary. ""It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,"" Cody says. ""Now, to be visiting countries I never thought I’d see and playing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans – it’s like something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won’t last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, lifted a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sunlight. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the wall of sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. All last week, I had worked alongside most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing I could handle the task. Not that my grandfather noticed much. With one hand still on the curtain, I looked along the half-mile stretch of steaming black water created by the release pipe from the wood processing factory in Milltown. With fragile ice shelves on either side, the dark open patch was followed by solid ice downstream. As I took off my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river’s edge. A boy I didn’t recognize. I frowned. Unbelievably, he was trying to balance on an ice shelf along the water warmed by the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and reached for my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there – a silver chain my famous grandfather once brought back from an expedition in South America. Far better than having a famous grandfather is having this chain, which no one but him, my mom, and I know about. Plus, I have the actual diary that he kept on that journey. I keep it under my pillow and read bits of it before I fall asleep. I patted the chain again and made my way towards the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled at me as I grabbed a banana off the kitchen counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll cook up brunch after your training session. Be careful, now.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I headed down the hallway, nearly bumping into Grandpa’s tall thin frame as he stepped out of his bedroom. ‘Can’t you ever watch where you’re going?’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going, anyway?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ As if my wetsuit didn’t make that obvious. As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he loses his temper, but he’s been making it harder for me to do lately. ‘What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. For a split second, the sharp remark hit exactly like he meant it to. But I took a deep breath and silently counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door shut behind him. Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself at the moment,’ I finished for her. I refrained from saying that he’d always been that way. But, like Mom, I try to go easy on him. When I was a child, he was my hero – from the time he first showed me photos of him in the National Geographic magazine. Those faded photos still hang framed on his bedroom wall, above his dust-covered expedition medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I’ve got my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, someday soon, maybe, my own face in National Geographic. And yet, well, a part of me still wants to remain devoted to him, this ill-tempered old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least, he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep it up, even on these cold days!’ I smiled back at her as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I come up with sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and returned to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly Grandpa's work, but different from anything he had done before and not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. A river dominated the scene; it wasn't a river she recognized and maybe not even a real one, just a fantasy. The picture was strange and shapeless, yet beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was almost invisible, just a hint of green, drawing the eye into the pale waters towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people; it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long, rich summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, too detached, showing her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the picture over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. Maybe he'll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't resist. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain to every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually to say the muse wasn't being kind to him that day, or that he had to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on. He never suggested the muse had anything to do with her. She always thought he meant some kind of goddess, not a human. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, 'Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.' It just seemed like a good idea at the time, as things often do. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm quite unlucky that way. 

What I was actually doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute! It's small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and tiny glass-panelled doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it: shepherdesses, milkmaids, and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, which is why it's shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. 

I only have two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the tiny one, like a broom cupboard, is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room, and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But since Angela is only fifteen, it seems I'll be in my broom cupboard for years. I don't really mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... 

Then it came to me. If I couldn't cut anything off Gran's cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to 'think outside the box'. And that's exactly what I was doing!"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly 'borrow' things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it would be difficult to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong opinions about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one, which made filming more complex. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres to get the Borrowers' perspective. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We developed a special technique for this. After the series aired, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh. In the story, there's a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls' clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and had to be sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, it was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was shot with actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each should look – I did 2,000 by the end. They weren’t accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work fast – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series successfully conveyed the magic of the books."
48,"Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists who aren’t there. I wonder how long it will take before the chaos starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the ""can-you-get-me-free-tickets-to-your-dad’s-concerts?"" requests. ""Everything’s going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me to face this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. To leave my old life on the road and with tour tutors. While the rest of the band is renting here during the recording, we’re staying permanently. I insisted on coming to this school because I want to meet real kids for a change. Like a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who mows lawns. That would be so normal. I walk into the school’s main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule, please,"" I tell the school secretary. ""Name?"" She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. The secretary seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad only uses his stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it’s printing,"" the secretary says. She hands me the sheet. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, so I wouldn’t look lost. When I reach the door, I hear the teacher taking roll. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" She continues while I slip in unnoticed and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes scan my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look down at my expensive platforms with tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. Dead giveaway. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says hesitantly. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and eventually gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we’ll read this year, she actually gives us time to socialize! All teachers should do this. ""So why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many options. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else choose South Beach Sounds, a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh well. Everyone will find out eventually. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. ""He’s an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way."" And she doesn’t seem to care. Excellent."
49,"Text: 'The average American teenage girl today is expected to be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. This is what it means to be an American teenager now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and stay unnoticed, because being average is not enough anymore. Mediocrity is not acceptable, and not having big ambitions is seen as laziness. ""People, often adults, forget how much pressure teenagers have these days. We have lots of homework, tests, extra-curricular activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to keep a social life,"" says teenager Kristen Loose. Despite these pressures being normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes about them still exist, often spread by the media. You know the ones: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. While there is some truth to these, putting the whole generation in this category is not fair, according to some. ""Many people think we spend most of our time watching TV and using our cell phones,"" Loose says. Loose believes this is mostly wrong. She admits to having her cellphone nearby most of the time, but not just for fun. It is not just for texting friends; it is a tool that teens use to make their lives - and the lives of those responsible for them - easier. Students today are expected to have immediate access to the world and be reachable at all times, which can look like a cell phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can now take their work with them and do homework anywhere. Instead of listening to music on the way to school, they could be listening to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate but need 24-hour attention from already busy teens. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. Their schedule is full of school, after-school activities, family duties, and homework. Then, they have to get up and do it all again the next day, with less than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation surveyed American teenagers and found that about 20 percent get the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are sleep-deprived. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all her activities, she gets about 18 hours of free time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is not much. And Olsen rarely spends those hours on social media or TV. Instead, she focuses on volunteer work. ""I think the stereotype of teenagers is that they only care about themselves and their own interests,"" Olsen says. Despite this image, Olsen says her favorite part of the week is volunteering. ""I love helping others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community during the week."" In 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but they will still be proving it wrong and pushing the world forward. There will be another generation of students who are changing the world, all before they finish school.'"
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, east of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth's surface. It's a science project with a twist: part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or metal piece enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a neighboring state, inflates the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chant, and the balloon rises. Some run and track its path with flashlights, lighting up the creamy orb in the moonless sky. There is quiet and a sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night. When the launch is over, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside and gaze at a clear sky, hard to believe it's just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of around 4 million people. I watch a boy climb into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor shoots across the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure lessens, and the balloon expands until it pops. A parachute helps the equipment land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day, using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box almost always lands in the middle of nowhere. ‘To me, recoveries are a huge part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who notes they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey has been becoming more familiar with this landscape in a way you never normally would.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side. Then they'd decide whether to drive or walk – it could be tricky if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘It's important to remember that these students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What may seem wild and dangerous to some, is simply a way of life to others.’ In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, in the middle of a waterfall. The camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars. Sure, it's a bit disappointing, but it's also a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountain ridges. And it's one more adventure story to share with others."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. Her interest began by chance. 'My younger brother was obsessed with dinosaurs, a phase common among kids, which I hadn't gone through. I usually ignored it. But when I helped him with a science project and read an article about recent discoveries, I was amazed. I knew then that I wanted to pursue this field.' I wonder what support she received, as Palaeontology wasn't a typical career choice for young people then. 'I remember meeting my first professional palaeontologist,' she laughs. 'Matt Cornelius was already famous, even though he was young. I was very nervous, despite his reputation for being friendly. I worried he'd think I was just a bothersome kid with questions. It could have been awkward,' Chloe says. 'But I felt more comfortable because he was patient and willing to listen.' I ask about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV. Chloe frowns. 'Movies like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. While I appreciate this, the few palaeontologists in films are often shown inaccurately. We're either seen as eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks, not knowing how to interact with people. Films don't show the reality of our work.' I ask her to elaborate. 'My job is very varied. I dig up dinosaur bones, but I also spend long hours in labs, analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific journals.' Although it's not a daily task, communicating scientific findings to the public is important to Chloe. 'There are many misunderstandings about science. Some colleagues avoid this challenge to focus on research, but I feel it's my duty. I like reaching out to young people to inform them about all aspects of science. Talking about dinosaurs can excite children about the natural world and broaden their understanding of science.' The TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was a chance for Chloe to influence how dinosaurs are shown on screen. She notes that the program's creators were knowledgeable, and she was there to advise if needed. 'I didn't have much to correct, like dinosaurs being too big or the wrong shape; mostly, I checked that the dinosaurs shown lived in the same time period. We attracted audiences of all ages because we've learned so much about dinosaurs recently, and those in this program are very different from those in movies like Jurassic Park. They are the most realistic ever shown.' Why does Chloe think dinosaurs continue to fascinate us and remain a research focus? 'I think they appeal to the explorer in all of us. Our imaginations are drawn to the unknown and the idea of discovery. In a world that seems smaller, prehistoric creatures remind us there's still more to discover. Palaeontology is like time travel.'"
52,"Text: 'I’m going to say this once: when you’re traveling by car with your family, even if you’re six years old, you probably know you’re not ‘there yet,’ even as you keep asking ‘Are we there yet?’ And really, once you get there, it’s not ‘there’ anymore, is it? It’s ‘here’. So if you think you might be ‘there,’ you should ask ‘Are we here yet?’ And I’m sure no one wants to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear that question over and over during long car trips. Seriously – what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather be relaxing in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs you haven’t seen before, listen to music, or do puzzles you’ve had for a while, as the scenery passes by outside the window. In the front seat, there’s mum or dad, who gives out juice boxes and cookies, or changes the radio station and temperature as needed – basically, they keep everything running smoothly like a concierge! Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying – usually my younger brother, Tim. Like putting his foot on my side of the seat. What? He can’t do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it’s his other foot, then a hand, and soon he’s in my space and we start fighting. The driver and co-pilot reach back to separate us as the car speeds up and swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a while. And the beautiful scenery continues to pass by. Soon after, I’m trying to read, and I feel something – a breeze on my arm. But the car’s not going fast and the window’s not open. Where’s it coming from? My brother is next to me, quietly blowing air onto me. He’s on his side, not touching me – so he’s technically not doing anything wrong. Just breathing? What’s the problem with that? The anger rises. Tim gets yelled at, there’s more swerving. Then slowly things calm down again – for now. Over the years, Dad has developed ways to deal with us kids in the back seat. For example, when we ask ‘Are we there yet?’ he often says, ‘Yes. We’re here. Get out of the car.’ ‘But Dad. We’re still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour.’ ‘Oh, well, then maybe we’re not there yet.’ That kept us quiet for a while. You know you’re finally ‘there’ when you see the grown-ups get out of the car and move far away from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You’re not there yet.'"
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope customers will love the experience and return. Zuzi explains their motivation: ""With so much technology, everyone is busy on their phones. We wanted to bring people together without screens. It's natural for us to communicate with each other.""

The games at their café are called 'Eurogames', known for gentle themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged. This idea was developed further in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging social interaction. Pandemic, a Eurogame by North American designer Matt Leacock, requires players to solve global problems together. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He recalls, ""When I played that with friends, we felt highs and lows. Everyone felt good, win or lose. I wanted to create something similar.""

Leacock's love for board games began in childhood. He was often disappointed by games, so with his uncle's help, he started designing better ones. Pandemic was a big success, and its sequel added storytelling elements. Leacock says, ""It's like an electronic game where you develop characters and the world changes. It's an unfolding story.""

The video game industry has helped the success of modern board games. Video games have made game-playing normal. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, says, ""Everyone with a smartphone plays games. More people are open to playing games now.""

Video games once offered social interaction in arcades or with friends at home. But as multiplayer games moved online, players became physically separated. Some people who enjoyed video games started looking for games to play with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just entertainment. In our online world, games are something to share in real life, and this trend is growing."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with setbacks. He says his mother was an amazing singer who also taught him guitar. The only radio he heard at home was a local station for middle-aged people, which influenced him as he grew up. He was 12 before he heard a contemporary song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music—he spent lunchtimes in the school music room working out songs on the piano. ""With tennis, I was at quite a high level,"" he says. ""But it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was just too much hard work."" At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. ""I went to my parents and broke down,"" he recalls. ""I told them this is what I wanted to do, that I had been writing lyrics in economics lessons and playing the piano every day when everyone else was out playing."" His dad gave him 18 months to succeed; if not, he would have to get a job. After some near misses with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo act, so he had to split with his friend. In the end, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and switched to another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not follow. ""It feels like in my own artist career, I've been in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" he says. ""But as a writer, I've been in the right place at the right time."" Writing for others is where he truly succeeded. ""I’d like to think that I am one of the main writers in the UK that UK labels look to for up-and-coming artists,"" he says. This, he believes, helps launch their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that writing with an eye on the charts is nothing to be ashamed of. ""Why? Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month? I’m not saying they should write a bad song, but we should create something amazing that will sell well too."" It is refreshing to hear someone speak so openly about wanting to write number-one hits. There is no arrogance with Scott; he realized long ago that he wants to write number ones and has the talent to do it. Instead of trying to please others, he just gets on with it. ""That’s the goal when I go into the studio with someone,"" he says. ""Whatever happens, we need to aim for a global level and write the best music of next year. It’s not just about what’s cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs."""
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity: a big star online but probably unknown to people who don’t watch online videos of bike stunts. He is a ‘street trials cyclist’—he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I interview him at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, the local boys know who he is, and even older people come to praise him, calling him ‘an absolute legend’. After seeing his skills, I agree. I was skeptical at first, but I’m impressed by his courage and creativity. Before each stunt, he explains what he plans to do, and I’m often surprised he succeeds. When I praise him, he seems indifferent and a bit down. Despite his online fame, Tony is a reluctant celebrity. He says, ‘I find the social side difficult. I see the value of connecting with fans, but I prefer doing things rather than talking about them.’ This is ironic because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. ‘This technology lets people like me make a living,’ he says. ‘Sometimes I feel everyone is focused on cameras and screens, and part of me doesn’t like that.’ But he’s not complaining. His videos allow him to earn a living from what would have been just a hobby in the past. From interviewing top athletes, I’ve learned that two important factors turn a child into an elite competitor: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. These qualities may be more important than talent and help in persisting despite failure. The riskier the sport, the more mental strength is needed. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on easy but new obstacles. He just got up and kept trying until he succeeded. Tony isn’t always seen as a hero. Some say he’s reckless and takes unnecessary risks. He responds, ‘Those who say this may be concerned but aren’t informed. They probably haven’t ridden a trials bike and don’t know the sport. They don’t understand the technical aspects and don’t realize I get expert advice to minimize risks.’ Tony is careful about the risks. ‘People are different. Some never get scared and shouldn’t do these sports; it’s wise to know the dangers. Others can’t overcome fear, and some can. I feel fear but find a way past it. I’m not addicted to risk and spend hours planning. Sometimes I ride around to get in the right mindset before a new stunt. I know I mustn’t lose my nerve before I jump. If I commit fully, I’m fine.’"
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many dangerous challenges for charity, like running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground, between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she already had some circus skills, she quickly found out that high-wire walking was very different. ""The training was a shock,"" said Helen. ""I didn’t realize how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour of them after my day practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to keep a positive attitude: if I was nervous and started shaking, so would the wire!"" On the day of the actual challenge, it was windy, and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she admitted afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" The experience has not stopped Helen, however, from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old-style bicycle with one large wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada using a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to travel to Amsterdam for a holiday. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a regular touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The highlight of his trip was reaching Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which gave him a serious fever. He was stuck in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days, with no money for hospital bills or to return home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have just started using an exciting tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark. We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are unsure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but nothing about their night activities because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new scope will give us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about how to protect their habitat. The work is very demanding. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but more often it is wet. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we will look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is necessary. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from the company I work for. Every week, I get samples from our factory to check their taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit, and spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I test and taste products I make, and I share samples with my colleagues. My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I'm at our food lab, and other times I'm traveling to buy raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety and lack of routine, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! People often ask if I get bored of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt tired of eating it. In fact, I often go home and eat more in the evening!'"
60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, ""For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s important to keep performances fresh and exciting. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is planning for the future because you can only be on the road while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options."" The course also includes business planning. Many former students start businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a profession for making money! ""The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!""'"
61,"You might not know her name or recognize her face, but you've probably heard her voice many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers. That's not true—they often need to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! ""What I love about my job is that when I walk into the recording studio, I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I'm often surprised by producers' requests. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue; I just do the job!"" ""Excellent musical abilities are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There's often no printed music to refer to. I'll never forget my first experience of recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra as well. I was terrified: I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough as they are."" ""One of my favorite jobs is doing recordings for songwriters. Less experienced writers don't always understand which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it."""
62,"Text: 'Starting with only basic fashion knowledge, Julie Deane created a successful business with her 'satchels' - a traditional bag used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in world-famous shops and are chosen by many celebrities. Before deciding on satchels, Julie made a list of different business ideas, from cake decorating to party planning, considering her options instead of going with her first idea. Once she decided, not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, 'Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced.' She involved her family from the start, working with her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural business ability, and the design came from children's storybooks. Although Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they have been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would comment in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed at which her company produces the satchels. Julie now loves waiting to see which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for original styles, keeping her products new and exciting. There was a challenging time when a company producing satchels copied Julie's design to sell similar products. As a result, she now makes sure she is as confident in the production team as she is in her own staff. Visitors comment on the positive feeling in her offices – people love working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it is the team who make it a special place.'"
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose how to spend their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she might become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it hard to balance training with schoolwork. As teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky found it exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. At 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it all – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Fortunately, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, bringing young people together as part of a larger group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people doubt whether celebrity support is always good for a charity. They think celebrities do it to promote themselves, which can hide the charity’s real work. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Singer-songwriter Ana Ronson grew up in Ireland. Her parents were not musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother to play. The first time Ana sang in front of an audience was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. This teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang happily with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest student, she knew more about music than many others. But Ana says the teacher didn’t listen to her, so she wrote Something to Say about how this made her feel. She posted the song online, and it became very popular. She was happy when people commented that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, the owner of a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from the other side of Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, she was unsure because she didn’t know the company and didn’t want anyone telling her what to sing. However, Joss convinced her this wouldn’t happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. They sold all the tickets quickly, and it was an amazing evening. Ana says she prefers writing songs about difficult times because there is more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how unhappy it made him. While she hopes fans will like her songs, her goal is to write about personal experiences that matter to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him until he finally agreed!

A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about what needed to be done. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying.

After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide mentioned that very few people lived along that coast. Indeed, the only other living creatures we saw on the first morning were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches along the coast. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, though, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it really felt like stress-free living!

When the time came to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. As a child, I often went to watch his games. You might think that seeing so many games would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I enjoyed telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually brought a book to read instead of watching the game. When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. Even though I liked the training session, I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I did. It took some time for me to agree, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. Having my mum and dad watch made me nervous, but it turned out fine! For the next four years, I practiced every day and did well, even joining an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA at fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn't enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I couldn't spend much time with friends because of all the training, so that part didn't change much. Eventually, I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too! I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most professional players since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to fix that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college and needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I trained to be a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be simple, but I found out that to get a licence, I needed to know much more than I had learned. All Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group. You need other skills too. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. Most importantly, you need to handle unexpected situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organised tour, not hear about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know that good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy usually lead to very good reviews, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella, and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister, Josie. She is five years younger than me, but we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we had nothing to worry about.

One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to gather food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so collecting this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meal made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. By moonlight, we led the elephants on foot into the forest area where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. We chose this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn’t include meat, which we both prefer to avoid. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games.

Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t often talk about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit annoyed with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day—I certainly will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa, and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different customers, not just people buying them for friends or their homes. Hotels and offices often want flowers for their reception areas, and sometimes we provide flowers for business photo shoots. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it.

My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I’m crazy, but I love what I do. It’s often colder and darker than I’d like, but that’s normal at that time, so I don’t mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I’d probably only get pink ones because it’s my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what customers want can be different. Not all flowers are available all year, so sometimes I can’t find what customers want.

I don’t really like arguing about prices with the flower-sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers aren’t cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and arrange the flowers I bought. Then we make flower arrangements and calculate the cost of orders. Customers are often surprised by the prices, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider their choices. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy finding the best flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things – I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It's close to where I live, but a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to discuss a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, and it was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which helps us keep our prices low. We’re happy to just cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still a lot to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. The website has been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs across the country. We’ve visited to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing is as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed."
71,"Taking photographs was always my favorite thing to do as a child. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby further, so I decided to do something special. I started a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I began. After a few weeks, I decided to upload these photos to a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was surprised to find that some people liked how I saw and photographed things. I also enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be better. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing—they were taking color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost gave up, but I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style and choices. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough for me to work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio, and I’ve never regretted my career choice."
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was quite shy then, and all the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. I decided to take up the challenge, but only because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me continue volunteering at the club because I had built strong relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to going. 

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before starting at the club, and the idea of youth work had never crossed my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I’ve earned several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was so young that I hadn't thought about asking to snowboard, but my dad was already into it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After this, I quickly developed a love for the sport and improved my skills. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored of snowboarding, but my love for competing and winning has grown stronger as I’ve gotten older. This helps me push myself harder. I enjoy not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That achievement increased my confidence in my abilities. During the summer, I focus on training and my studies because there’s no snow. Although I train daily, it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends then. It’s the best way to cope with not being able to do what I love and am good at. I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I also think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering whether becoming a doctor is possible if my active life allows time for a college degree. It’s hard to imagine getting tired of the sport, but I can’t snowboard my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a valuable lesson from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces and asked if I could try. I found it easier than I expected, even though it looked complicated when Mum did it. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make something nice at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery pieces to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. To see if others would like them, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists visit where I live, and they bought my jewellery as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just my mum and me at a market stall! That’s when I knew it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I’ve made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It’s been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly inspired by Janine’s own life. In an interview about her book, Janine said, ""Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, adjusts to a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m an only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that."" Janine started her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always dreamed of becoming a published author, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to spend her time writing. The year before, she had entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people there were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was available in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia mentions that, even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the characters in the story actually face some difficult challenges, which makes them believable to readers. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a particularly long novel, she has shown that she is a better writer than several other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! It all began when my father was asked to be the castle's manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was happy because he thought he might not get such a great opportunity again, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were mainly thinking about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very lively in summer because it attracts many visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island, which often involves a lot of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day back to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days when there are huge waves – but the ferries don't run then! And I've found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I'm always telling them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, though, it's so foggy that you can't see anything, then within hours, it's brilliant sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it's been here for centuries – and it's still standing!"
77,"I live in a house surrounded by beautiful countryside in Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and how to find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m almost there. On family holidays abroad, I’ve had the chance to see birds from other countries, too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I thought I’d see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, though, as I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it and commented that it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching to the school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they’d really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after some time, I became a decent player. However, my family knew I often got excited about new hobbies and then lost interest, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. In fact, I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. And the chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a talented player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know that young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club when I was just 13 years old. After that, I improved a lot. Despite this, people still doubted I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. As usual, despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach’s voice cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. Fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football and to give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will let them see the professional environment and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team if they’re willing to work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"One of the most interesting changes in higher education in the UK and around the world in recent years is the push to get new students involved in research early in their studies. This shift acknowledges that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making big discoveries, but is a natural and essential way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your job, as they help you think about the world and approach your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You don't just learn and repeat it; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions instead of accepting things as they are. You might ask: Why? How? When? What does this mean? How could this be done differently? How does it work in another context? What do we really think about the facts, views, or beliefs we are given? Why does it matter? These are common questions that form the basis of research. 

Research can be seen as a range of activities. At one end, there is the 'blue skies' research, which is groundbreaking and complex, done by highly trained people and leading to big changes. At the other end, research can be everyday inquiries with a solid design, involving careful work and thoughtful questions about issues, practices, and events. Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have done research for projects and answered questions at school or work since you started. You have been asking questions that led to investigations since you first became interested in studying. You have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, choosing a music system, or shopping online. 

In college and higher education, having a curious mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas, and creating your own responses and knowledge are expected learning activities. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and authorities, and you might feel you need to be told what is important to learn. However, in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem daunting. Critical thinking is especially important in research. The research of others is useful to students, academics, and in the workplace, but we need to do more than just repeat what we read. We must engage with it, think about it, test it, and decide if what we are told is logical, reasoned, and supported by evidence. We should not rely uncritically on facts and information given to us by others."
80,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London gathered in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. Those same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities are creative hubs, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. Although we know city life is tiring, new research shows it can also make us think less clearly. One major reason is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for our brains. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they offer a break from city stress. This research is timely, as more people now live in cities than ever before. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded urban areas with millions of strangers. These unnatural environments affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy city street, our brains must track many things: distracted people, traffic, and the complex city layout. This constant attention drains our mental energy. Cities are full of stimuli, forcing us to focus and refocus, which is tiring. In contrast, natural settings don't require as much mental effort. This idea, called attention restoration theory, was developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Nature captures our attention without causing stress, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge. Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about city life and tried to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York offer an escape from urban life and can quickly improve brain function. While people try many things to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or office redesigns, simply walking in nature seems more effective. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Why? Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that tire our brains, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities drives creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a hub of new ideas, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of technological innovation. Less crowded cities might produce less innovation over time. The challenge is to reduce the mental strain of city life while keeping its benefits. After all, as the saying goes, sometimes people just want to leave the trees and return to the city."
81,"Text: 'Where should we look for the mind? It might seem obvious: thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain scans to show this. But I believe the study of the mind shouldn't stop at the skin or skull. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as neurons, are part of human thinking. From an archaeological view, stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have played a role in human evolution and shaping the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might still be part of the mind. It's easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people away from the objects they usually have around them. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limits of brain-scanning machines. But this often hides the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I don't question the brain's role in thinking, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It might be useful to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the skin into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how these ways have changed since ancient times and what these changes mean for how we think. This approach gives new insights into what minds are by changing what we know about how objects help the mind. Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person's self begin? The unity of the blind person and the stick helps us see minds and objects as connected. It also shows the flexibility of the human mind: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick plays an active role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. The blind person's stick reminds us that human intelligence can change deeply by adding new technologies. My approach sees the human mind as always evolving. It's important to remember that, whatever form the 'stick' has taken in our history—from early stone tools to the internet—its main role was as a pathway, not a boundary. Through the 'stick', humans explore and understand the world and move forward. That's why a stick used by a monkey to get food is different. For humans, 'sticks' satisfy our curiosity. This unique human tendency to engage with objects explains why we make things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds change as they interact with the material world. I want to include materiality in understanding the mind. MET offers a new way to see how different objects, from stone axes to smartphones, have defined and transformed us and our thinking. Mind-changing technology sounds futuristic, but humans have used it since we first evolved.'"
82,"Photography is one of the few inventions that have significantly changed civilization and our understanding of the world. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became a part of American culture at all levels—from practical and scientific uses to industrial and artistic ones, as well as entertainment. Historians argue that photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. No other art form has seen such a significant impact from US work. This is a bold statement, but it shows how photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discussions. To fully appreciate its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century. 

Why was photography so appealing? First, because it was a mechanical process, it matched the growing enthusiasm for technology in a country that embraced change. Just as steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with stunning immediacy. Second, the camera was the preferred tool for representing oneself, allowing people to present an image for public view in a country where personal and national identities were always being created and recreated. Third, the camera was important for creating and maintaining a family record, even if it was somewhat idealized. Finally, the realism of photographs matched the American artists' tendency towards realism and depicting everyday life. 

Every photograph draws attention to something, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Because a photograph is made by a machine, it has a unique quality: it records events, people, and things, capturing what was in front of the camera with a certain objectivity. However, since it is taken by an individual, it also carries a personal perspective, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, leading to the idea of photography as a 'universal language.' But the meaning of photographs is more complex. Few things inherently convey their own meaning, and no image is presented without some context that affects our understanding—like a newspaper caption, a magazine layout, or its placement in a gallery or book. To understand a photograph historically, we must consider its purpose and role in its cultural context: Why did the photographer take it? How was it first seen? The same image might appear in different places and times, changing its meaning each time.

The camera's importance to artists was once a secret, but now it is widely recognized. For several decades, starting with US artist Andy Warhol's use of photographs in paintings, silk screens, and multiples, artists have been incorporating photographs into their work in various ways. In short, photographic vision has become an essential part of art history, not opposing painting but complementing it, and is crucial to our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some understanding of what this means. However, even though we can study this concept in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains somewhat difficult to fully grasp. James, like most psychologists, was especially interested in human psychology. He believed it involved basic elements: thoughts and feelings, a physical world existing in time and space, and a way of knowing about these things. This knowledge is mainly personal and private, coming from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It may or may not be influenced by scientific facts. Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological matters based on our own experiences. We act as amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex psychological issues, like whether brainwashing works, or when we state our opinions as facts about why people behave in certain ways, such as feeling insulted or unhappy, or suddenly quitting their jobs. Problems arise when two people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to provide methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in a given situation or to determine when each explanation applies. Psychologists help us distinguish between thoughts that are subjective and possibly biased, and facts that are scientifically true. Psychology, as defined by William James, is about the mind or brain. Although psychologists study the brain, they do not fully understand how it influences our hopes, fears, and wishes, or our behavior in different situations, like giving birth or watching a football match. It is often not possible to study the brain directly. Therefore, psychologists learn more by studying behavior and using observations to form hypotheses about what is happening inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not directly observable like an engine's. In everyday life, they can only be seen indirectly and must be inferred from behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, involving evaluating and interpreting clues. These clues must come from careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical analysis that can be publicly examined. Complex interactions are common in psychology, and understanding them requires advanced techniques and theories. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or change the processes it studies. Once these goals are achieved, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply conclusions to people's lives. Psychological findings have been useful in areas like teaching children to read, designing safer machine control panels, and helping emotionally distressed people communicate their feelings better. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been scientifically studied in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or reflecting on one's own conscious experience, to answer psychological questions. These early studies aimed to identify mental structures, which is still important today. However, introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of automatic brain work. William James compared trying to understand the mind through introspection to ""turning up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks."" Modern psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than on personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a typical business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place known as the Museum of Failed Products. This museum, owned by a company called GfK, displays products that were removed from sale because very few people wanted to buy them. You can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola there. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, believes each product tells a sad story about the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. Surprisingly, the museum is a successful business. You might think that companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but many executives visit the museum because they haven't done so. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, began collecting new products in the 1960s to create a 'reference library.' He didn't plan to focus on failures, but he discovered that 'most products fail.' By collecting all new products, he ended up with mostly unsuccessful ones.

Today's culture of optimism might explain why these products exist. Each product likely passed through meetings where no one realized it was doomed. Even if they did, marketers might have continued investing in a failing product to force some sales and save face. Little effort is made to understand what went wrong, and people involved often avoid discussing it. This focus on optimism is common in the growing 'self-help' industry, where 'positive visualization' is popular. The idea is that imagining success makes it more likely to happen. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot suggests that our brains might be wired to see things more positively than they are. Her research shows that well-balanced people often have an overly optimistic view of their ability to influence events, unlike those with depression.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen has studied whether 'positive fantasies about the future' are effective. Her findings are surprising: thinking too much about success can actually reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people encouraged to imagine a successful week at work often achieved less. Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a 'fixed theory' mindset think ability is innate, while those with an 'incremental theory' believe it develops through effort. Fixed-theory individuals see failure as proof they lack ability, like a sports star who relies on being a 'natural' and doesn't practice enough. Incremental-theory people view failure as a sign they are pushing their limits. Dweck compares this to weight-training: muscles grow by being pushed to their limits, tearing and healing stronger. Having an incremental mindset is a happier way to live, regardless of success."
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have a big advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many of us think we know; it seems obvious. However, professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main factors challenge the traditional idea of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what makes players perform at their best, and they have many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, financial experts wonder why home advantage should matter if players are paid well. Shouldn't players feel comfortable anywhere if they earn enough? 

What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their passion and loyalty. Fans often think that their cheering leads to goals, but they forget the times when their noise didn't lead to success. 

However, one fan belief is supported by science. Home fans often try to influence the referee. In a famous experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This matched the actual decisions made during the game. Researchers concluded that referees avoid extra stress by not making calls against the home team. They don't do what the crowd wants; they just try to avoid the crowd's anger.

Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England's Football League won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in luxury. Stadiums are also more similar now. Despite these changes, home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. 

One reason might be that home advantage is more about team spirit. In baseball, it's more about individual battles between batter and pitcher. Team sports like basketball rely on teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home. 

Another possibility is related to a primitive urge to defend home territory. Researchers found that players' testosterone levels were higher before home matches. This was seen in the Rugby World Cup, where underdog teams at home won against stronger opponents. As one referee said, 'It’s the law of the jungle out there.'"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about fifty years ago. This saying is famous in sports and valued by athletes and coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with claims for other golfers of that time. Its meaning is also puzzling. Player didn't mean luck literally; he was speaking ironically. His real message was: ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ But how much practice is enough? This question is central to the nature-nurture debate in sports: is talent born or made? The debate is not balanced; nurture, or practice, is often seen as more important than natural talent. This idea is supported by psychologist Anders Ericsson, who proposed that 10,000 hours of practice can make anyone an expert. His theory inspired books like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers"" and others that argue practice is key. They suggest that 10,000 hours is necessary and enough to become an expert. However, in his book, Epstein argues that this is not always true. He points out a flaw in studies of excellence: they focus on successful people and try to explain their success. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others don’t, looking at both innate traits and environmental factors. His research takes him worldwide, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to the Arctic. In Alaska, he learns that in sled dog races, the dogs' drive and desire might be influenced by genetics, suggesting that determination might also have a genetic component. This shows the complexity of the topic. Epstein distinguishes between 'hardware' (nature) and 'software' (nurture) and agrees that both are needed for elite athletes. He does not dismiss the importance of training or environment, suggesting that if Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. But Epstein also examines cases where genetics are crucial. He also looks at race and gender issues. For example, he asks: ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?’ Sometimes the best questions are the simplest."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks why this is happening. In her book, ""Kith,"" she suggests that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, in front of screens, and have lost touch with nature. Griffiths believes this is the main issue. This idea is supported by other discussions about modern childhood. A follow-up study interviewed children and found that many would be happier if they could spend more time outside. People over 40 often remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling how they spent time exploring outdoors, which they believe was healthier than the protected lives of today's children. However, they don't often realize that they are the ones who have created this protective environment for their children, avoiding risks like playing in old sheds.

Griffiths' book includes strong arguments. She discusses how fear of outdoor dangers and child-focused consumerism are connected. Parents' fears keep children indoors, benefiting the toy and gadget industry. She also criticizes trends like prescribing medication for restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. While it's unclear how common these practices are, Griffiths expresses her frustration effectively. She also talks about childhood freedoms and restrictions, from fairy tales to school rules. Although her arguments are appealing, Griffiths sometimes takes them too far, ignoring important counter-arguments. At one point, she even compares modern treatment of children to a form of racism, which seems exaggerated.

Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children. She has an idealized view of them, which might not hold up in real life. For example, she describes children as ""musicians of thought,"" which might not match the reality of most parents' experiences. The book's main theme is that children should have the freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths argues that children need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children may want the adventurous life Griffiths describes. What about the quiet, cautious children? Perhaps the real issue is forcing all children into the same mold, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I'm a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I've spent a lot of time in school. I'm good at solving problems in my work and life, but this isn't because of my schooling. Most life problems can't be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the value of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when young, and those with more to learn play the most. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when allowed. Play is how adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, moral lives can't be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced in play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is key to economic success. We don't need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate obstacles, we'll have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his innovative work 'combinatorial play.' He developed his concept of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We can't teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling focused on imposed questions with one right answer. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and this play helps them learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit. If you can't quit, it's not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue the game. The power to quit makes play democratic. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and pressure for high grades has grown. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now intervene instead of letting children solve problems. These changes have been gradual but significant, caused by social factors like parents' fears, expert warnings, declining neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than each other. Our children don't need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to play and explore to grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow direct contact with potential employers, attracting their attention in ways that used to require more dramatic efforts, like standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with this access comes the risk of mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US reached out to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had a valuable list of contacts that the jobseeker hoped could help him find a job. But the executive was not pleased. She was upset at the idea of sharing her carefully built contact list with a stranger who hadn't earned it. She not only rejected his request but also sent a harsh and sarcastic note, which went viral online. Many who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might now regret her tone, if not her message. However, this incident might help young people think more carefully about using social media professionally. It highlights a truth: social media can be risky for job seekers who don't use it wisely, and many are making mistakes. 

This is ironic because, in many countries, sites like Facebook and Twitter have been central to the social lives of twentysomethings for years. For my generation, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was like an online playground where we could impress others and experiment with our identities. We could have long conversations online and then ignore the same people at school. By choosing the right pictures or songs for our Facebook pages, we could become more interesting overnight. And if we didn't want to talk, we could just ""poke"" people on Facebook. 

However, using social media for professional networking is very different. Our experience with sites like Facebook might actually be a disadvantage. Some twentysomethings don't see the difference. We first gained our online presence by being bold and confident, which might explain why some of us still think this is a good approach. Just because many people ""liked"" your Facebook posts doesn't mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you're worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers doesn't apply now, and we must meet employers' standards to succeed in the job market. 

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too informal and seem arrogant. This reinforces the stereotype of us as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, we are far from entitled; in many countries, we are increasingly desperate to find jobs, which is why we turn to social media. This impression of arrogance harms the job prospects of young people who, despite their communication mistakes, have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees. 

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them—perhaps you could do some research or help in another way. This approach increases your chances of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, generic messages, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it requires careful handling to avoid negative outcomes."
90,"Text: 'Anyone who claims they can predict the future of newspapers with certainty is either lying or mistaken. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. In the USA, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main news source for only 26% of people, compared to 45% in 2001. Many predict that printed newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist claimed that books and theatre were outdated, but theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio thrived alongside TV, and cinema has competed with videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have returned, with online sales up 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main news source. This was partly because producing news for a large audience became possible only in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. Also important was the idea that everything is constantly changing and we need regular updates, a concept unfamiliar in medieval times. Now, we expect change. To medieval people, life was cyclical, marked by seasons and unpredictable disasters like famine or disease. Journalism as a profession barely existed before the 19th century, and there was little reason for regular news updates. Regular newspaper publication can be limiting. Online news allows readers to check updates as they see fit. Search engines and algorithms let us customize news to our interests. Internet news can provide minute-by-minute updates, and errors can be corrected quickly. There are no space limits, and full documents can be accessed. This is very different from traditional newspapers. However, online news often focuses on being first and creating excitement, rather than spreading understanding. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we are returning to that. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction, or they might find a way to guide us to wisdom and understanding in a chaotic world.'"
91,"If humans were truly comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, seeing the midnight world as clearly as the many nocturnal species that thrive in it. However, we are creatures of the day, with eyes suited for sunlight. This fact is deeply rooted in our genetics, even if we don't often think of ourselves as daytime beings, just as we don't constantly think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This explains why we have changed the night by filling it with light. We have engineered the night to suit us, similar to how we control rivers with dams. This control has benefits but also leads to problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just beginning to study. Light pollution mainly comes from poor lighting design, where artificial light shines outward and upward into the sky instead of focusing downward. This poorly designed lighting brightens the night, changing the natural light levels and rhythms that many life forms, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would have been meaningless. Imagine approaching London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's most populous city. Nearly a million people lived there, relying on candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few homes had gas lighting, and public gaslights wouldn't appear for another seven years. From a few miles away, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We have illuminated the night as if it were empty, but this is far from true. Among mammals alone, the number of nocturnal species is remarkable. Light is a strong biological force, attracting many species. The effect is so strong that scientists describe songbirds and seabirds as being 'captured' by searchlights on land or by the light from gas flares on marine oil platforms, circling until they fall. Birds migrating at night often collide with brightly lit tall buildings; young birds on their first journey are especially vulnerable. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at odd hours when exposed to artificial light. It was once believed that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky for their work. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need an unobstructed view of the night sky for our jobs, but like most creatures, we do need darkness. Ignoring the need for darkness is pointless. It is as crucial for our biological health as light itself; disrupting our internal clock can lead to various health issues. The regular cycle of waking and sleeping in our lives mirrors the regular cycle of light on Earth. These rhythms are so fundamental to us that disturbing them is like changing our center of gravity. Ultimately, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs in a pond near a brightly lit highway. Living in the glare we have created, we have disconnected from our evolutionary and cultural heritage—the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. In a real sense, light pollution makes us lose sight of our true place in the universe, causing us to forget our scale, which is best understood against the backdrop of a deep night with the Milky Way arching overhead."
92,"The founder of a large international company recently announced that his company will stop tracking employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by an internet company with a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by his media team. Ignoring the way the announcement was made, we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services, like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want if it doesn't harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's workloads. The founder of the multinational said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team are up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? No matter how much you prepare, work piles up when you're on holiday. This is just how leave works; you pause your work, but it keeps accumulating. Someone following these rules might not take leave at all or feel guilty about it. Guilt can lead to stress, and not taking enough leave can reduce productivity over time. There might also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is off and for how long. This pressure already affects when people start and end their workday. In the corporate world, there's a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotions. If the security of statutory leave is removed, people might feel they can't take the leave they need, fearing they look lazy. They wouldn't have their legal right to rely on. The policy might make workers feel unable to take leave, or they might stick to their legal rights, making the policy pointless. Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, blurring the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees asked how this new work style fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours accurately, why use an outdated standard for time off? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being watched, making them self-discipline, which could be harmful. Employment law exists for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like better morale, creativity, and productivity, can exist without affecting worker well-being. I doubt that ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in a field evaluate a scientific research paper before it is published. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research by preventing flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often reassure the public about its importance. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trust in published research? The answer is both yes and no. Examining these issues reveals much about the current state of scientific publishing, which is changing. 

I am not ready to give up on journal-based peer review. I still believe papers should be checked before formal publication, but I notice changes happening. The increasing use of preprints—drafts of papers posted online without peer review—is a key part of this change. Preprints allow for the quick sharing of new results so they can be read, critiqued, and built upon. Publishing in journals has become more about gaining recognition and advancing careers, which has affected both authors' motivations and reviewers' roles. Competition for spots in top journals pushes scientists to do their best work, but it also encourages cutting corners, as stories without inconvenient data are more likely to be published. Reviewers now often decide if a manuscript is suitable for a journal based on its newsworthiness rather than its scientific quality. 

These issues are well known, but few are willing to change the current system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints might offer a solution because they don't require a major change from the norm. Although preprint archives have existed for twenty years, they are not widely used. This slow adoption is due to scientists' conservative nature and the misconception that journals won't accept papers posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review will lead to 'junk science,' but this has not happened yet. 

Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but authors know they will be critiqued by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience: 'My paper critiqued a published paper, which is difficult in traditional journals. With anonymous peer review, the original authors might block a critical paper, or they might not be chosen and could complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their feedback. All comments are public, so readers can judge the arguments' quality. Rejection by journals is less of a concern because the preprint and comments are still available, so our work isn't wasted.'

Preprint archives allow for global scientific discussions that were once private. They could also be a place for negative results, an important part of science often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Being on preprint archives increases how often papers are read and cited, showing the effectiveness of sharing through preprints. By using the web's openness and the collaborative spirit in the scientific community, preprints can help focus on the work itself, not where it is published."
94,"When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ‘a painting in words’. These answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to pick an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist would, and another from the object's point of view, titled ‘Poem.’ Here’s what one student wrote:

Poem  
I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and even then only for a short time. Most people will never need me.  

The object? An oxygen mask – an unusual choice that helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to fun and useful discussions. When I was in school, poetry often seemed confusing to me. I thought of every poem as a puzzle that blocked true understanding and feeling. After school, poetry becomes something most people engage with less and less. Sometimes you come across a poem, and it stands out because it’s not continuous prose. It almost challenges you to read it, and often you feel let down by its simplicity or because it’s hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we hope to find in poems? Aren’t they supposed to hold deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels offer us worlds to escape to, paintings give us visual pleasure, and music – well, nothing quite matches the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. However, one thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life – unlike reading sentence by sentence – is full of it. But these thoughts still don’t explain what a poem really is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it redirects to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of literary art using aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language like sound symbolism, etc.’ This is fine academic language, but it hides the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable, unpredictable – or to machines – human-made and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t hold up on closer look. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It can help the mind explore new ways of thinking and make us see ordinary things differently. The poem as a mental object is not hard to grasp, especially if we think about how song lyrics can stick in our heads. The mix of words and melody has a strong effect, going back to childhood rhymes like ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, looking right at you: A poem can hit home like nothing else, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is created through writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing made to be sold. Publishing houses write press releases and send out review copies of poetry collections, but few expect a collection to cover its printing costs. A poem presents itself not as something for the market, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem still has the power to surprise, even if only for a moment."
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been wiser to spend it on something for the house. However, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has made me happy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

It was a dull February afternoon, and I had some free time and a place in mind to search. But since it was raining, I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming machinery. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a rounded, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, intricately patterned loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, which is in the British Museum. It's a famous piece from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a beautiful necklace made of gold and silver, with gold rings at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. ‘Marion!’ I called, ‘I've got something for you.’ She came in, stopped, and asked, ‘What is it?’ I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been burgled, but I was anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says you must report such finds to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask me, ‘Now that you've found something so amazing, are you going to stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing—not when there's a chance of catching an even bigger fish tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite parts of traveling, but I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When friends describe their carefully planned trips, filled with activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rainstorms and lazy mornings in Italian sheets? Better sleep is a happy side effect of travel. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, surrounded by new smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and dream more than I thought possible. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I don't think just relaxing explains why travel sleep feels so different. I believe sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, smells, and ways of living. We take in new cultures, music, landscapes, and even ways of moving. During sleep, we process all this new information. No wonder sleep feels more intense when traveling. Sleep also changes with each place. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs affects me more than time zones. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to adjust to their sleep patterns. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends overlooking the Caribbean Sea. After eating, the conversation slowed and stopped. My friends left the table to rest on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows on the floor. I joined them, experiencing the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is also memorable. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds that fill my dreams. If 'slow travel'—enjoying each experience fully rather than rushing—is what defines the modern traveler, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said to her customer with practiced diplomacy. The woman wrinkled her nose and scrunched up her face, looking a bit like a bulldog. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said decisively, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would indeed stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and Mia was looking forward to seeing Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing. They knew nothing about this friend, as her husband Jeff had pointed out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff had said when Mia told him, ""What sort of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" ""More like something very affected,"" Jeff retorted. Her husband disliked affectation or anything showy. He also didn't believe in ""pussyfooting about,"" as he called Mia’s reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn’t have held back with the woman in the shop: he would have told her she was choosing the wrong hat. He might even have said a dustbin lid would suit her better. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and entered the back door of Medlar House: her commute from work took only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia had the idea to convert the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was skeptical. ""Do you really think there's demand for hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends who struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions that the demand was there. She was right. From day one, after Jen helped her create a website to promote the business, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from miles around to her showroom in Little Pelham, where in a relaxed and welcoming environment, they could try on as many hats as they needed to find the right one. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits so nothing was left to chance. She had recently expanded her services to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"Text: 'Lawrence Okoye has traveled a long way from London to Atlanta, reflecting on his incredible sports journey. He is confident but surprised by how far he has come—from competing in an Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Despite never playing American football before, Lawrence is likely to be picked for a top USA team. In Atlanta, he is learning the responsibilities of his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be selected for a major American sports team is surprising. But Lawrence is used to overcoming doubts. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but delayed it to focus on discus, after playing rugby. Within 20 months, he became the world’s fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, aiming for the world championships. He confirms that he decided to try American football only after arriving in the USA. At school in London, he had thought about it, but it seemed unrealistic then. Soon after arriving in America, he learned about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ‘Pretty much,’ Lawrence says. He applied online. Was he nervous about competing with experienced players? ‘No,’ he says. ‘I don’t get nervous for many things.’ He is not very talkative, but he believes in his abilities. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ‘I was very pleased to hear that,’ he says, showing a rare sign of pride. However, he is cautious. Lawrence has no basic experience in American football. How can he make it into an NFL team? ‘Coaches say I have the necessary attributes. It’s about how hard I work,’ he replies. Is he relaxed while waiting to hear if he’s selected? ‘I am. There’s no pressure on me. Many people say I’ll be selected, but I’m not too worried.’ This calmness might come from his Olympic experience, where he finished last in the discus final. He seems to have moved past this and is proud of qualifying for the final with an impressive last throw. ‘That was an amazing day,’ he says. ‘The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s part of sport. I can return to it.’ After the Olympics, some thought the experience affected him negatively. Lawrence doesn’t comment on this. An NFL player’s minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so the financial benefits are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his talents, wouldn’t it be better to focus on one sport? ‘I understand why someone would say that,’ he responds. ‘I’m trying to achieve something I dreamed of as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work out, I can return to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought through.’'"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out of the window at the empty landscape below, the dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, winter had not yet started in Siberia. I saw no sign of human life, and the view stretched out in a mix of mountains, streams, and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said, pronouncing my name with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow flying to the far reaches of civilization to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with the help of a dictionary, I had explained to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he reasoned with me, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it these days. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and with just one word, ""Holodna"" (cold), he pointed outside. I tried to reassure him by explaining with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I left out the fact that, because my trip was self-funded, I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment had been bought at reduced prices. In reality, I was not sure they would be up to the job. This was especially true of my large postman’s over-trousers, which I had bought for £10. It had all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall that morning was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes, without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me slouched Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy handwriting, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job did tick many important boxes for me. It was frequently challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were great long holidays in which to chase adventures. Twice since I had started teaching, I had used these holidays to go meet Al. He had caught the adventuring bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and had decided to do something far more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. Ever since that first ride we had taken together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times he thought that the ride, or the road, would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could deal with each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the skeptics who had told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns racing through pylons that are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it's like to participate. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed I was in good health, and the second required me to empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned I needed to stay oriented. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" I was told, and the pilot would explain where to look. I was also asked to promise to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing and was told not to touch anything. As we taxied down the runway, my legs were up, trying not to touch the steering pedals, and my hands were avoiding the switches. My mind was made up: I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To avoid passing out, you must stay calm and focused, tensing and relaxing at the right times. Panicking is not a good idea. None of this was comforting as we accelerated down the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we sharply turned right. It was a sudden, intense move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned sharply left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, heading for the small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was interrupted by a sharp right turn. We hadn't even done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, my hand shaking so much that the plane shook too—it’s that responsive. Then Dario said something. I asked him to repeat it, but instead, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" ""Yup."" ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane up and over, making a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw some fields. The flight lasted 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots experience during a race. To show this, Dario ate sandwiches as soon as we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night, I dreamed of doing loops over and over again."
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you’ve ever been amazed by footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it’s probably been filmed by him. His ideal temperature, he says, is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about surviving in cold places. His big break came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman ticked all the boxes: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I came along at a good time. When I started, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing sequences were just waiting to be captured on film.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy assignment. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is vicious and hauling cameras in the deep snow is a nightmare. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting supplies on the way. This meant swimming through extremely cold waters and facing frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, preparing for an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers are confident and driven people, and they need to be. This time, however, there is much more at stake. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important to scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. This is a job he was prepared for. As a child, Pen was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tougher by sending him out into blizzards and icy winds with as few clothes as possible. His father passed on a love of frozen adventures, and Pen showed unusual physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and shares his love of the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he’s at home: ‘He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic.’ For fun, she once competed against him in a famous mountain event where riders on horseback race against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour ahead of Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he admits. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I thought it would be a good idea to say to my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He took it very seriously, asking his mum how she was all the time, but it eventually became too much. While it was well-intentioned, it was unfair.’ For similar reasons, he plans to have very little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending these last days before leaving preparing his equipment, obsessively. ‘Out on the ice, you can hardly fix things or do anything that isn’t very simple,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, one of the world’s top polar explorers, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will be supported by a team of six, flying in supplies. Being part of a team is actually more stressful for someone like him, says Pen, and something else is on his mind too. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done far less training than I’m comfortable with.’ Why? ‘Organisational things always seem more urgent. So I’m almost fearful of what I’m going to ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that inspired past generations to explore the unknown. ‘Reaching the North Pole was ultimately a personal goal,’ he admits, ‘and of limited value to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re creating a platform to engage as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and nobody can do it but us,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which are otherwise unusual and not needed in society, have become very relevant. Suddenly, we’re useful again.’"
103,"Text: I had a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Although these activities were great, there wasn't anything competitive to focus on. I knew I wanted to stay in shape, so I could fight for an Olympic place if I wanted to. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I have always loved rowing; the way the boat moves through the water. I missed that feeling, but I wasn't ready to train seven days a week. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked some rowing friends if they were interested in the race; no one was enthusiastic. I knew if I entered, even though it was mainly an adventure, I would want to win. Would doing it with Ben give me the best chance of winning? No. But part of me liked the idea of being an underdog with no pressure. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had managed to gather the entry fee and deposit for a boat, making the race a real possibility. We talked about the remaining costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a huge amount. We thought we had a better chance than most, but it would still take work to secure it. Besides the race costs, I also had to consider the loss of earnings from being away. Speaking at business conferences is one of the best ways to earn money as a retired athlete. It's nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Participating in the race would mean I wouldn't just be talking about past achievements. I'd be doing something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My Olympic preparation was tough, my life focused on getting in the best shape; but looking back, it was straightforward. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the program was set, with doctors and dieticians. I was worried about people's reactions to me racing with a TV presenter. I was concerned it would look like I just wanted to be on TV, otherwise, I would have chosen a better partner to win the race. My concerns disappeared during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had completed the tough Marathon des Sables, spent a lot of time at sea, and a year on a deserted island. But he couldn't row. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of sympathy. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest with Ben about the improvements he needed. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle, in the far north of Finland. At 26, I felt restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty spaces, maybe as a reaction to the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, deep in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow, for trips lasting from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second property – the 'wilderness farm’, which they said was a beautiful but basic place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I stare at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies; I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out of the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of opening flowers and leaves. But I think I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forest – thin conifers, heavy with snow – stopping sometimes to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely through the door when I’m given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the sound of barking, which becomes a wall of noise by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth along the lines of huskies, pulling them out and harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost hysterical with excitement, pulling hard against the ropes in their eagerness to go. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to stop and talk much anyway. I stand on the side and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command rings out, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light. November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a discouraging questioning about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m stumped. I don’t know. Am I? Further questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in sub-zero conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around myself by overenthusiastic huskies. But I am triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe sprinted past the finish line, the press gathered to understand her extraordinary run. Her time was so impressive that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after a freak accident when she ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe says the achievement never really sank in. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal at the time. However, she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day, and it flowed over her. She and her support team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio coverage. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could maintain such a fast pace, fearing she might drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, though he admitted that anyone unaware of her fitness might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe calculated she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers at high speed but still sprinted the remaining distance in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run quicker than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he never thought anyone would come near that time soon. Radcliffe thought, “I'm going to come back and do it next year.” Unfortunately, that didn't happen. After the race, people wondered how an athlete with such an awkward style beat the grace and skill of the East African runners. Hartmann had stayed with Radcliffe for weeks, providing daily sessions to counter the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. I had to go so deep into her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's French training base, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no greeting or offer of tea. ‘I'd barely got in the door, and she was waiting for a two-hour session. Paula would extract that last ounce out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that time, Hartmann gave so much attention to Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has come close to her record? ‘Not really. I trained really hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought it might happen with Mary Keitany (two-time London marathon winner). Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never letting off the gas, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me to it because I never thought, “I can relax now.” It was always: “keep pushing as hard as you can.”’ Radcliffe didn't know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run as fast again. However, she left a lasting legacy, inspiring many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"When my first cookery programme, ""In Search of Perfection,"" was released, I was unsure how viewers and the press would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' happening in Britain. I believed our series made an innovative contribution to this, but I was still concerned: would people appreciate a cooking approach that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode with mixed feelings of joy and fear. I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other exciting projects, including a book based on my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called ""Perfection,"" each with its own TV programme. In these, the journey was often very physical, involving travel with passports and suitcases. ""In Search of Total Perfection"" is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet extraordinary artisans, like a man dedicated to creating the best-tasting golden pasta. These people have spent years pursuing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is subjective. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorites were left out. I imagined people asking, ""Where's steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?"" However, after long discussions, the TV team and I created a list that had something for everyone. This confirmed my belief that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on personal emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book's title, I never claimed the recipes were 'definitive.' But I thought that by using my technical skills and scientific knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could identify what made these dishes special. The dictionary defines 'perfection' as being perfect, but it also means improving through continuous experimentation. Trying ideas and revising them until you create something unique. The TV series allowed me to explore foods, people, and places I hadn't encountered before, which excited me as much as exploring memory and nostalgia in food. Searching for the best ingredients took me around the world. My adventures included being taken to a canning factory that processed the wrong type of tomato and visiting a dairy farm with standards so low we had to stop filming. Refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine, and nearly burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza."
107,"We were still hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise, swerved off the road into a field, and stopped. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking like he knew what he was doing. ‘Actually, I have no idea what I’m doing,’ he said eventually, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field stretched as far as I could see. There was nothing much in it, just grass and a lot of flowers like poppies and daisies. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I repeated, because it was always safest to agree with Bea. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat on the side of the road and watched John get smaller and smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay down next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’ So I told them about how the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them all the things the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather. I told them about the argument they had over a worm. ‘That’s silly, no one understands bird language,’ Bea said. My eyes stung. ‘I do.’ But my voice didn’t sound very convincing. ‘Liar.’ I blushed. How could I be lying if I remembered every single word? The more I thought about it, the more I wasn’t sure. ‘Mum…?’ But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea refused to get out. The boys didn’t seem to mind at all. They waved and smiled at her through the windows in the back door. We followed John into the tiled café. It was set back from the road and was not far from where our van was now parked. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘I think it might be a bit expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum reassured him, and we sat down in the shade of the terrace. The tea they brought was made from mint leaves and was very, very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ‘It’s like syrup in there,’ she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. ‘I suppose it’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said when it began to grow dark. Mum spread blankets on the ground. She made an open-air bed for us in the hotel garden. It was nice to go to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ‘I’ll have to have us towed into Marrakech,’ John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later we were sitting in the truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John at the wheel. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck himself. Now she sat in the front with the man who was driving. I kept wondering how we’d get home again now that our van had to be dragged everywhere. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her: one was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, whose name was Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing, their recent travels, and future plans. 

‘I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,’ Lucy told them. It sounded impressive, even though she didn’t really want to go. She often didn’t want to do the concerts and competitions that took her around the world, making her miss so much school that she wasn’t officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn’t even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group worldwide. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. But Lucy hadn’t applied herself; her mom had sent in the application and CD. ‘I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,’ her mom had said. Lucy thought it was more about not giving her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy believed that causing trouble was the worst thing to do, so she didn’t think about trying to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward, surprised. ‘Tanglewood?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘How old are you?’ ‘Fifteen.’ He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ‘Wow.’ Lucy hadn’t meant to show off. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was just fitting in or bragging. ‘It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying...’ Liesel/Louisa excused herself, looking across the room as if she saw someone she needed to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed. ‘Have you ever been to Japan?’ He had long, shaggy hair, like many male musicians, to show they were rebel music nerds. ‘Once. When I was, like, eight.’ He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ‘Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.’ He took her arm and led her away. ‘And don't get too friendly with the competition.’ ‘They're not the competition.’ ‘Everyone is the competition.’ Her grandfather took her around the room, making her talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, only half-listening. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’ She liked that part—being somebody. Even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention she got. Being a concert pianist didn’t earn her any special respect from her school friends. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn’t know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. He’s hard to argue with, so I decided to see what experts say – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is a key part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just use media for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails as adults do – they live in it. It’s not about whether it’s good or bad – it’s about how you use it.’ How does our social networking compare with what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at the youth club, as today’s parents did when they were younger, to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. It helps teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and interact with peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity: you can post about your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see that others have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He says that using social media can help if you’re shy: ‘Communicating online can be more comfortable than face-to-face, and it can help you practice social skills in a less threatening environment.’ Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help if you’re quiet and have a special interest because they let you connect with others who share that interest. ‘If you’re one of only three people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel isolated. But if you find a social networking group of people who like the same thing, you can still be popular, just in a different way,’ he says. Pauline White, a digital education expert, told me something interesting: ‘It’s people your age who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people, and create their own content who are really using the potential of social networks.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasting, and blogging about what interests them. Photo-sharing sites, she says, are changing creativity. Keen photographers can connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interest. ‘This all adds to employability and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness – and you need to understand how it works to create customers. For example, if you develop a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they’re all potential customers. If you link all those networks, there’s your customer base.’ Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to collaborate with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is a key 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age.’"""
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first idea. However, my parents had a different plan for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to organize what many teenagers might consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" my parents kept saying before the trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There must be good reasons why!"" In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough space left in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" Leaving our comfortable home for smaller accommodations over five thousand miles, I wasn't the only one wondering what we were getting into. We headed west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even close to home, we had adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under the darkest starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway by a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way! The next day, we were up early and on the move again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to blend together, but each adventure was unique. We left our footprints in the Great Sand Dunes and moved on to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that tourist town hinted at what we would experience later. Climbing to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best left to Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of ancient and modern. Dodging construction traffic became normal. We laughed at the ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" managed by park volunteers, were common when traffic stopped to let a bear cross. Our close encounter with a bear on the road (and a worried park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its problems, couldn't dampen our spirits. It was a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service, but it offered the most amazing views. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to an exotic place to find something amazing. It was bittersweet to be home again, but at least I hadn't argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos of our journey to look through. I knew I would remember the unplanned and spontaneous moments the most.'"
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay because it was her final school year. Amy was happy to have the best room at the college, with its own kitchen and study area, and she also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still keep an eye on Amy, whether she liked it or not. So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. Rose only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and had never met her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose’s parents were not very excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and looked forward to knowing her granddaughter again. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past, which meant summer holidays were spent elsewhere. Rose was only ten when she last saw her grandmother, but her memories were happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and good at bringing people together. Within a week, Rose could expect dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical frail old lady and seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England. Dahlia and Rose had a 'talk' before the move. Rose was sensible and mature for her age. She knew about healthy eating, keeping fit, and getting enough sleep. But Rose wanted her independence. Living with Daisy would meet all her needs, but Rose wanted to play music loudly, invite friends over, or go out without asking permission every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late, and she didn’t want to be dragged around by her grandmother. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies only, Dahlia insisted. Rose was thrilled. They all agreed it would be about trust. Her grandmother would trust her to act maturely and make grown-up decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be overbearing. If either of them went too far, they would renegotiate. Rose had never been a wild child. Her few school friends were similar, so her school reports were always good and her exam results excellent. This worked in her favor. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, form bonds, and basically start her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced at it now. At least she knew this was the last time, as she would be starting her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new moment in time, a new piece in the mosaic of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger shares that her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a great achievement because it seemed challenging, and she wasn't interested in other activities like the Olympics. At 13, she decided to try writing a novel, which is now about to be published. When she told her former teacher, the teacher was surprised, thinking Charlotte would write a book at 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't see why she should wait to do something she might be good at.

On a winter afternoon at her publisher's office, I was surprised to see a teenager, even though I knew I was interviewing a 15-year-old author. Her book is impressive, with a confident and action-packed story. Nothing, except the heroine's age, suggests it was written by a teenager. A public relations representative is with us, but Charlotte doesn't need any help. She is independent, intelligent, and steady, avoiding overconfidence.

Charlotte admits she is young and doesn't have many life lessons to share. When asked about the complex moral issues in her book, she says she wanted to ask big questions, not answer them. She doesn't think her age limits her understanding of the world, but she doesn't claim to be wise either. She was interested in exploring responsibility.

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are portrayed in fiction. She believes there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager unaware of the world, and the socially awkward teen. She found these stereotypes annoying. She wonders why there aren't more stories about teenagers who are okay as they are. She feels that some writers unintentionally suggest teenagers can't know themselves because they lack experience, which can hurt their self-confidence.

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. Their books explore deep psychological and life themes, making her question if she could write something good. However, she praises a book called ""How Not to Write a Novel,"" which advises that if readers can predict the story, the suspense is lost.

Some might think Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get published. Her father's connection in publishing did get her book read initially. She acknowledges her luck, as getting a first novel read is tough, regardless of age. Charlotte believes every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, success depends on talent. She doesn't take her success for granted."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping, stepped forward and skied down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp fast and flew upwards, arms flailing. Even to us, something seemed wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly informed us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle stuff. On past skiing holidays, I enjoyed practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I knew I’d risk ridicule if I tried to join them. Then my parents decided on a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. It had a huge indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students leapt, trying new tricks, and landed in pits of foam cubes – not a realistic introduction to the slopes. After practising indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan assured us. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again. Land in the zone and you continue forward, minimizing impact. Land on the flat and you stop dead, which is painful. Hence the need for speed. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain and race towards the jump. My legs would almost go into reverse as I neared the launch point, so I came down onto the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I expected to hate being indoors, but bouncing was addictive. Some drills copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I was only aware before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as happy as me, and for a moment I felt proud. But that was short-lived. On the final run, I didn’t slow down as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed in the zone. Then I noticed both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and your nails dig into the harness. The ride stops suddenly, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There's a pause, then a sharp drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, then go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park.

Amusement parks, with their thrilling rides, are a huge industry. To create the excitement and escape that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it's a real challenge. They must create the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe, and also add new features to keep visitors interested.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense, but most techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the tracks made by specialist manufacturers.

I spoke to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it's about quickly changing between different forces so people feel excited but safe. It's a fine line between thrilling and uncomfortable.

To create a great ride, teams must build a strong story, like a space adventure or jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or steepest drops. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that designers need to love thrills to understand what passengers want and to test rides before they open.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect big changes soon. Virtual reality can add something extra, like painting an old rollercoaster, but the physical ride experience will remain the most important for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already accomplished a lot as a choreographer, creating works for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances occasionally. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day,’ she explains. As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching and working with young students. ‘A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re willing to take risks. They want success, but they don’t fully know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This incomplete picture of their skills means they accept even harsh criticism. They might still question me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’

When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There might be music I don’t like, but I still create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. That doesn’t mean starting over with a new piece. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces – it’d help lift the mood when rehearsals get tough. Unfortunately, I’m always working on big productions – the music is already written and can’t be changed.’

Miranda doesn’t want to attach herself to one institution. ‘I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to adapt each time I go somewhere new, rather than doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’

We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one tries to show viewers what life inside a dance company is really like. There was a scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I recognized it. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s painful to watch but not staged for the cameras. The public underestimates the work and dedication involved in ballet.’

I ask what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – comes together. Perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and can make up for a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. That’s disappointing.’

Miranda has done a wide range of work, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to label you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to develop expertise in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, though I might one day be known for one thing. For now, I want to broaden my horizons.’"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home on your sofa when there’s so much to experience outside? That conversation gave me the idea for my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend of mine was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. Not only was it the longest distance I have ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon.” When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.'"
117,"Text: 'When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I had traveled with before, was busy, so I decided a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I would be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although still puzzled, he showed me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we set off, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained a support boat would accompany us throughout and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to split us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I had hoped to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was delighted when I finally managed it on my own. The following days followed a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims grew longer, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.'"
118,"Text: 'Being a flight attendant is not easy. But since I started, I have traveled everywhere, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, have a lot of free time, and life is never boring – which makes it a great job for someone young like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school abroad, away from my family, so I always flew alone when school started and ended. Feeling lonely, I would ask the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers, and some let me. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for something new. There were many young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often highly qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say – more than just saying I loved to travel, as everyone else would say that too. Instead, I talked about my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job! I’d recommend this job to anyone, as there are many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there’s a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again!'"
119,"At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy watching the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Almost all the children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do have children who miss home at the start of the week. Surprisingly, it's not the really young ones who feel this way the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to call now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days, and at the end of their week's stay, they all thank us because they have had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. We do get parents who call all the time, asking how their child is doing, which is quite unnecessary. Often their son or daughter will be busy, playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back another time. We often get a certain type of child coming, typically dressed in expensive new clothes. Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why."
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors must also be skilled musicians, opened in London last year after five years in the USA, where it was voted ‘Best Musical’ four times! However, using an all-British cast was challenging. The UK has stricter rules on how many performances young actors can do each week – in the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, twice as many actors were needed in the UK. Fortunately, the director found many talented UK-based actors, and they’ve just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. Although the theatre in London is larger than the US venue, it’s been full every night, with everyone eager to hear the songs that first became popular in America. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. ‘It’s amazing that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have regular school lessons each day at the theatre. While the teacher is great, I miss my old school friends.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre offers special deals on tickets for schools. They absolutely loved it and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play along with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I didn’t know. Jamie guided me through it, and I was very pleased with myself when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s talent and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! While the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they’ve found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show’s on in London for another year, and is well worth seeing.'"
