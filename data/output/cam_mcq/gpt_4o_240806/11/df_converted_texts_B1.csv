1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts about where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you are also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This made people more aware that sharing everything online might have negative sides. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering dreams of wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize it can be risky and confusing.

This might sound sad, but don't lose hope. There is a guide for this future, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored and faced many challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with fame, all before social media existed. These first bloggers have already experienced what many of us are going through now. Before we forget their stories, we should learn from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was invented at Cern, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were interested in his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might appear on his site, and no topic was off-limits. His work was very open, but it also had a certain beauty that some might call art.

One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video called Dark Night. He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. He stopped the blog, but the problem remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you think it will make people like you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the web is not a separate world where we can say anything without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that while the web lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Text: 'Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we do not understand. Scientists usually agree with this idea because no one knows everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt they needed to warn the public about the film. They used strong words like ‘atrocious’ and ‘dangerous’ to describe it. This made the film seem interesting to watch. At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film said that new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being changed by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher showed that thoughts could change the shape of water molecules. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing because it is simple and clear. But scientists usually say, ‘Give me a break’. They mean that we need real proof that thoughts can change water. Nice pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the film’s claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties from a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force expanding the universe. This idea is supported by years of research in labs and observatories. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is pushed by a mysterious force called ‘dark energy’. Besides the film, other discoveries are also amazing. Neuroscientists found that our brain takes about half a second to process events, but we do not notice this delay. Anthropologists think they know where modern humans first lived and why they moved to other places. Some theorists say there are links between life on Earth and the universe’s design. Science is not finished. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Chaos and quantum uncertainty show limits to what we can know. Some physicists are trying to create a Theory of Everything to explain all forces and particles in one equation. Many people think the universe is best described in one word: incredible.'"
3,"Text: 'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My pattern is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and vice versa. The two types of writing might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch between them. I began my career with two short novels in 1975, and from 1984 to 1985, I started writing short stories. I knew little about it then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. I felt my fictional world expand. Readers seemed to like this other side of me as a writer. One of my first works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can be endless). It’s not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That’s it. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I’ll make it. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small things – an idea, a word, an image. It’s like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn’t work, you just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t make every short story a masterpiece. This comforts me. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also brought dangers. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it doesn't always succeed. It influences poets, politicians, and thinkers. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, and its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes think science is more or less important than it really is, and they often ignore its mistakes or exaggerate them. Science is full of conflicts. Old ideas are often changed or replaced by new ones, just like in music. New ideas are sometimes laughed at but can become the new standard. Scientists can be jealous and angry. The history of science is about conflict. This book will talk about ideas in science that changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical things like non-stick pans. We will admire these ideas but also question them, knowing that human minds have limits. Science is always changing. Scientists often prove each other wrong. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they change our beliefs. In the 17th century, science showed us a universe like a big clock. Three centuries later, physics made us question basic ideas, showing us that observing the universe can change it. Some people think science can't explain everything, but it often helps us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps going. At the end of the 19th century, many thought there was nothing new to discover in physics, but then came many new discoveries like radioactivity and quantum mechanics. Biology has also made many discoveries. Some people now say we are close to a complete theory of everything. Maybe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature more, sometimes upsetting its balance. We need to watch science carefully. People who are not scientists need to understand scientific advances because they affect the world and future generations. Science is now part of how we plan and control our future. This is not just a question for philosophers. The answers can affect national budgets, the health of future children, and even life on Earth."
5,"Text: 'Around 2015, after years of growth, big publishers noticed that ebook sales stopped growing or even went down. This made people question the future of ebooks in publishing. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, as his company lost faith in 'the power of the word on the page'. Even though digital and print books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will 'kill' print books. Whether predicting or dismissing this, the idea of books disappearing makes us think and debate. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see ebooks and print books as fighting, even if the facts say otherwise? The answers are not just about ebooks; they show how we feel about new things and change. In my research, I found that people often think one new technology will replace another. Before digital tech, people thought new inventions would end old media. For example, when TV was invented, many thought radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn't new. In 1894, people thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This has happened many times. Movies, radio, TV, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some said losing books would harm culture, while others thought ebooks were much better. The idea of books dying comes up during times of tech change. This story shows our hopes and fears about new technology. We form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we bond with things like books and computers, even naming our cars or getting mad at our laptops. So, when new tech like e-readers comes, it changes our bond with things we use every day. As tech changes, we miss what we used to have. This is why industries grow around old products and tech. When the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. The move from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people miss silent films. The same happened with analog to digital photography and vinyl records to CDs. E-readers made people appreciate 'old' books and even their smell. This should comfort those worried about print books disappearing. But the idea of a disappearing medium will keep being a popular story about tech change and our dislike of change. We use stories of tragedy and ending to understand change. The story of the death of the book shows our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves.'"
6,"Text: 'Almost every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years managed their daily work. I wanted to see how they found time each day to be creative and productive. By writing about the simple details of their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to show them as people with habits, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.’ I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.’ In this way, my book is about the conditions of creative work, not the work itself. It’s about how things are made, not what they mean. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever thought that even writing a business letter shows something about your inner self. My book looks at questions I struggle with: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to focus completely on one project or to work on it a little each day? When there isn’t enough time for everything, do you have to give things up, or can you learn to do more in less time? I don’t have all the answers, but I have tried to show how different successful people have faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas come from small daily actions; how your work habits affect your work, and vice versa. The book’s title is Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary, but it can also be a way to use your time, willpower, and optimism wisely. A good routine helps you focus your mental energy and avoid being controlled by your moods. The psychologist William James thought you should put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself often procrastinated and couldn’t keep a regular schedule. This book started from my own procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, I was alone at the small architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a ‘morning person’ who can focus well in the early hours but not after lunch. That afternoon, to feel better about this, I started looking online for information about other writers’ work schedules. I found many interesting stories. I thought someone should collect these stories in one place – so I started the Daily Routines blog that afternoon, and now, this book. The blog was simple; I posted descriptions of people’s routines as I found them in biographies, magazine profiles, and newspaper obituaries. For the book, I’ve collected a much larger and better-researched set of routines, while keeping the short and varied voices that made the blog popular. I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves as much as possible, using quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I’ve summarized their routines from other sources. I should mention that this book wouldn’t be possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also guide further reading.'"
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, had a big loan and was worried about how the economy would affect him. He said that the planned holiday to Spain was no longer possible. Instead, they rented a small house on the English coast. On a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. He knew for a long time that he wanted to be a palaeontologist, and by the end of university, he knew what kind he wanted to be. He was interested in the very early times, not in dinosaurs. He studied small creatures in grey rocks. When he finished his doctoral thesis, he wondered if he would get a job, especially in the kind of place he wanted. He believed in himself but knew that deserving something doesn't always mean you get it. When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied, but he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of Howard’s interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had an argument with his wife, crashed his car, and went to the hospital. The interview happened without him, and the professor who replaced him wanted to stop the appointment of his rival’s favorite candidate. This helped Howard get the job. Howard was surprised by the support from someone he didn’t know and was grateful until a colleague explained what really happened. Howard was a little disappointed but happy to have the job he wanted. He often thought about how his work life was organized, but personal life could be chaotic. He realized that strangers could change your life, like when his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, Howard went back to the college, postponed the lecture, and reported the theft. He then had coffee with a colleague and a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This is how Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that would be his biggest challenge and secure his career. If not for the theft, he wouldn’t have known. He quickly changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence will eat almost anything. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. These larvae might look like maggots, but they have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. Making bug-eating normal is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the flavors we taste. His research is quietly changing what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink, a field informally called gastrophysics. They look at who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates and cutlery, and background noise—all of which affect taste. Spence’s book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, is full of interesting facts for anyone who likes food. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant enjoys their food the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence’s lab in Oxford is simple and low-tech. There are soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford research. Much of his work is funded by a big food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less serious in universities. But now, since the government wants universities to show their work has an impact, this research is seen as valuable. Spence is helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar, often because of government rules. They do it slowly so customers don’t notice the change. ""Research shows that if you tell people about the changes, they focus on the taste and don’t like it as much,"" he says. Spence met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project. People used to think science and food didn’t mix, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal and Spence created the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish, which uses sound to enhance flavor. Spence says that the Italian futurists were doing similar things a century ago, but it didn’t become popular. Now, the food industry uses Spence’s sensory science widely. For example, higher-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and lower-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with food for passengers. Last year, a brand released an app that played music while ice cream softened, but they didn’t match the music to the taste, which Spence says happens often. What are dinner parties like at Spence’s home? Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled lights. They’ve had parties with a tone generator, headphones, and different drinks to see if they have different pitches. For Spence, home, shops, food events, and conferences are all part of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We get a lot of information, some true and some not, and we have to decide what is important. We also do more things ourselves now. For example, we book our own flights and find things in shops without help. We try to manage our lives, families, jobs, hobbies, and TV shows, often using our smartphones. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing many things at once, but this is not true. Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. We actually switch quickly from one task to another, which makes us less efficient. Multitasking increases stress hormones, which can make us feel confused. It also makes our brains want more new things, which distracts us. The part of the brain that helps us focus is easily distracted by new things. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a psychologist, found that trying to focus on a task while having an unread email can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This is worse than being tired. Russ Poldrack, a scientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV, the information goes to a part of the brain that stores skills, not facts. Without TV, it goes to a part that organizes information better. Multitasking also involves making decisions, which is hard for our brains. Even small decisions use a lot of brain power, and after many small decisions, we might make bad big decisions. Many people, including business leaders and scientists, say email is a big problem. It's not email itself, but the large amount of communication. One scientist's son said his dad's job is ""answering emails,"" which is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do that and other tasks."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions would not have been important. Scientists studied animal behaviors and their results, but they did not think animals had feelings or moral systems. Recently, this has started to change. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens is beginning to explore animal emotions. This change has led to popular science books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate: do animals have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong? In a recent experiment, cows had to open a locked gate to get food. Cows that opened the gate themselves showed more happiness by jumping and kicking than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? The observations are clear, but their meaning is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature,"" believes we should stop eating meat. He thinks we are near a big change in ethics, like when slavery ended. Aubrey Manning, a professor at Edinburgh University, says we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He believes animals have a simpler version of a ""theory of mind"" than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. The disagreement is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is hard, can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an experiment that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can feel depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were put in two groups. One group lived in nice cages with space and water, while the other group lived in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. Later, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages ate them. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt pessimistic. Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, has a strong opinion. He says, ""We look back with horror at times of racism. One day, we will feel the same about how we treat animals. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger."" If Balcombe were alone in his views, it might be easy to dismiss him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning, who wrote a textbook on animal behavior, says, ""We are seeing a change. In the early 20th century, some thought animals were like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are changing again. It is a difficult topic, and we should avoid personal opinions."""
11,"Text: 'Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or listen to. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that argument can help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve problems and make it harder to think deeply. West says we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More data does not always mean better knowledge or decisions. The National Endowment for the Arts says reading has dropped by 10%, and this might affect critical thinking. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes focusing on visual media can reduce critical thinking. She says people now prefer real-time media and multi-tasking over focusing on one thing. We don't yet know exactly how technology affects critical thinking. Technology can be both good and bad. For example, a computer game might help or hurt critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis, but too many links can stop deep thinking. Greenfield says technology changes how we think. Reading helps imagination and critical thinking more than video games and TV, but visual media can improve some information processing. Most visual media do not allow time for reflection or imagination. This can lead to people, especially young ones, not reaching their full potential. How we see technology affects our views on critical thinking. Video games and thinking skills are a big topic. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says video games can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills. They let players explore ideas in virtual worlds. As reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis.'"
12,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and motorcycle mechanic. He left his office job because he was unhappy with it. His first book talks about the benefits of manual work. His latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book when he saw ads on a credit card machine while shopping. Crawford noticed that these ads are hard to ignore and take our attention away from what we want to think about. This makes it difficult to remember conversations or think deeply. Because of this, people avoid talking to strangers and prefer to be alone.

Crawford says we often see the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can control our desires. Many people are worried about this. For example, some office workers complain about emails but spend their free time checking them. Studies show that just seeing a phone on a table can distract us. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing.

Crawford believes technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves. We often choose to send text messages instead of talking to people. This can make us lose important social connections. He gives an example of his gym, where people used to share music. Now, everyone listens to their own music with earphones, which makes the gym less social.

Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public places. More importantly, he thinks we should engage in skilled activities, like cooking or playing sports, to connect with the real world. These activities require good judgment and interaction with others. They help us focus on real experiences instead of digital ones. This doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but it's important to use our judgment. Focusing on one thing can help us pay attention to what really matters."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, we answer this question in a few words. But when you are a philosopher, like me, it is a bit harder. Saying you are a philosopher can sound pretentious. People might think you claim to know some special truth. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why do people think this way about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) said that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, was the best. Few modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked with thinking deeply. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just accepting what everyone else does is not satisfying. Thinking about life helps us make our own decisions. But you don’t need to read a lot of philosophy books to think about life. It means looking closely at our daily experiences to see if they are important. It doesn’t mean living away from society. In fact, thinking about life should be practical and shared with others. This is part of a good life. Another reason people misunderstand philosophers is that academic philosophy has become distant from everyday life. This is not all the philosophers' fault. Universities focus on expensive and hard-to-access journals. So, philosophers often only talk to other experts. For most people, philosophy seems far from reality. If philosophers once tried to change this view, many have stopped. Universities created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. Some areas of philosophy are now very technical, making it hard to explain to non-experts. Philosophy, in some cases, has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about judging human actions. But I feel this title is not enough because ethics is often linked to rules and laws. Recently, ethics has come to mean applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. Ethicists today decide if something is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often think about them. But philosophy is more than this. A discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is wrong (it is) and then look at responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps us examine the actions and beliefs that shape our lives. Sometimes we find what we already know; other times, we see our beliefs are hard to defend. By examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. Historically, though, philosophers have not focused much on food itself. Instead, they often used eating as a way to talk about other ideas, like learning. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related topics. 

An interesting example is the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. He talked about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many parts of life. However, his name is now often linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and recipe websites. These businesses likely hope that being associated with a famous philosopher will help them sell more.

Food is social and cultural. It comes from history and is shared with others in our communities. These communities give us people to eat with and the systems to grow and share food. We interact with food more often and in more basic ways than with any other product, making it an important topic to think about.

Once food is made, critics talk and write about it. But why do they have such a special role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill, but that food critics are just better at describing tastes. This area has not been studied much because most research on perception focuses on sight, not taste.

Another part of food is its beauty. We often say paintings or music are beautiful, but not food. Some philosophers think that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. But food is eaten and disappears, unlike art or music, which last over time. So, some say food cannot be considered in the same way.

There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-genetically modified foods? Our choices often show our beliefs. Philosophers ask why we make these choices, and discussing this is important.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests because of personal relationships. At home, everyone shares food and friendship. Professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food. Their kitchens are for qualified people, and their relationships are professional.

A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways. First, we can appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food. Second, eating together helps us connect with people from different cultures, a practice used in international diplomacy. The essay includes many interesting examples and stories, making this part of food philosophy engaging for readers.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. So, he thought about how board games could change. Could they have a story? Could choices in one game affect the next one? He changed a classic game called Risk to make a new version: Risk Legacy. In this game, choices made during play have a lasting effect. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and past actions become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau then worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players try to stop diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very popular, SeaFall was a big test for the legacy style because it was not based on an earlier game. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players explore and conquer new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said: ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to have problems, and you have to fix everything.’

Legacy games were not expected to become very popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a small interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is different and good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks many rules. I thought only a few people would like it.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it’s a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, liked the adventure of legacy games more than worrying about the game lasting. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and ruining the board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It’s like the stories in video games.’ The legacy style is influenced by video games and popular TV series. Daviau wanted to be a TV writer in college but moved to advertising and then game design. He still loved telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares making a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how it starts and ends,’ he said. ‘But you also need more than just an outline.’

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is interested in seeing what others do with the idea. But he also thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, believes the legacy style is a big change. ‘It changes how you think about what a board game can be,’ he said."
16,"Text: 'One night not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online and seemed like something from a children's movie. Stories like this, about animals escaping, are fun because we like to think animals are like us. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very smart but look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play in complex ways. 

Some people think it's unscientific to say animals are like humans, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, disagrees. He says that not recognizing human-like traits in animals, which he calls anthropodenial, is more common. He has studied animal behavior for many years and found that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we often think.

In the past, people thought animals were smart enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even in the nineteenth century, scientists like Charles Darwin believed that the difference between human and animal minds was one of degree, not kind. But in the twentieth century, people started to see animals as machines that respond to stimuli or as robots with instincts. This view came at a time when humans were destroying animal habitats and not caring for animal welfare.

Dr. de Waal believes we are now starting to see animal intelligence as similar to human intelligence, though not the same. He says that the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique skills of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we are not smart because we can't change our skin color.

Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean, but he knows that stories like Inky's help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got upset. This study was published in a scientific journal, but a video of the experiment convinced more people. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways.'"
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once only in science fiction, is now a major technological change. Robots have been used in car and manufacturing industries for many years. Experts say robots will soon be used in many more areas, but many countries are not ready for this big change. Most people know robots will change jobs. About two-thirds of people think robots will do most jobs in 50 years, but 80% think their own jobs will still exist. This is not true: all job areas will be affected by robots soon. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that takes two people almost a day. In San Francisco, a company called Simbe Robotics made Tally, a robot that checks if supermarket shelves are stocked and priced correctly. People who support robots say they will create new jobs for technicians and programmers. Critics say we need to remember the importance of human skills. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots will change jobs. His team says that in two years, one-third of robots will be smarter and work with humans. In three years, many big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will make laws about robots. In five years, salaries in robotics will go up by 60%, but many jobs will be empty because there are not enough skilled workers. Zhang says lower-skilled workers will be affected and need to retrain. New robots will also be made for homes and will interact with us in new ways. This is a big chance for companies, but also a challenge because we need new rules for safety and privacy. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future. Countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once answered a reporter's question about why he wanted to climb Mount Everest by saying, ""Because it's there."" The reporter was asking a question many people have: why would someone do something so dangerous? Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams. It suggests that climbing is about adventure and fun. 

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He described seven different types of climbing, each with its own rules. He said that the way you climb should depend on the rules of the type of climbing you are doing. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in the climbing community.

Many climbers love climbing because it makes them feel free. However, climbing can also be limiting, like when a storm traps you in a tent. This shows a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. But some say that having fewer choices makes life simpler, which is a kind of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He thinks climbing is in our genes. We naturally want to take on challenges and test our limits, even if it's risky. So, the joy of climbing might be more about biology than logic.

US academic Brian Treanor wrote that climbing can help develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He believes these virtues are important in today's world, which often avoids risk. Climbing can help people develop traits that are useful in everyday life.

Some climbers believe that climbing without help from others or technology requires total commitment. Experts Ebert and Robinson argued that climbing is more impressive when done independently, without things like bottled oxygen. This idea caused some controversy because it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Climbing can also be understood by looking beyond Western ideas. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone"" while climbing. The physical effort, meditation, and problem-solving involved in climbing are similar to techniques in Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,"Text: 'For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became very important in classical music. He was a serious and thoughtful person who played and recorded many famous European piano pieces. He wrote and played a lot, but he did not teach much. People who knew him well saw that he could be fun, but he did not show this side in his concerts. His life was full of study, travel, and performances. 

Then, four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take him seriously. He had not taught many students and did not plan to start. He said, ‘You don’t hire a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something special about Kit, who was about 14 years old then. Brendel listened to him play. He said, ‘Kit played very well and from memory. He gave me a CD of a small concert he did, and he played so beautifully that I thought, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that took you from the first to the last note. It’s rare to find a musician with this kind of understanding and skill.’

As Brendel is leaving the public stage, Kit is starting to enter it, but Brendel is careful that Kit does not get too tired too soon. Kit, now 19, is always busy when not in lessons. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, or plays tennis, all with his mother watching over him. He also composes music. Brendel says, ‘This is very important. Learning to read music well is easier if you try to write music yourself. I noticed Kit has an amazing memory and can read music at first sight very well. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and to me when I explain something. He not only understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it appears again.’

Brendel stops and looks serious. ‘I don’t want to raise expectations. I get upset if newspapers do this. One article called him the future great pianist of the 21st century. It’s the worst thing. You don’t say that in a newspaper. It has caused a lot of problems. Like many talented young players, he can play some things very well, but others need more time and experience. It would be bad if a critic expected perfect playing.’

Now at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed in his life after performing. He says, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. When I was 50, I had done most of them, but there was still more to do, so I continued. Even though I don’t have the physical strength now, in my mind, there are always things happening, pieces I’ve never played. I don’t play now, but it’s a nice new career.’'"
20,"When I was little, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden was not in a dirty city. It was by a river and gently sloped down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – places of peace and quiet. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass was broken.

At home, my father was often quiet. He wasn’t without humor, though. He liked to say things like, ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ instead of just saying, ‘I don’t mind.’ He probably wished he had done more with his life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber. Plumbing wasn’t his passion; it was just his job. He wasn’t very ambitious, though he and Mum once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was very good at fixing things around the house, like making bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once. But my mother liked to change the furniture often. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn’t get lessons, she said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

I loved going to the river. I would go there with a fishing net and sandals that were too small, with the fronts cut out for my toes. I’d find a spot to leave my sandals and picnic, then look for fish to catch with my net. After trying to keep them alive at home, I would put them back in the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as I could, but it seemed unlikely until my father said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ My dad might have preferred me to be a carpenter, but I think he hoped things would work out if I tried hard. Even though he didn’t like gardening, he saw how much I loved it and noticed my passion for plants."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I do the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the steep cliff and into the ocean 120 meters below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes up to him, and MacEwen gently strokes him. The wind is strong, but MacEwen feels comfortable here on his island. He is giving me a tour of his neighborhood. Pointing to the north, he shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds dropping rain on its big mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says, ‘I have sheep to move,’ as rain comes towards us. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Volcanic Muck is three km long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep stops our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to gather the sheep but is not doing well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen says, meaning the dog should go to the right. But Tie goes straight into the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says with disappointment. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin, who is newly married, manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They go out and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But island life has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I get used to it, along with no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone in the drawer.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck seems surprisingly nice. Today, the boat brings some groceries and three musicians, who get off with their instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with the islanders tapping their boots to the music. That night, sitting by a warm fire as it rains outside, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father saw a small farm on the isle of Soay in the newspaper and bought it without seeing it. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know anything about running a farm? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the small island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I carry it back through the village and give it to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is very delicious. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to my next island. In the last two months, many ferries had been canceled because of high seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, phone or no phone, was what I secretly hoped for."
22,"Text: 'At first, the game design industry was mostly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It didn't have many ways for others to join. People often thought of video games as just a hobby for young people, but now the industry is taken seriously. Industry experts are not surprised. Making video games is not easy. Games that come out quickly after a new movie need many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it is hard to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, who speaks for an online games magazine, says: ‘It’s hard to make progress in big companies or to influence big games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just the directors who lead a whole game, but also the people who design parts of the game.’ So, how can you join this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim disagrees. ‘The only way is to make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something. Game design is more a way of life than just a job. Like any creative work, you have to do it to make it real.’ Another expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s a lot to be said for “just doing it”, but it’s more complicated. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs; even fewer have the talent, technical skills, vision, and business ability to really help the industry grow.’ Can you do it alone? ‘Maybe, but it’s hard,’ says John. ‘A good postgraduate course in games can help and give support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and move up. They are interested in all kinds of entertainment and arts. They might have worked a few years after graduation and then decided games are their “thing”. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and know about the growing variety of games. Connections can also help. To get ahead in games, you need to network.’ The idea of a young boy always playing games is outdated. Now, games are seen as a grown-up activity. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. ‘Games are popular with large audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see many new opportunities in this area.’"
23,"Text: 'Since I was a child, all I wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I'm thankful for that. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy. He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and never played football again. I'm glad it didn't happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score a great goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but it's not. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. Only by practicing can you score amazing goals. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice for many years. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned technique. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know now that education is important, but football was all I thought about then. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't notice it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope he doesn't just want to kick them around like I did. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so young players could join the first team, but he didn't make a big deal about it. He never said, ‘This is your big chance,’ but we knew it was. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost, and a TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely on close friends and family a lot. But having a lot of money can cause problems. People say, ‘I can’t believe you let your mother keep working.’ I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car last Christmas. My family is strong and would be upset if they thought they should be on my payroll. My mum doesn't earn much as a hairdresser, but she loves her job. I like using my money to help people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think, and it doesn't solve everything. After I stop playing, I want to take a year off to do things I couldn't do before. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I break a leg skiing and can't play football, I wouldn't be insured.'"
24,"Text: 'We were living at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He offered to find us a cheap place to live because my father couldn’t write in Los Angeles. Sam was worried about losing clients and money. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point was not popular with day trippers. The road was not nice, and the nearby resort of La Carmella was more attractive. Only people with little money or those who loved surfing came to Reef Point. But now, with the hot weather, many people came. After months of being alone, we were surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to write a script and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. When we first moved to Reef Point, we didn’t have a dog, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I gave him water, and my father threw a boot at him, but not seriously. Rusty knew this and stayed closer. I asked my father, ‘Who do you think he belongs to? He seems to think he belongs to us.’ My father said, ‘You’re wrong, Jane. He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often brought me things he found. Sometimes he brought things that weren’t his, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, and I had to return them. He liked to swim too and always came with me, even though I swam faster. He never got discouraged. We had been swimming that day. My father, having finished his script, went to Los Angeles to deliver it. Rusty and I spent the afternoon together at the beach. As the sun set, it got cooler, and we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. They rode the waves with great balance. One surfer caught my eye. She was very skilled. She decided to stop and rode in on a final wave. ‘Hi,’ she said, ‘why didn’t you join us?’ ‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’ ‘You could get one.’ ‘No money.’ ‘You’re British, aren’t you? Are you visiting?’ ‘No, I live here.’ ‘Is your father American?’ ‘No. He came here to write the film script of a novel he wrote.’ ‘Really? What’s his name?’ ‘Rufus Marsh.’ ‘You mean, Tall as the Morning?’ I nodded. ‘I read that book.’ She looked at me with new interest. People were friendly but only interested when I mentioned Tall as the Morning.'"
25,"Violet Hetherington asked herself, ""What have I done?"" She was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton. The lines were spilling out of the building marked ""Departures"" to board the Queen Caroline, and none were moving. Her friend Annie had advised her to arrive late, saying, ""If you get there too early, you can get bored waiting."" Annie, who was married to a diplomat, traveled a lot and often gave advice. But this time, her advice was wrong. After a while, an announcement came over the speakers: there was a ""breakdown in the computer system."" This made the waiting passengers upset. Some tried to be patient, and a few even tried to stay cheerful, but most were unhappy. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and it might be their last chance for some luxury. The fact that they couldn't even board the ship efficiently was not a good sign. Violet wanted to leave. She looked in her bag for her phone and realized it was missing. This was more annoying than the long lines. It made her feel that going on a cruise was a mistake. Now, she had the problem of the missing phone. She couldn't call the taxi company to check if she left it in the cab because the number was stored in her phone. Her older son, Harry, always told her to avoid this mistake. Behind her in the line was a friendly-looking couple. ""I'm sorry, but I seem to have left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make one call?"" Violet asked. She called Harry on the couple's phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbor, to check if the phone was in her flat. If it wasn't there, she would be in trouble because she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, ""Thank goodness,"" but she didn't tell Harry this. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother. Her younger son, Daniel, was more understanding of her mistakes because he made them too. Dan might forget to give the message to Kristina. Finally, the lines started to move, and Violet handed over her travel documents and got ready to board. Her heart sank when she saw the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were shiny fake wood panels, lots of chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets like those in airports. Violet followed the signs to the ""Elevators,"" which were lined with mirrors and full of tired passengers. She was squashed against the side of the lift as it went up, stopping at each floor to let people out. At last, on the twelfth floor, she stepped out. Thankfully, her room had the balcony she had asked for. She had been worried about what to say if it didn't. Ignoring Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she had paid the highest price she could afford to make sure she had a view of the sea."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he didn't know he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was looking for pictures for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing interesting pictures. Since then, Maloof has collected many of Maier’s belongings. In his attic, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked at all of it and realized he had found something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’

For some time, Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They talked to families who hired her as a nanny and to people at the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit unusual, always had a camera with her. She wore large coats, wide hats, and strong shoes. ‘On her day off, she would leave with her camera in the morning and return late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’

Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Although she wasn’t very social, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed very dedicated to her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; she didn’t do it for money. Her photos often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. ‘What is interesting about Vivian is that there are so many fascinating pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of other photographers in her work and wonders if she developed her style on her own. ‘Was Vivian very skilled or did she take ideas from others?’

Maloof often wonders if he will ever look through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. The funny thing is he wasn’t interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I realized it was the people and street scenes that mattered to her,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to her work than I thought. Now our goal is to make her name known. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.’"
27,"Text: 'When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when the book was very popular, but she was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer. The officer looked at it and asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are a series of crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past gave more chances for complications and misunderstandings for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I ask how it feels to be successful at a young age, she says, ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels like the success is partly theirs. There’s a family feeling at home, and I got a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.’ Then she adds, ‘What is annoying is when people think I’m not trying to do something philosophical in the book.’ ‘I wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part was half the length of the one before it,’ said Catton. The book speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters if the reader notices this. ‘I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them,’ she says. Despite the book's experimental structure, it is still an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she says she didn’t plan the book beforehand. ‘I would write myself into a corner and then see how creative I could be to get out of it.’ It’s clear she also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We also talk about her love of TV drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers, different viewpoints, and dialogue, I ask if she might be interested in screenwriting. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she says. Her conversation is full of enthusiasm, with a low, secretive laugh. She becomes excited when talking about her work and New Zealand. ‘I always notice when I come to Britain how my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to busy areas, to be around many people.’ But for now, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I hope it gives her the inspiration she needs for many more novels.'"

As a boy, Jonny Kinkead loved making things in his dad’s garage and playing the guitar. These two hobbies have been his job for the last forty years: he builds steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still amazed by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood make such a beautiful sound? And by using different types of wood, you get different sounds. It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a holiday job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and types of wood changed the sound, and how to put them together.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ‘We drew model boats and airplanes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use saws, sharpen chisels, and things like that. I’d also been fixing instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar was good, but he didn’t think about a career in building guitars. ‘I also liked painting and sculpture,’ he says. After school, he decided to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he remembers. But halfway through, he left the course. ‘I was too individualistic for it,’ he says. ‘But I left with a clearer idea of what I wanted to do. I still liked sculpture, but I realized that building guitars is like sculpture – it’s about shaping sound. And I thought it might be more practical than pure art because you make things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only covered the cost of the materials, but as he became known as a great guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just making a living’. He admits he can only make ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. In the early years, he worked hard to get known. He went to music festivals most weekends and got musicians to try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments – when musicians asked, he didn’t have an answer because it wasn’t natural for him. Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the only good acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as real, even though we’ve always had good instrument-making courses and the skills have stayed the same. But now our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says you can learn valuable techniques in the classroom, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take courses. However, he also believes there is no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see where people have succeeded or failed, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you’re taught by someone else, you only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’"
29,"Text: 'When talking about English conversation, we must start with the weather. This is a tradition, and many writers mention the famous comment by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist, who said, ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This is still true today. Many people try to explain why English people talk so much about the weather, but they often fail. They think English people talk about the weather because they are interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not exciting, so he finds the interest in it strange. He notes that England does not have extreme weather like tornadoes or blizzards. On the other hand, English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman argues that the weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. He says that living near the ocean and a continent means you never know what weather you will get. 

However, my research shows that both Bryson and Paxman miss the point. English people do not talk about the weather because they care about it. Instead, weather talk is a way to help English people start conversations. Phrases like ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ or ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ are not really about the weather. They are greetings or ways to start a conversation. This is similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially. 

There are specific times when English people use weather talk. It can be a greeting, a way to start a conversation, or a topic to fill a silence. This means English people use weather talk often, so others think they are obsessed with it. An English conversation might start with weather talk, use it to break the ice, and return to it if there is a pause. This is why people from other countries, and even some English people, think the English are very interested in the weather.'"
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was for the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip over trips to Spain, Greece, or France. But they really wanted to know why the Wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. When she couldn't find a historical novel to help explain life at the Wall in Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. She felt it was a big change. ‘Teaching is like acting, it’s a performance every day and very tiring. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but not as exhausting. My old teaching friends are jealous because I still connect with children through my books.’ Alice wants her novels to fill a gap in children’s fiction today. ‘Many books for teenagers now are about negative experiences. They are well written,’ she adds, ‘but many are dark or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’ Alice always tried to teach English and History together, like lessons about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy, and she loves seeing children go from bored to interested. She sees her writing as an extension of teaching. She was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market and because her two sons were leaving home. Her head teacher also suggested she try a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course I didn’t think I needed.’ Before the course, she had to send her best piece of fiction, which she found out just days before leaving. ‘I sat at the computer and created a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted. During the course, other students liked her story and suggested she publish it. With only 8,000 report cards as proof of her writing skills, she asked her head teacher for a year off to write her first novel. Alice’s husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and he helped edit her novel. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve written – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep adding another scene. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,"Text: 'To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. This race would be man against car, and brother against brother. In the wild Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same place. Jonny would drive a car on roads, and Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. ‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and it’s very cold now, so I’ll be warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. Unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, Alistair wore full winter cycling clothes. He wasn’t worried about the cold. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll even make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’ The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and would finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, 350 metres up. This was no problem for the car, but Alistair’s first miles had a steep 25 per cent incline, so he had a tough start. After a quick handshake, they began. Alistair raced on his bike up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss. Jonny got in the car and started driving. The next time they would see each other was at the finish line. Who would get there first? Jonny’s early confidence was quickly tested. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first problem. A giant tractor came out of a field and onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he said to the cameraman in his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!’ After the tractor was gone, Jonny was back on the road. Alistair was struggling with the slope. A few miles in, he had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched as he kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side, there was open ground. With the sun out, he could show his skills. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair picked up speed. In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The villages in Yorkshire are old, and the roads are not made for speed. Jonny tried to drive through a narrow corner. The car slowed down, then passed through a stream on the road. After the last village, the car raced to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped to Fleet Moss, Alistair was crossing his last field and back on the road, coming to the finish from the other side. Head down, legs moving fast… and then he stopped at the line. Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the crowd. ‘No? Really?’ He raised his arms. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, Jonny arrived and got out of the car. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said, feeling disappointed. ‘I’m gutted.’'"
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds make you feel separate from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hard to focus only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused that I forget there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, always told me this was the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was telling my friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not so hard. I was just happy to be there at twenty years old. Federer beat me easily because I didn’t believe in myself enough. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have done better, and it was my mind that failed me, not my skills. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, who is a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me; he even criticizes me when I win. But I was so upset that he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might have been my last chance to win. I know a professional athlete’s career is short, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments are more important, and I missed a big one in 2007. Toni couldn’t make me feel better. But he was right. I got another chance. Here I was again in 2008, just one year later. I was sure I learned from that defeat; this time, my mind would not fail me. The best sign that my mind was ready was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family and friends the night before the final, at the house we rent when I play at Wimbledon, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to talk about it, but they knew I was already playing the match in my mind. Until the start of play, that space in my mind was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: 'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall arrived in Africa in April 1957. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ‘I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood.’ She spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain’s National Geographical Society made Jane Goodall famous with articles and TV documentaries about her research on chimpanzees. Her fame grew with her own writing, including children's books and the 1971 bestseller In the Shadow of Man, translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century. However, her fame sometimes hides her real achievements. Many articles and books tell her life story, but they often focus on her adventures rather than her work. Jane Goodall should be seen as a pioneer in her field and a leading zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We also did not know that they have emotions and social systems similar to ours. Her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), is a key work in chimpanzee research. Her study of wild apes in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves. Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. When she was five, she disappeared one day. The police and neighbors searched for her. She reappeared with straw in her hair and clothes. She explained that she wanted to see how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours. This curiosity was an early sign of her future as a biologist.'"
34,"Text: 'During our first, hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using the voice of a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are known to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to say lots of medical words.’ Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors think they can do funny voices, and many of them probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it than that. You have to make the script come alive for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get the parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course, thinking of a normal acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a big part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and many forms, which production companies on tight schedules want to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of a job that includes many things from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and happy. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; working with other actors makes a big difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that help voiceover artists make them.’ She says she got where she is – near the top of her profession – through hard work as much as natural talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practising your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a love for human sound is important, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a certain kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’'"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people give up these dreams and choose more realistic jobs, like being a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can make a living by drawing doodles like those in school notebooks seems silly. Yet, some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. 

For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school publications, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and showed my drawings to different companies after graduating. I was lucky to find a newspaper looking for political cartoons. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to live on.

To be a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical skills needed are not high, but it’s still a tough job. You shouldn’t try to be a cartoonist unless you feel you can’t do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the bills and leaves time for family and hobbies.

The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t refuse any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about everything.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are almost over. Today, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to create and sell your work. Cartoonists with average talent but good business skills often do better than artistic geniuses who lack business sense.

I often meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they won’t let others see their work! To protect your work, just draw a small ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it might actually be a lucky break!"
36,"Text: 'Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and clearing out old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually hate getting rid of things, so why did I want to throw this away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of trash when a young man came up to me. He looked confused and asked, ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ I said I was, but I already felt a bit sorry. He asked if he could have it, and I said ‘Yes’. We went our separate ways. In the years after, I felt sad about what I’d done. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. That’s how I felt when I read the email from a man named Keith Rushton, a dealer and restorer of guitars. He said, ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’ The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back. He used my name to find me online and contacted me through the newspaper I work for. He offered to sell it back to me. I almost cried. I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was fair. I had forgotten my dad’s habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this story! My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s because it was popular. I loved its calming sound, but I couldn’t make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where people who couldn’t play well could still be rock stars. When I got my old guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Picking it up again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then stood up and put a strap over my shoulder because the electric guitar is played standing. My fingers knew where to go. I couldn’t draw a diagram of the chords, but my hands just played them. My fingers felt the pain of holding down the strings. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll have to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people my age with a similar experience. Maybe we could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!'"
37,"There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It's good that sleep is getting more attention now. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them. We often lose dreams when we wake up early. The last hour or two of sleep, which we often miss, is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, where we dream the most. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM. When people are deprived of REM, they have more intense REM sleep the next night. This suggests dreams are important. When researchers found REM in 1953, many agreed with psychologist Sigmund Freud, who thought dreams were key to understanding our minds. But later research did not fully support this idea. Now, dream studies focus more on the physical side of dreams. Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study. It showed that actors, writers, and directors remember and use their dreams better than other people. Pagel thinks this is because creative people use their dreams more. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don't all people – like teachers, software designers, and politicians – need to think creatively? Dreams, Stickgold says, help us connect things in new and surprising ways. They help us find new patterns and ideas. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They make unexpected connections, which is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you barely remember, can help you think. On those days, words and images come to me so quickly that I can hardly type fast enough. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Text: 'Twenty years ago, Susie Ray moved from London to a small town by the sea in south-west England. In her studio, you see empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leader in the copyist art movement. She can recreate the beauty of a 20th-century impressionist painting or a 16th-century Caravaggio portrait. But she doesn't keep her own work. 'As soon as I finish them, they go,' she says. Susie is very popular. In her 30 years as a copyist artist, she has painted works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts sometimes think they are the originals. While the originals sell for millions, her copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie doesn't usually name her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors love art, but others want to show off. One famous person likes to brag about his 'Van Gogh' painting, which is actually a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. 'Many famous people pretend my copies are originals,' she says. 'That's their choice.' Some collectors keep the original art in a bank and display Susie's copy at home to save on insurance. Susie is honest about her work. She makes her copies look very real and signs her name on the back. Pretending a copy is the real thing is illegal, and she avoids that. People who make fake art often get into trouble. Susie isn't rich and has had hard times, but her life is more stable now. She doesn't want to risk her reputation. Susie wasn't always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She earned very little, but it was good practice for her current work and gave her a love for plants. She had to be very precise in her drawings. She has no regrets but is happy to have found better-paying work. When young artists ask for advice, Susie tells them to learn to draw well and be accurate. She has studied a lot to do her work. She can draw plants, make perfect copies of 15th-century art, and reproduce 20th-century abstract art. Now, she focuses on French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Susie says people think modern art is easy, but it's not. Impressionists painted quickly but carefully, and that mix is hard to do well. It's surprising that Susie doesn't create her own art. Isn't art about self-expression? Could a Susie Ray original be worth more than a copy? She says her work is the result of years of training, and she earns a good living. She has tried her own art, like oil paintings of fishing nets, but they looked like photos. Susie is a perfectionist.'"
39,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything, except maybe being the fastest on it. She was obsessed with sailing since she was a child. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked together as one. When she was back on land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and she quickly wanted to return to the ocean to challenge herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a non-stop, solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and work space for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even the number of kitchen paper rolls she needed. Preparation was key, she said. She proudly showed her supplies of freeze-dried food, a small gas stove, and bags of medical items. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her think about how we take resources and move on. When I visit Ellen’s office, she finishes a conference call and explains why we must act now to save the planet. She says, ""No one is making coal, oil, or gas anymore. They are precious and limited. We need to find ways not to use them up."" At first, her message was to use less, but now she talks about re-using, like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says, ""but I love learning. I couldn’t ignore the current situation. Sailing seemed selfish compared to this. This is about finding how my voice can help. It really matters.""

She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and schools to help young people think about a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It’s what makes me who I am. You are connected to everything around you. You don’t have time to feel lonely. You focus on the record, on practical things, on survival. My new message isn’t as simple as saying, 'I’m going to be the fastest person around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this is more important than anything I’ve done before."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to inspire them to go outside and try new things. Jordan's climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero'. Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

Some experienced Everest climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They agree that a young climber might be physically strong, but they worry if a teenager is emotionally ready. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't focus on that – we have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.'

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father wants him to? Paul says, 'This is not about me trying to be famous because of my son. At first, Jordan talked about doing this later, but we thought: 'Why not now?' We always check with him to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.'

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record challenge. This creates a problem for Jordan. People might say that achieving records is more important than enjoying the adventure, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to share his story. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He needs to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. Paul says, 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.'"
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be pretty sure they’re not listening to classical music. Most of us can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends who Brahms was, they probably won’t know. I have just started a music degree, but the people in my class don’t know more about classical music than others our age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t have any recordings of it. The numbers must be sad for someone who loves classical music. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies. I still find that hard to believe. So, why are people less interested in this type of music that has been around for centuries? Older people blame our love for TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The simple truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know this isn’t true for everyone my age. I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts often, but they are few. Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not a big fan of classical music. I enjoy many styles, but looking at what’s on my computer, my classical music is probably close to that 3% figure. So why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Also, experts say we have trouble paying attention for more than about three minutes; too short for most classical music, but perfect for a pop song. Pop is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. The topics of pop music are more interesting than a long piece of classical music with no words. Classical music is powerful, but not full of the issues that matter to teenagers. The way we listen to music has also changed. In the past, families would make music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music you want online, but the music we hear every day is rarely classical. When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing? One of my teachers says that more people are going to classical concerts now. Maybe, but I bet not many of them are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I mostly see older people in the audience. I don’t know why people like classical concerts more in middle age, but I do know that if you’re a teenager and your parents love something, you’ll probably try to avoid it. Some say that teenagers don’t like classical music because of schools, but many kids are eager to play classical music in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. Classical music interests them when they perform, but it’s not their first choice when they relax. When we want to relax, it’s always pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to herself. Her mother was getting out of the other door and didn’t hear her. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be thrown out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. The horses were well cared for, she noticed. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony, touching its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. Lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" said Bonnie, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. She couldn’t resist riding him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,"" she thought. The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, to her delight. Busy with putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I’m serious because I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, I think we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and the breeze made her cheeks glow. She felt Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he’d jump well."

44,"I jumped out of bed, lifted a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the wall of sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I worked with most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing I could do it. But my grandfather didn’t seem to notice. With one hand still on the curtain, I looked at the half-mile of steaming black water from the wood factory in Milltown. There was fragile ice on both sides, and the dark open water was followed by solid ice downstream. As I took off my pyjamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. A boy I didn’t know. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and reached for my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there – a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from South America. Better than having a famous grandfather is having this chain, which only he, my mom, and I know about. Plus, I have the diary he kept on that journey. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I patted the chain again and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled as I grabbed a banana from the counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hallway and almost bumped into Grandpa as he came out of his room. ‘Can’t you watch where you’re going?’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ As if my wetsuit didn’t make that clear. As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s getting harder. ‘What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. For a moment, his words hurt like he wanted them to. But I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. Mom appeared with a kind smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say he’d always been like that. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero – from the time he showed me photos of him in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. And yet, a part of me still wants to stay loyal to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my trip.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried to the boathouse."
45,"Mum grabbed Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa's, but different from his usual work and not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in the scene; not one she knew, maybe not even a real one, just a fantasy river. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely visible, just a hint of green, drawing the eye into the pale waters towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, for some reason, she was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, hiding her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others figure them out. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? I mean, for him to be so specific. Maybe he’ll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually to say the muse wasn't being kind to him or that he needed to be nice to the muse for a difficult part. He never suggested the muse was her. She always thought he meant a goddess, not a person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"Text: 'When I woke up this morning, I didn't plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad's Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have cut the carpet by itself. I'm not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn't mean to damage the carpet. I didn't wake up thinking, 'Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.' It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it's too late. This happens to me a lot. I'm very unlucky that way. What I was really doing was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It's really cute! Very small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers around the edge, and tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in there: shepherdesses, milkmaids, and old-fashioned ladies selling balloons. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me! But it's a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I have only two corners in my bedroom because it's the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad's; the one at the back is my sister Angela's; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom's; and the one the size of a broom cupboard is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I'll be in my broom cupboard for years. I don't really mind; I like my little bedroom. It's cosy, like a nest. I love the way the roof slopes down, and the window is at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran's cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a little too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... Then I had an idea. If I couldn't cut anything off Gran's cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to 'think outside the box'. And that was exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"The novel ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly take things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn’t want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' view, not a human one, which made filming more difficult. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres to get the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called and asked how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully strange. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act at all. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off because she was sewn into it every morning. The lead actor’s trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t very accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realising there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was quite successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,"Text: 'Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists that aren’t there. I wonder how long it will take before the craziness starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be friends, the questions like, ""Can you get me free tickets to one of your dad’s concerts?"" ""Everything’s going to be fine,"" I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone with this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. I wanted to leave my old life on the road and with tutors. So while the rest of the band is staying here for recording, we’re staying for good. I wanted to come to this school to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so cool. So normal. I walk into the school’s main office. ""Hi, I need my schedule please,"" I tell the school secretary. ""Name?"" She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ""Desert McGraw."" ""Desirée?"" she asks, leaning closer. ""Desert,"" I repeat. The secretary seems confused. ""Oh,"" she says and types ""McGraw"" on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad uses his stage name. ""What grade?"" ""Eleventh."" ""One second, it’s printing,"" the secretary says. Then she gives me the paper. English Literature, first period. Cool, I like that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map last night, so I don’t look lost. When I get to the door, I hear the teacher calling names. ""Aurelio Gonzalez."" ""Here."" She continues while I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes look at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! ""Nice shoes,"" she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. ""Thanks,"" I say. The teacher pauses. ""Desert... McGraw?"" she says slowly. ""Here."" The teacher smiles and says her name is Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she gives us time to talk! All teachers should do this. ""So why’d you move here?"" my new friend asks. I have many choices. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ""We need a change, Desert,"" he said, ""and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed."" Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they pick a studio near the sand? ""My dad had to relocate,"" I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ""What does he do?"" she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out soon, anyway. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. ""He’s an artist,"" I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ""Cool. I’m Becca, by the way."" And she doesn’t seem to care. Excellent.'"
49,"Text: 'Today, the average American teenage girl is expected to do many things. She should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what being an American teenager is like today. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and be average. Being average is not enough anymore. If you don't have big goals, people might think you are lazy. ""People, often adults, forget how much pressure teenagers have these days. We have lots of homework, tests, extra activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life,"" says teenager Kristen Loose. Even though these stresses are normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes about them still exist. People in the media often say teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers might be like this, it is not fair to say all of them are. ""Many people think we spend most of our time watching TV and using our cell phones,"" Loose says. Loose thinks this is mostly wrong. She keeps her cellphone close, but not just for fun. It helps her and others manage their busy lives. Students today are expected to have quick access to information and be reachable all the time, which can look like a phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their work anywhere. Instead of listening to music on the way to school, they might listen to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities now need attention all day, adding to the stress of busy teens. Many teenagers start their day at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. Then, they have to do it all again the next day, often with less than the nine hours of sleep they need. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only about 20 percent of teens get the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are so tired. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says that after all her activities, she has about 18 hours of free time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen rarely spends this time on social media or TV. She uses her energy to volunteer. ""I think people believe teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests,"" Olsen says. Despite this image, Olsen's favorite time of the week is when she volunteers. ""I love helping others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community during the week."" In 20 years, we don't know what people will think about teenagers, but they will still be proving stereotypes wrong and making the world better. There will be another generation of students who are changing the world, even before they finish school.'"
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Over the last few years, this group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. This is a science project with a twist: it’s part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which is why teenagers like it. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal piece from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, given by someone from a nearby state, is used to inflate the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chant, and the balloon rises. Some of them run and track it with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There is quiet and a sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets on the mountainside and look at the clear sky. It’s hard to believe you’re just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I watch a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon expands until it’s almost the size of a house. Then it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day, using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in the middle of nowhere. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who notes they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is becoming familiar with this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side. Then they had to decide whether to drive or walk – it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘These students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to others.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It’s a bit disappointing, but it’s a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountains. And it’s another adventure story to share."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. Her younger brother was very interested in dinosaurs, a phase many children go through, but Chloe hadn't experienced it. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in the field. It amazed her, and she knew she wanted to learn more about it.

I asked Chloe about the support she received because Palaeontology was not a common career choice for young people then. She remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous. Chloe was nervous at first, even though Matt was known to be friendly. She worried he might think she was just a kid bothering him with questions. But he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

I asked Chloe about how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. She admits that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She thinks movies often show palaeontologists as either eccentric geniuses or awkward people who can't relate to others. Films don't show the real work they do.

Chloe explains that her job is varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, working in labs, analyzing fossils, and writing for scientific publications. She also believes in explaining scientific findings to the public. She thinks it's important to clear up misunderstandings about science and likes to talk to young people to get them interested in the natural world.

Chloe worked on the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs. She says the program makers knew what they were doing, and she was there to give advice if needed. She mostly checked that the dinosaurs shown lived in the same time period. The program attracted audiences of all ages because it showed dinosaurs in a new, more realistic way.

Chloe believes dinosaurs fascinate us because they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. They remind us that there is still much to learn about the world, and Palaeontology is like a form of time travel."
52,"Text: ""I’m going to say this once: when you’re traveling by car with your family, even if you’re six years old, you probably know you’re not ‘there yet,’ even if you keep asking ‘Are we there yet?’ And when you do get there, it’s not ‘there’ anymore, it’s ‘here.’ So, if you think you’re ‘there,’ you should ask ‘Are we here yet?’ I’m sure no one wants to be ‘there yet’ more than the parents who hear that question over and over during long car trips. Seriously, what are we kids complaining about? Think about it. Wouldn’t you rather relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles, while the scenery goes by outside the window. In the front seat, there’s mum or dad, who gives out juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio station, and keeps everything running smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying – like my younger brother, Tim, putting his foot on my side of the seat. What? He can’t do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it’s his other foot, then a hand, and soon he’s in my space and we start fighting. The driver and co-pilot separate us as the car swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his own seat. This calms things down for a while. The scenery continues to pass by. Soon, I’m trying to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. But the window isn’t open. Where’s it coming from? My brother is blowing on me. He’s on his side, not touching me, so he’s not breaking any rules. Just breathing? What’s wrong with that? The anger grows. Tim gets yelled at, and there’s more swerving. Then things calm down again – for now. Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. For example, when we ask ‘Are we there yet?’ he often says, ‘Yes. We’re here. Get out of the car.’ ‘But Dad, we’re still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour.’ ‘Oh, maybe we’re not there yet.’ That keeps us quiet for a while. You know you’re finally ‘there’ when the grown-ups get out of the car and move far away from the kids who bothered them for hours. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You’re not there yet."""
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and want to come back. Zuzi explains that they started this business because everyone is busy with phones and gadgets. They wanted to bring people together without screens. The games in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone involved. Later, 'co-operative' games were developed, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. Pandemic is a Eurogame where players work together to solve global problems. It was created by Matt Leacock from North America, inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings. Leacock loved board games since he was a child, even though he often felt disappointed by them. With his uncle's help, he started designing better games. Pandemic was very successful, and its follow-up version included more storytelling, similar to video games. The growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games because gaming has become normal. Ben Hogg, from a games company, says everyone with a smartphone plays games now. Video games used to be social in arcades or with friends at home, but now they are mostly online, making players feel distant. Some people miss playing games with others in person. John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun. In our online world, they offer a way to connect with others in real life, and this trend is growing."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many challenges. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him start playing the guitar. The only radio station he heard at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced him as he grew up. He says he was 12 before he heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. He says, ‘With tennis, I was at a high level, but it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was too much hard work.’ At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. Jamie told his parents that he wanted to make music his career. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. In the end, he became successful behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and joined another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not come. He says, ‘In my own artist career, I’ve often been in the wrong place at the wrong time. But as a writer, I’ve been in the right place at the right time.’ Writing for others is where he found success. He says, ‘I’d like to think I am one of the main writers in the UK that labels send new artists to.’ This helps start their careers. Sometimes he explains to artists that writing with the charts in mind is okay. He asks, ‘Don’t you want 10 million people streaming your music next month?’ He believes they should write songs that are amazing and likely to sell well. It is refreshing to hear someone speak honestly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he just knows he wants to write number one songs and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goal. He says, ‘When I go into the studio, we need to aim for global success and write the best music of next year. It’s not just about being cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs.’"
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online, but people who don't watch online videos of bike stunts might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist.' This means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online.

I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local boys knew him well, and even older people came to say he is 'an absolute legend.' After seeing his skills, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, Tony explained what he planned to do, and I wasn't always sure he could do it. But he did, and when I praised him, he seemed not very interested. Even though he is famous online, Tony says he doesn't like being a celebrity. He finds it hard to talk to fans and prefers doing stunts instead of discussing them.

Tony's fame comes from social media and new camera technology. This technology helps him make a living from what used to be just a hobby. He notices that many people are always looking at screens, but he doesn't complain. He earns well from his videos.

From my experience with top athletes, I know two things are important: energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent and help athletes keep going even when they fail. In risky sports, mental strength is very important. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times but got up and tried again until he succeeded.

Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some say he takes unnecessary risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport. They don't know the technical details or that he gets expert advice to reduce risks. Tony is careful about the risks. He says some people never feel scared, but he does. He plans and prepares a lot before trying a new stunt. He needs to be in the right mindset and fully committed before he jumps. If he is, then he is fine."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found out that high-wire walking was very different. ‘The training was a shock,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then I did an hour of exercises, with another hour after my day practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterward. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ The experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he wrote a book about traveling around Canada in a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a normal touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003, when he had to stop because of a knee injury, he finally started his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. A serious fever left him in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for hospital bills or the journey home. Yet despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, and my team and I are trying to learn more about water birds, especially one called the American black duck. We have just started using an exciting tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we don't know if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We have a lot of information about what they do during the day, but nothing about their night activities because we didn't have the right equipment before. But this new 'scope' will give us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about how to take care of the area where they live. It is very hard work. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn't helped – some nights are mild, but more often it is wet. Oh, and it is so quiet that I have needed lots of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one working day so far because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I like the challenge, especially compared to what the summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we will look at our results together. It will be hard to be stuck inside, but it is important to do this. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But I'm not joking! I spend my workdays eating chocolate! Tasting chocolate is important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from the company I work for. Every week, I get samples, small amounts of chocolate, from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste the products I make. I keep my colleagues happy by giving them samples! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am at our food lab, and other times I'm out of the country buying raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety and lack of routine in this job, although I think the chocolate itself is the best part! People often ask if I get bored of chocolate. I've worked with it for a long time, and I've never felt I didn't want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more in the evening!'"
60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to do different things all the time – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured, or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is planning for the future because you can only travel while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many past students start businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a job for making money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!”'"
61,"Text: 'You may not know her name or her face, but you’ve probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She helps the lead singer by singing in the background. Some people think backing singers aren’t good enough to be lead singers. That’s not true – they have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! ‘What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I’ll be asked to sing,’ she says. ‘It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I’m often surprised by what producers ask for. I was once asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue, I just do the job!’ ‘Excellent musical skills are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There’s often no written music to look at. I’ll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared: I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.’ ‘One of my favorite jobs is doing recordings for songwriters. Less experienced writers don’t always know which musical range is best for the female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to improve it.’"
62,"Julie Deane started with only basic knowledge about fashion, but she has built a successful business with her 'satchels' - a traditional bag used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops around the world and are popular with many celebrities. Before choosing to make satchels, Julie considered different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She thought carefully before making her decision. Not everyone agreed with her choice. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She worked with her family from the beginning, especially her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels came from children's storybooks. Although Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they have been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To get more interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in the satchels grew, as did the speed of production. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied Julie's design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often say there is a positive feeling in her offices – people love working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it is the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her swimming coach thought she could become a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started joining competitions. Vicky thought it looked exciting and decided to try cycling too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was near her school, so she could easily go to training after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, at 28, she stopped competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I got a bit tired of it – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘First, we teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a group.’ The charity uses famous people to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘Some people aren’t sure if having celebrities is always good for a charity. They say celebrities only do it to promote themselves, which hides the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. Her parents were not musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother how to play. The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert and felt happy. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest, she knew more about music than many others. But Ana felt the teacher didn’t listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her feelings. She posted it online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the words. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, came from the other side of Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn’t know the company and didn’t want to be told what to sing. Joss convinced her this wouldn’t happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a great evening. Ana says she likes writing songs about difficult times because there is more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him unhappy. Ana hopes people like her songs, but her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go too, and he finally said yes! A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about what needed to be done. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying. After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide said very few people lived along that coast, and on the first morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great not to worry about time. We always made lunch or dinner together over campfires. When we fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt stress-free! When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many games would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training session, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I did. It took me some time to agree, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it was OK in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I couldn’t spend much time with my friends because of all the training, so that part didn’t change much for me. I got used to my new life in the end, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to fix that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I thought about different jobs and decided to train as a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised to find out how much I enjoyed it. I saw the city I had lived in all my life through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After I finished my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but when I looked into it, I found out that to get a licence as a full-time tour guide, I needed to know a lot more. All Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding isn’t just about knowing historical facts or making sure you don’t lose anyone in the crowds. You need other skills too. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories, and you must react to changing situations, like if a place is closed when you arrive or a route changes. Tourists don’t want to hear about problems; they just want to enjoy a well-organised tour. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might post a negative review online. Like most tour guides, I know these reviews are very important because good reviews attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. For me, the enthusiasm and energy I put into my job means that my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was the first time we did something like this. In the end, we did not need to worry. One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their meal. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants! My favorite part of the day was the evening. We walked with the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we did not have much space. We chose this because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff talked and played games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I am not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy her time there fully. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I definitely will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa and I have a flower shop in the UK. We don’t just sell flowers to people for their friends or homes; many different customers want flowers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in Reception, and sometimes we help with photo sessions for businesses by giving flowers for their advertising pictures. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of what we did. My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I must be crazy, but I love what I do. It’s often colder and darker than I’d like, but that’s normal at that time in the morning, so I don’t mind. The flower market is wonderful, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make choosing difficult. If I was choosing for myself, I’d probably only get pink ones because it’s my favorite color. But I must remember that what I love and what other people want aren’t always the same. It’s not always possible to find the flowers customers want because not all flowers are available all year. I don’t really like arguing about prices with the flower-sellers, but it’s part of the job. Flowers aren’t cheap, so I have to try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I bought. Then we make bunches of flowers and work out how much orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive they are, and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they’d like. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I like thinking about how I can put together the nicest flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things – I wouldn’t want any other job!"
70,"Text: 'My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I felt something was missing – talking about a film with a group of people after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the perfect atmosphere for the film, which was great! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially now we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything’s online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. The website’s been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve visited to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing’s as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience loves the special activities we do with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed.'"
71,"Text: 'Taking photographs was always my favorite thing to do as a child. When I was 15, I wanted to make my hobby more serious, so I decided to do something special. I started a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I began. After a few weeks, I put these photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to other people. I was surprised to find out that some people liked how I saw and photographed things. I also enjoyed taking pictures of many different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be better. I agreed and started focusing on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing—they were taking color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost stopped. But in the end, I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I thought my photography might be good enough to work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.'"
72,"Text: 'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I knew they did camping and sailing and taught skills like public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and you are always learning something new. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, run by adult volunteers called ‘leaders’. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was quite shy then, and all the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. I decided to take the challenge, but only because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, however, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It meant much more to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made some great friendships with the children. Now I am there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to going. Because of what I have learned at the children’s club, I have decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. It wasn’t something I had ever thought about before starting at the club. In fact, I had never thought about my future job, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far, and I have improved my own communication skills while helping others. I have got several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!'"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was so young that I hadn’t thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. After this, I quickly started to love the sport and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored of snowboarding, but I love competing and winning. This makes me try harder. I like not having a fixed plan. Sometimes this works well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That success made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and my studies because there is no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. It helps me deal with not being able to do what I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I wonder if I could become a doctor if I have time for college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I can’t snowboard my whole life."

One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a valuable lesson from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I found it easier than I thought. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they liked them, but I thought they were just being nice. To see if others liked them, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery to take home as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just my mum and me at a market stall! That’s when I knew it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I’ve made a lot of money through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It’s been a lot of fun so far.'"
75,"Text: 'When Janine Stuart was only 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s life. In an interview about her book, Janine said, ‘Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I understand what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, starts at a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. As I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that.’ Janine started her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to try writing. The year before, she entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, they were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia mentions that, even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story face some difficult challenges, and this makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a very long novel, she’s shown that she’s a better writer than some other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ‘At first, I hid when people recognised me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!’'"
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! It all started when my father was asked to be the castle’s manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and keeps them open for people to visit. He was happy because he thought he might not get such a great chance again, but it took some time before the rest of us agreed that Dad should take the job. We were just thinking about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cosy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very friendly in summer because lots of visitors come, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren’t as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all help each other, though, and work on fixing things on the island, which often means lots of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day, back to my old school. I was excited to go on stormy days, when there are big waves – but the ferries don’t run then! And I’ve found out that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I always tell them to hurry up! But we often get the most amazing views, like when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see anything, then within hours it’s bright sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it’s been here for hundreds of years – and it’s still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural home. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different bird species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we came back home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m almost there. On family holidays abroad, I have seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I’d see my 200th species there. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen because I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fun hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. However, my family knew I often got interested in new hobbies and then stopped them, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. And the chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a good player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I didn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know that young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club when I was just 13 years old. After that, I got much better. Even so, people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. As usual, despite the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach’s voice cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. Fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football and to have a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will let them see the professional environment and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team if they’re ready to work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"Text: 'In recent years, a big change in education in the UK and around the world is encouraging new students to start doing research early in their studies. This idea shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries, but it is also a natural way to learn and build skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in jobs because they help you think about the world and do your work. As a student, you add to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat it; you create it. Creating knowledge means asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? How might that be done? What if this were different? How does it work in that context? Why does it matter? These questions are part of what we call research. Research can be very complex and done by experts, but it can also be simple, like asking questions about everyday things. Most students have done some research before, like for school projects or at work. You have asked questions and done some investigation since you first became interested in studying. You have also used research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, or shopping online. In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, finding problems and questions, and thinking critically about information are important learning activities. Some students might find this hard because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and books. It might seem disrespectful to question what is already known, and you might feel you need to be told what is important to learn. But in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australia, questioning knowledge and authorities is important. This might seem difficult, but critical thinking is very important in research. The research of others is useful to students, teachers, and in jobs, but we need to not just repeat what we read. We should think about it, test it, and see if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should not just accept facts and information without thinking critically about them.'"
80,"Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about art in cafés. But living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.

Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains. They found that cities can make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients heal faster when they can see trees. Even a small view of nature can help our brains because it gives us a break from city life.

More people now live in cities than ever before. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a busy city street, our brains have to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and the city layout. This constant attention is tiring because the brain has to decide what to focus on.

Natural places, on the other hand, don't need as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, created by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He said that being in nature helps our brains relax and recover. Unlike city noises, nature doesn't cause stress. Parks like Central Park in New York give people a break from city life and can quickly improve brain function.

People try many things to boost brain power, like energy drinks or changing office designs, but simply walking in nature is very effective. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities keep growing. They remain centers of new ideas because the busy city life encourages social interactions, which lead to creativity. Just like 18th-century London, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are successful creative hubs.

The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people want to leave nature and return to the city."
81,"Text: 'Where should we look for the mind? Many people think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain scans to show this. But I believe the study of the mind should not stop at the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, that objects also play a role in how we think. Archaeology shows that stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have been important in human evolution and the development of the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might also be part of the mind.

It is easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most studies on the mind separate people from the objects around them. This is necessary for brain scans, but it often ignores that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I do not deny the importance of the brain, but I believe the mind is more than just the brain. Human intelligence might extend beyond the body into culture and the material world.

This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also looks at how these processes have changed over time and what they mean for our thinking. This approach gives new insights into what minds are and how they work.

Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The stick and the person become one, showing how minds and objects can be connected. The stick helps the blind person 'see' by touch, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. This example shows that human intelligence can change by using new tools. My approach sees the human mind as always evolving.

It is important to remember that, throughout history, tools like stone tools or the internet have been pathways for humans to understand and interact with the world. For humans, tools are used to satisfy our curiosity. This unique human trait explains why we make things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds change as they interact with the material world.

MET offers a new way to understand how different tools, from stone axes to smartphones, have shaped and changed our minds. Mind-changing technology might sound futuristic, but humans have used it since they first evolved.'"
82,"Text: 'Few inventions have changed the world as much as photography. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became part of American culture at every level. It was used in practical and scientific ways, in industry, in art, and for fun and entertainment. Historians say that photography is perhaps the greatest American contribution to the visual arts. No other art form has been as important in the US. This is a big claim, but it shows how photography has become central to American thinking and art. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century. Why was this new art so popular? First, photography was a mechanical process, which matched the growing interest in technology. This was part of a national mindset that accepted change as normal. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with amazing speed. Second, the camera was the best tool for showing oneself to the public in a country where personal and national identities were always being created and recreated. Third, the camera was important for creating and keeping family memories, even if they were a bit idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the American artists' focus on realism and everyday life. A photograph draws attention to something, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Every picture says, ""Look at this!"" Because a photograph is made by a machine, it has a unique quality: it is a record of events, people, or things. It shows what was in front of the camera, giving it a sense of objectivity. However, since a person takes the photograph, it also has a personal point of view. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, which is why photography has been called a 'universal language.' But the meaning of a photograph is more complex. Few things, whether a person, object, or event, explain themselves. No image is shown to us without some context that affects our understanding, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a magazine or gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and role in its culture: Why did the photographer take it? How did people first see it? The same image might be seen in different places and times, and its meaning can change. The camera's importance to artists was once a secret, but now it is well-known. For many years, starting with American artist Andy Warhol, artists have used photographs in their work in many ways. In short, photography has become an important part of art, not against painting, but as a key part of it, essential to our ideas of representation before the camera was invented.'"
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, described psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, which includes our thoughts and feelings. James was interested in human psychology, which he believed included thoughts, feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. Our understanding is personal and comes from our own experiences, which may or may not be influenced by scientific facts. We often act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on why people behave in certain ways, like feeling unhappy or quitting their jobs. However, problems occur when people see things differently. Formal psychology tries to find the best explanations for these situations. Psychologists help us tell the difference between personal opinions and scientific facts. 

Psychology studies the mind and brain, but psychologists do not fully understand the brain's role in our thoughts and behaviors. They learn more by studying behavior and making guesses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective, but the mind is not directly observable. We can only see behavior and make inferences from it. Psychology is like solving a puzzle, using clues from careful observation and analysis. It aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. Psychology helps us understand our experiences and apply this knowledge to improve lives. It has been useful in teaching, designing safer machines, and helping people express their feelings.

Psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, but scientific study began only about 150 years ago. Early psychologists used introspection, or looking into one's own mind, to answer questions. They wanted to identify mental structures, but introspection has limits. As Sir Francis Galton noted, it only shows a small part of brain activity. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on observing others' behavior rather than their own experiences."
84,"Text: 'In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows the other side of consumer culture, where not all products succeed. Here, you can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were taken off the market because almost nobody wanted them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and Carol Sherry is in charge. She believes each product tells a sad story about the people who designed and marketed it. 

The surprising thing about the museum is that it makes money. You might think companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but they usually don’t. Many business executives visit the museum because they don’t have their own examples of failed products. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who used to work in marketing, wanted to create a library of consumer products, not just failures. Since the 1960s, he collected a sample of every new product he found. He discovered that most products fail, so his collection mostly includes unsuccessful ones.

Today’s culture often focuses on optimism, which might explain why these products failed. People in meetings might not have realized a product was going to fail, or they might have ignored the signs. Marketers sometimes spend more money on a failing product to try to make it sell, instead of figuring out what went wrong. This focus on optimism is also common in the self-help industry, where people believe that imagining success can make it happen. 

Neuroscientist Tali Sharot found that people tend to be overly optimistic about their chances of success. Her research shows that well-balanced people often think they have more control over events than they actually do, unlike those with depression. Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen studied whether positive thinking helps people achieve their goals. Her research found that thinking too much about success can actually reduce motivation. For example, people who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck says our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a 'fixed theory' mindset think ability is natural and unchangeable, so they find failure very upsetting. For example, a sports star who believes he is a 'natural' might not practice enough and fail. People with an 'incremental theory' mindset believe ability can grow with effort and see failure as a chance to improve. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger after being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset can lead to a happier life, whether or not it leads to success.'"
85,"Text: 'Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. On the other hand, people who invest money in sports wonder why home advantage matters if players are paid well. Shouldn't players feel comfortable anywhere if they earn enough?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their passion and support. Fans often think that when they cheer loudly, it helps their team score. But they forget the times when cheering didn't lead to a goal.

However, there is one thing that seems true. Home fans often try to influence the referee. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This matches what happens in real games. Referees try to avoid making decisions that would upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home football teams in England won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort. Stadiums are also more similar now. Despite these changes, home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, while basketball and football require teamwork.

Another reason for home advantage might be related to players' testosterone levels. Studies found that players had higher testosterone before home games. This might be a natural urge to defend their home ground. In the Rugby World Cup, some home teams won against stronger opponents by using determination and aggression, showing signs of home advantage. As one referee said, 'It’s the law of the jungle out there.''"
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said the golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is important to athletes and their coaches. The saying is interesting because its meaning is not clear. Player didn’t really mean lucky; he meant, ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ But how much better can you get with practice? This question is part of the nature-nurture debate: is talent something you are born with, or can you develop it through practice? 

Many people believe practice is more important than natural talent. This idea is supported by psychologist Anders Ericsson, who said that you can become an expert in any field with 10,000 hours of practice. This theory became popular through books like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers"" and others that say practice is the key to success. They suggest that 10,000 hours of practice is enough to make anyone an expert. 

However, in his book, Epstein argues that this is not always true. He points out that studies often focus only on successful people, which can be misleading. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others don’t, looking at both natural talent and the environment, support, and determination. His research takes him around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to Alaska. In Alaska, he learns that the husky dogs’ drive in sled races might be partly genetic, suggesting that determination might also have a genetic component.

Epstein talks about the difference between ‘hardware’ (nature) and ‘software’ (nurture) and says that both are important for elite athletes. He does not ignore the importance of training or environment. For example, he suggests that if Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a good basketball player instead of the fastest runner. But Epstein also shows that sometimes genes are very important. He also discusses race and gender, asking why men and women compete separately if only practice matters. Sometimes the simplest questions are the most important."""
87,"Text: 'A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today’s children so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that these children spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers, and have lost touch with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. She believes this is the main problem. This idea matches other discussions about children today. A follow-up study talked to children to understand their unhappiness better. It found that many children would be happier if they could play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, when they spent long summer days exploring, swimming, or building dens. They think this was healthier than the way children live now. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have made life more protective for their children, worrying about risks. Griffiths’ book has strong arguments. She talks about the fear of danger that keeps kids at home and how it benefits the toy and gadget industry, which sells things to keep children entertained indoors. She also discusses trends like giving medicine to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. It’s unclear how common these rules are, but Griffiths shares her strong feelings about them. She also talks about childhood freedoms and rules, from fairy tales to school rules. Her arguments are interesting, but sometimes she goes too far. She ignores important counter-arguments and at one point compares modern treatment of children to racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths is very romantic about children. She mostly sees them in a positive way, which might not match real-life experiences with lively young children. She says, ‘children are the musicians of thought,’ but this might not be true for all kids. The main idea of the book is that children should have freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths thinks kids need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. But she doesn’t explain how to ensure these accidents are ‘the right size.’ Also, not all children might want the adventurous life Griffiths describes. What about the quiet and cautious children? Maybe the real mistake is forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside.'"
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my education. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the value of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Those that have more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems, not just follow instructions or do routine calculations. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate problems, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play'. He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring for them, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and through play, they learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit. If you cannot quit, it is not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue playing. This makes play very democratic. School has become harder: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, experts warning about dangers, less cohesive neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school; they need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must change the trend of the last fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to contact potential employers directly. This is similar to standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with more access, there is also a higher chance of making mistakes.

For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts that the jobseeker thought could help him get a job. But the executive was not happy with this request. She did not want to share her contacts with a stranger and sent a harsh rejection note, which became very popular online. Many people who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone. However, this incident might help young people think more carefully about using social media for professional purposes. It shows that social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly.

There is an irony here because social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress others and try new things. It was often based on fantasy. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. By choosing certain pictures or songs for your Facebook page, you could become a different person. But when using social media for professional networking, this experience can be a problem. Some young people do not see the difference. We first became popular online by being bold, which might be why some still think this is a good idea. Just because many people liked your Facebook posts, it does not mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you are worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers does not work in the job world. We must meet employers' standards to succeed.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too familiar and seem arrogant. This makes older generations think of us as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, many young people are desperate to find jobs, which is why they turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt their chances, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable workers.

So, how should you contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This approach gives you a better chance of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal emails and keep a humble tone to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it needs careful handling to avoid closing doors."
90,"Text: 'Anyone who says they can predict the future of newspapers is either lying or foolish. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA says that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of US citizens, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people predict that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist said that books and theatre were finished and that newspapers would become the most important form of social life. But theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has done well in the TV age, and cinema has stayed popular despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales up 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened because it became possible and affordable to produce news for many people in the mid-19th century, thanks to the steam press, railway, and telegraph. Also important was the idea that everything is always changing and we need regular updates, which was not common in medieval times. Now, we expect change. To medieval people, the only certainties were the seasons and disasters like famine, flood, or disease, which they couldn't predict. Life was seen as cyclical, with important truths repeating. Journalism as a full-time job only started in the 19th century. Even then, there was no clear reason why people needed news regularly. Regular newspaper publication can be a burden. Online news readers can check news whenever they want. Search engines and algorithms let us personalize news to our interests. When big stories happen, internet news can update minute-by-minute. Mistakes can be corrected quickly. There are no space limits, so stories can be detailed, and documents can be accessed in full. This is very different from newspapers. However, online news often focuses on being first, getting reader comments, and creating excitement, which can add to confusion. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, where truth mixed with rumors. In some ways, we are returning to that. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction. Or, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic world, newspapers might find that they can guide us to understanding.'"
91,"Text: 'If humans were truly comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, just like many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This is a basic part of who we are, even if we don't often think about it. It's why we have changed the night by adding light everywhere. This change, called light pollution, has effects that scientists are just starting to understand. Light pollution happens because of poor lighting design, which lets artificial light shine into the sky instead of focusing it on the ground. This extra light changes the natural darkness of night, affecting many living things, including us. It can disturb migration, reproduction, and feeding. In the past, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's largest city. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no public gaslights in the streets yet. From a few miles away, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but it is not. Many animals are active at night. Light is a strong force and attracts many species. For example, birds can be drawn to bright lights and fly around them until they are exhausted. Birds migrating at night can crash into tall, brightly lit buildings. Some birds sing at strange times because of artificial light. People used to think light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need a clear night sky. Most of us don't need a perfect view of the stars for our work, but we do need darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can cause health problems. The regular cycle of day and night is important for our well-being. Changing these rhythms is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are affected by light pollution just like animals near bright lights. We have lost touch with our natural and cultural heritage – the stars and the natural day-night cycle. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, which we can best understand by looking at the night sky with the Milky Way above us.'"
92,"The founder of a big international company recently said that his company will stop keeping track of employees' paid holiday time. This idea was inspired by an internet company with a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in many newspapers. Some people think this announcement is just a way to make the company look good, but is the idea practical?

The internet company and the big international company are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the big company has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work better. 

The founder of the big company said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team are up to date and their absence won't harm the business or their careers. But is it possible to be that sure? Even if you prepare before a holiday, there is always work waiting when you return. This might make employees feel guilty about taking time off, leading to stress and lower productivity.

There could also be pressure from colleagues about who takes time off and for how long. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave. If employees don't feel safe taking leave, they might not take it at all, or they might stick to their legal rights, making the policy useless.

Modern technology blurs the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can't track work hours, why should it track time off? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could become work hours. Employees might feel watched all the time, leading to stress.

Employment laws exist to ensure workers get enough rest for their health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like better morale and creativity, can happen without affecting worker well-being. So, I am not sure if ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is really the goal or the likely result of this policy."
93,"Text: 'Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in the same field check a scientific research paper. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. This process is supposed to stop flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often mention it to assure the media and the public. Reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trust in published research? The answer is both yes and no. Looking into these issues shows a lot about the current state of scientific publishing, which is changing. I am not ready to give up on journal-based peer review. I still think all papers should be checked before they are formally published, but I feel changes happening. The growing use of preprints (drafts of papers posted online without peer review) is an important part of this change. Preprints help share new results quickly so they can be read, critiqued, and built upon. Publishing in journals has become more about fame and career growth, which affects the motivations of authors and reviewers. Competition for spots in top journals pushes scientists to do their best work, but it also encourages cutting corners. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good. For top journals, this can depend on how newsworthy a paper is, not just its scientific quality. These problems are known, but few people want to change the system. However, as biologist Ron Vale recently argued in a preprint, preprints might be a way to solve these issues because they don't require a big change from the norm. Preprint archives have existed for twenty years, but they are not used everywhere. This slow adoption is partly because scientists are cautious and because many think journals won't accept papers that have been posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review will lead to 'junk science,' but this hasn't happened yet. Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but authors know they will be critiqued by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, says: ‘My paper was a critique of another paper, which is hard to do in traditional journals. With anonymous peer review, the original authors might block a critical paper, or they might not be chosen as reviewers and could complain about misrepresentation. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and we could consider their points. All comments are public, so readers can judge the quality of the arguments. Rejection by journals is less of a problem because the preprint and comments are still available, so our work is not wasted.’ Preprint archives allow global scientific discussions that used to be private. They can also be a place for negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals focused on new discoveries. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing their effectiveness. By using the web's openness and the collaborative spirit in science, preprints can help focus on the work itself, not just where it is published.'"
94,"Text: 'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is like ‘a painting in words’. Their answers rarely satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist, and another from the point of view of the object itself, called ‘Poem.’ Here’s what one student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. The item? An oxygen mask – a surprising choice that helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to fun and useful discussion. When I was in school, poetry didn’t make much sense to me. I saw every poem as a confusing puzzle that blocked true understanding and feeling. After school, poetry becomes something most people care about less and less. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It almost dares you to read it, and often you feel disappointed because it seems plain or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we hope to find in poems? Aren’t poems places for deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or strong opinions, we read online articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings please our eyes, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. However, one thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life – unlike reading sentence by sentence – is full of it. But these ideas still don’t tell us what a poem really is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it leads to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of literary art using the beauty and rhythm of language.’ This is fine for English professors, but it hides the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes say poems are like wild animals – untameable, unpredictable – or like machines – carefully made and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t always work. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It can help us think differently and see common things in a new way. The poem as a mental object is not hard to imagine, especially if we think about how song lyrics can get stuck in our heads. The mix of words and melody is powerful, like schoolyard rhymes such as ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, looking right at you: A poem can hit home like nothing else, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is made by writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, but it never really becomes what they usually are – something made to be sold. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry books, but few expect a book to pay for its printing costs. A poem shows itself not as something for sale, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special place – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment.'"
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been better to spend it on something useful for the house. Still, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I found made me happy because it felt like connecting to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much.

One dull February afternoon, I had a couple of hours free and a place in mind to search. But it was raining, so I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming tools. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, detailed loop. I stopped and stared, then remembered to breathe. It looked like the Great Torc, a famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. A torc is a beautiful necklace of gold and silver, with a gold ring at each end, just like the one I found.

I took it to the car and kept looking at it on the drive home. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had in ages. ‘Marion!’ I called, ‘I've got something for you.’ She came in, stopped, and asked, ‘What is it?’ I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I was anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there.

The law says you must report such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was checked and later sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People ask me, ‘Now that you've found something amazing, will you stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing. There's always the chance of a bigger fish tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy travel plans, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rain and lazy mornings in Italian beds? Better sleep is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, I could sleep deeply and have vivid dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes easier. But I think travel sleep is different because it is part of the travel experience. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. When we sleep, we process all this new information. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with different places. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local habits is harder than changing time zones. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I truly belong there. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, everyone slowly stopped talking and went to rest on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American custom of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds in my sleep. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said to her customer politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking unhappy. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little hat will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change the woman's mind. Smiling, she agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. Mia thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and Mia was excited to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen's friend, Tattie, whom they knew nothing about. When Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie, Mia's husband, Jeff, had said, ""Tattie? What sort of name is that?"" Mia replied, ""It's short for Tatiana. I think it’s nice."" Jeff thought it sounded too fancy. He didn't like anything showy and always spoke his mind. He wouldn't have hesitated to tell the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said a trash can lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite."" An hour later, Mia closed her shop and went home. Her commute was only forty seconds because her shop was in a converted barn next to their house. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia decided to turn the barn into a space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends that there was a demand for hats for special occasions. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her create a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham. In a relaxed and friendly place, they could try on many hats to find the right one. Mia encouraged customers to bring their outfits to make sure everything matched. She recently started selling handbags and costume jewelry too."
98,"Text: 'Lawrence Okoye has moved from London to Atlanta, USA, for a new part of his sports journey. He is confident but surprised by how far he has come—from competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major American football team. Lawrence has never played American football before, but he might be chosen for one of the top teams. In Atlanta, he is learning about his new position in the sport. It seems unbelievable that a 21-year-old from London could be picked for a big American team, but Lawrence is used to surprising people. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on discus instead. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training to prepare for the world championships. He says, ‘American football was in the back of my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. I thought about it in school, but it seemed crazy then.’ After arriving in America, he read about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, he thought he might be good enough to try out. ‘Pretty much,’ he says. ‘I went on the site and applied.’ Was he nervous about competing with experienced players? ‘No,’ he says. ‘I don’t get nervous for many things.’ Lawrence is confident in his abilities. His performance in tests and drills made him stand out as the most impressive player. ‘I was very happy to hear that,’ he says. But he knows he has a lot to learn. How can someone with no experience make it into an NFL team? ‘Coaches say I have the right skills. It’s about how hard I work,’ he replies. Is he worried about being selected? ‘I’m not. There’s no pressure on me. People say I’ll be picked, but I’m not too worried.’ This calm attitude might come from his Olympic experience, where he finished last in the discus final. He has moved on from that and is proud he made it to the final. ‘That was an amazing day,’ he says. ‘The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s sport. I can return to it.’ After the Olympics, some thought the experience affected him. Lawrence doesn’t comment on that. An NFL player earns at least $400,000 a year, so the money is a big reason to try. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Should he focus on one sport? ‘I understand why people say that,’ he responds. ‘I’m trying to achieve a dream I had as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work out, I can go back to discus, which I love. Every decision I’ve made has been thought through.’'"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, it had not yet started snowing in Siberia. I could see no sign of human life, and the view stretched out with mountains, streams, and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to a remote area to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with the help of a dictionary, I explained that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it these days. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and said one word, ""Holodna"" (cold), pointing outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I was not sure they would be good enough, especially my large postman’s over-trousers, which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me sat Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays to chase adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to do something more exciting than teaching: to cycle around the world. Ever since that first ride we took together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times he thought that the ride, or the road, would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could deal with each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the people who said he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"Text: 'In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns to race through a series of pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to see what it feels like to take part. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first said I was in good health, and the second said I would empty all my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I would need to stay oriented. ‘The horizon is your best friend,’ I was told, ‘the pilot will explain which way to look.’ I was also asked to promise that when flying upside down, I would ‘completely relax. Try and enjoy the view.’ Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were moving down the runway, my legs were up in front of me, feet trying not to touch the important steering pedals, hands trying not to touch any of the many important switches, my mind was made up. Ignoring all instructions, I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the difficult part of high-speed acrobatic flying. To survive without passing out, you have to stay calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. None of this was comforting as we started going down the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway. We were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the world’s fastest acrobatic planes, ready to go. The plane took off and two seconds later we turned sharply to the right. It was a quick, strong move and I felt the air push out of my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed everything, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned sharply left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, aiming for the small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour but my moment of excitement was taken by a sharp right turn. We hadn’t even done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, my hand shaking so much the plane shook too… it’s that responsive. Then Dario said something. I said, ‘Can you repeat that?’ But instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Yup.’ ‘Have you had enough?’ ‘No,’ I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane up and over, turning a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was a bit much. At the top of the loop, as we were flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ‘Relax, relax, look up.’ Then I looked up and saw some fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been ‘soft’ compared to what the pilots endure when they race. To show this, Dario got out some sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily ate. I didn’t eat for hours and that night I dreamed of doing the loop the loop over and over again.'"
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you’ve ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. He says his perfect temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about surviving in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very hard. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. He had to swim in very cold water and deal with frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now, he is back in the Arctic, getting ready for a new expedition that he says is even more challenging. Explorers are confident and determined people. They need to be. This time, there is much more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the ice in the polar region. This is a job he was trained for. When he was a child, Pen was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tougher by sending him out into the Scottish mountains in blizzards with as few clothes as possible. His father gave him a love for frozen adventures, and Pen had unusual physical strength. Pen is married to Mary, who loves horses and the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he’s at home: ‘He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic.’ For fun, she once raced against him in a famous mountain event where riders on horseback compete against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he admits. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in the way I said goodbye. I told my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He took it seriously, asking his mum how she was all the time, but it was too much for him. It was well-meaning, but unfair.’ For similar reasons, he plans to have very little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending these last days before leaving preparing his equipment carefully. ‘Out on the ice, you can’t fix things easily or do anything that isn’t simple,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will have a team of six flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for someone like him, says Pen, and he is also thinking about something else. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done far less training than I’m comfortable with.’ Why? ‘Organisational things always seem more urgent. So I’m almost afraid of what I’m going to ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission connects exploration with the search for knowledge that inspired past explorers. ‘Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,’ he admits, ‘and not very useful to anyone outside the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re trying to involve as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which are usually strange and not needed in society, have become very important. Suddenly, we’re useful again.’"
103,"Text: I had a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. These activities were great, but I missed having a big competition. I wanted to stay fit in case I wanted to try for the Olympics again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn't ready to train every day. I talked to some rowing friends about the race, but they weren't interested. I knew if I joined the race, I would want to win. Would Ben help me win? Probably not. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat, making the race possible. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete. It's nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I could talk about something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but it was straightforward. I trained all day nearly every day, but the program was set, with doctors and dieticians. I worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I was afraid it would look like I just wanted to be on TV. My worries went away during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and a year on a deserted island. But he couldn't row. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to show Ben the big improvements he needed. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in the far north of Finland. At 26, I was feeling restless. I was dreaming of cold and empty Arctic landscapes, maybe because of the noise and crowded life in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to let me work as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow. These rides can last from an hour to five days. They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place – the 'wilderness farm’, which they said was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I look at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies. I am supposed to learn their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out of the window instead. People say that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, bringing flowers and leaves. But I think I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south and the rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forests with thin trees covered in snow, stopping sometimes to let reindeer pass. I arrive at the farm after dark and am given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to start right away?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the barking, which becomes very loud by the time I reach the dogsheds. Three people are running back and forth, getting the huskies ready and attaching them to sleds. The dogs are very excited, pulling hard on the ropes because they want to go. I can barely hear to introduce myself, and the others are too busy to talk much. I stand on the side and pet one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light. November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but first, I am asked what I can do for the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I don’t know. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never used an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and giving water to the dogs become hard in the cold. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is full of instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around by very excited huskies. But I feel proud. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,"On that day, when Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would allow her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says the achievement never really felt real to her. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal, but at the time, it just felt like what she was meant to do. Her team had a motto: no limits.

During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist, was also there. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep up the fast pace, fearing she might drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, but he understood why someone might think it was risky. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast and still sprinted the last part in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run quicker than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn’t expect anyone to beat that time soon, but Radcliffe thought she could do it again next year. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen.

After the race, people wondered how Radcliffe, with her awkward running style, beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her for weeks, helping her manage the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle pain like her. She would push me to work so deeply into her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours to her training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no time for a break; she was ready for a two-hour session. Hartmann said, ‘Paula would get every last bit of effort from you. That's what made her so good.’ During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that other athletes felt neglected.

Can Radcliffe explain why no one has beaten her record? ‘Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people race each other more than themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘I always pushed myself, even when I was winning. I never relaxed; I always kept pushing hard.’ Radcliffe didn’t know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She never ran as fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running."
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, came out, I didn't know how people would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I believed our show was a new and exciting part of that, but I was still worried. Would people like a cooking show that included not just techniques, but also history, memories, and science? I watched the first episode feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my restaurant experiences. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often a real one, with travel and meeting new people. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest book, where you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best golden pasta. These people have spent years trying to reach their own idea of perfection. Perfection is different for everyone. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But after long meetings, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of what is perfect, based on their feelings, memories, and surroundings. I knew from the start that I wouldn't say the recipes were the 'best'. But I thought that by using my skills and talking to food experts, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV series let me explore foods, people, and places I had never seen before, and I was excited about that. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. Some of my adventures included visiting a factory that processed the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that was not good enough to film. To perfect each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow, using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down trying to make a Neapolitan-style pizza.'"
107,"Text: 'We were still hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field. It stopped suddenly. John got out and opened the front of the van to look at the engine. He stood there for a long time, looking like he knew what he was doing. But then he said, ‘Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,’ and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field was big, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I said, agreeing with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John walk away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay down next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’ So I told them about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and a fight over a worm. ‘That’s silly, no one understands bird language,’ Bea said. My eyes hurt. ‘I do.’ But my voice didn’t sound sure. ‘Liar.’ I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ‘Mum…?’ But she was asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her through the windows. We followed John into a café near the road, not far from where our van was parked. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘It might be expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ‘It’s like syrup in there,’ she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. ‘It’s amazing it got us this far,’ he said when it got dark. Mum put blankets on the ground for us to sleep in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ‘I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,’ John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John driving it. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we’d get home since our van needed to be pulled everywhere. I thought it might be easier to take a boat straight to London. Then I fell asleep.'"
108,"Lucy was at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists who were playing at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like Lucy. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city. Lucy didn't hear her name clearly because of the noise, but it was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy. They spoke English well enough to talk about the music they were playing, where they had traveled recently, and where they were going next. 

‘I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,’ Lucy told them. It sounded impressive. But Lucy didn't really want to go to the Tanglewood festival. She didn't want to do many of the things that filled her time: the concerts and competitions that took her around the world. She missed so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she made it. There was a party. Lucy’s dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to congratulate her, and her little brother Gus imagined himself at the same festival one day. Grace Chang, her teacher, took Lucy out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. The thing was, Lucy hadn't even applied. Her mother had filled out the form and sent in the CD. ‘I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,’ her mom had said. Lucy thought it was more like her mom didn't want to give her the chance to say no. At that time, Lucy thought that causing trouble was the worst thing a person could do, and she didn't even think about trying to get out of it.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward as if he had misheard her. ‘Tanglewood?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘How old are you?’ ‘Fifteen.’ He exchanged a glance with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ‘Wow.’ Lucy hadn’t meant to brag. It was hard to know the difference between sharing her achievements to fit in and showing off. ‘It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're going to try...’ ‘Excuse me,’ Liesel/Louisa said, looking across the room as if she saw someone she had to talk to. The guy from Tokyo stayed. ‘Have you ever been to Japan?’ He had long, shaggy hair, like many guy musicians, to show they were music nerds but also rebels. ‘Once. When I was, like, eight.’ He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared at her side. ‘Lucy, let me introduce you to someone.’ He took her arm and pulled her away from the conversation. ‘And don't get too friendly with the competition.’ ‘They're not the competition.’ ‘Everyone is the competition.’ Her grandfather took her around the room and made her talk to everyone he thought was important. Lucy smiled and nodded a lot, hearing about half of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after they left the party, her grandfather turned to her. ‘You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’ She did like that part. Being somebody. Even if it meant some people were jealous or thought she was too young to get the kind of attention she did. Being a concert pianist didn't win her any special respect from the kids she’d been at school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know and wouldn't care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro well. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. He’s hard to argue with, so I decided to see what experts say – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a good sense of who they are, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is a big part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just use media for things like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do – they live in it. It’s not good or bad – it’s how you use it that matters.’ How does our social networking compare with what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like hanging out at the youth club, as today’s parents did when they were younger, to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. It helps teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and get along with their peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you find that self-identity: you can post about your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see that other people have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He says that using social media can help if you’re shy: ‘Talking online can be easier than face-to-face, and you can practice social skills in a less scary environment.’ Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help if you’re quiet and have a special interest because they let you connect with others who like the same things. ‘If you’re one of only three people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people who like the same thing, you can still be popular, just in a different way,’ he says. Pauline White, a digital education expert, told me something interesting: ‘It’s people your age who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people, and create their own content who are really using the power of social networks.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about things that interest them. Photo-sharing sites, she says, are changing creativity. Keen photographers can connect, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interest. ‘This all helps with getting jobs and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness – and you need to understand how it works to create customers. For example, if you make a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they’re all potential customers. If you link all those networks, there’s your customer base.’ Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and share it. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill and important for being employable in a digital age.’"""
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they probably don't think of a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province. But my parents wanted something different for our summer vacation this year. My dad planned what many teenagers might think is a nightmare: a big family trip. ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" my parents said before the vacation, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There's probably a reason why!"" In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With just enough space left for us in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our big home for smaller places to stay over the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into. We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under very dark, starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway in a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way! The next day, we got up early and started driving again. I noticed a pattern. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to feel the same, but each adventure was different. We walked on the Great Sand Dunes and went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. As we climbed to our next stop, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of old and new. We got used to traffic from road construction. We laughed when we saw the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" where traffic stops to let a bear cross, were common, and our close encounter with a bear and a worried park ranger gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life at home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its problems, didn't ruin our excitement. It was a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service, but it had the most amazing views. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to a faraway place to find something special. It was both happy and sad to be home again, but at least I didn't fight with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our trip to look through and remember. For me, the best memories were the unplanned and spontaneous moments.'"
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay because it was her final year. Amy was happy because she got the best room at the college, with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still watch over Amy, even if she didn’t like it. So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. Rose only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose’s parents were not very excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to know her granddaughter again. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Rose was ten years old when she last saw her grandmother, but her memories were happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked bringing people together. Rose expected dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady and seemed to go to more social events than the Queen of England. Dahlia and Rose talked before the move. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. But Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, or go out without asking permission every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen phone with a video camera for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed it would be about trust. Her grandmother would trust her to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were problems, they would talk about it. Rose was never a wild child. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and start her life again. It was her fourth school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this was the last time because she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. She thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed difficult. When she was 13, she decided to try writing a novel. Now, that novel is about to be published. Charlotte told her old teacher, who was surprised because she thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn’t understand why she should wait if she could do it now.

I met Charlotte in the office of her publishers. Even though I knew she was 15, I was surprised to see a teenager there. Her book is impressive: the story is strong and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, shows it was written by a teenager. A public relations person was with us in case Charlotte needed help, but she didn’t. Charlotte is confident and smart, but also calm. She knows she is young and says, ‘I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don’t have many life lessons to share,’ she laughs. ‘I don’t think my age limits my understanding, but I’m not very wise either. I wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.’

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are shown in books. She says there are three types: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows little about the world, and the awkward teenager who isn’t socially skilled. She found these types annoying. ‘What if you’re basically fine? There aren’t many stories about characters who are okay. Some writers make it seem like teenagers can’t know who they are because they lack experience, and this can hurt their confidence.’

Charlotte loves reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ‘These books explore deep ideas about psychology and life. I wondered if I needed to do the same to write a good book and if I could do it.’ She does like a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ‘It says if the reader can guess what happens next, the suspense is gone.’

Some might think Charlotte’s parents, who are journalists, helped her get published. Her father knew someone in publishing who read her book first. She knows she was lucky because getting a first novel read is hard, no matter the author’s age. ‘Every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, it’s up to your talent,’ Charlotte says."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping, wanted to show he knew what he was doing. He went first, skiing down the slope towards the jump. He went fast and flew into the air, but something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle skiing. On past skiing holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it, and I was afraid of being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. It had a big indoor area near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes – not a real introduction to what we’d face on the slopes. After practising indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, inexperienced ski jumpers would just go down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part behind the jump before the slope goes down again. Land in the right zone and you keep moving, which is less painful. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to make my body go fast towards the jump. My legs would almost stop as I got close, so I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being indoors, but bouncing was fun. Some exercises copied ski-jumping moves, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – I only remembered the moment before take-off, then found myself in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more problems before I finally landed right. Gareth was as happy as I was, and I felt proud. But that didn’t last long. On the last run of the day, I kept my speed, jumped, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope, not on my feet anymore."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you hold tightly to the safety bar. The ride stops for a moment, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs up. There is a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You move quickly forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Everything is a blur, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose to be here, like millions of others who visit theme parks every year.

Amusement parks are a big business, with exciting rides that attract many people. To create these thrilling experiences, there are large teams of engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it is a real and challenging career. Designers must create rides that are both fun and safe, while also adding new features to keep visitors interested.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most of the techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rides were more extreme, but now designers must work with the track designs from specialist manufacturers.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, an engineering expert, explained that it's about making people feel like they are being thrown around but still safe. The best rides tell a story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and use new features like the tallest ride or the most twists to create a smooth experience.

Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trying different things are important. Jeff Hornick, a theme park development director, agreed that designers need to understand what passengers want and test the rides themselves. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said that while new technology is exciting, the physical rollercoaster experience will still be the most important part for many years."
115,"Text: 'At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. I wonder why she does both activities with her busy schedule. ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day long,’ she says. As a choreographer, she teaches and enjoys working with young students. ‘A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re open to taking risks. They want success, but they don’t yet know their strengths and weaknesses. This means they accept even harsh criticism. They might still challenge what I say sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’ When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There may be music I don’t like, but I still make sure I create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, that can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. I can’t choose a new piece of music. I’d like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces – it’d help lift the mood when rehearsals are tough. But now I’m always working on big productions – the music is already written and can’t be changed.’ Miranda doesn’t want to work with just one institution. ‘I think it’s important to meet new people. But I have to remember that all the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to be ready to change the way I work each time I go somewhere new, rather than do the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’ We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries in the past which were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really tries to show viewers what life is like inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections and I smiled when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but just can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s painful to watch but not made up for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication in ballet is underestimated by the public.’ I want to know what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together. Perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and allows you to get away with a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great but something about the costumes or props distracts. And that’s disappointing.’ Miranda has done many different works, so I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to put a label on you and I don’t understand that. There’s a tendency to encourage expertise in a narrow area, too. I don’t agree with that, though the time may come when I’m happy to be known for doing one thing. For now, I just want to widen my horizons.’'"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home on your sofa when there’s so much to experience outside? That conversation gave me the idea for my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend of mine was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.'"

My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I decided a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although still puzzled, he showed me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained a support boat would go with us all the time, and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool, and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I’d hoped. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was happy when I finally managed it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and pleasure at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.'"

I work with amazing people, I have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. This makes it a great job for a young person like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school in another country, away from my family, so I always flew alone when school started and ended. Feeling lonely, I would ask the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers, and some of them let me. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for something new. There were many young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often well-qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say – more than just saying I loved to travel, because everyone would say that. Instead, I talked about my strengths and past work experience – and I got the job! I would recommend this job to anyone because there are many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which doesn’t happen often, I know the flight will soon be over and I will probably never see them again!'"

Almost all the children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do have children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can phone home after lunch. Then when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days, and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. We do get parents who are on the phone all the time, asking how their child is doing, which is not necessary. Often their son or daughter will be busy, playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back another time. We often get a certain type of child coming, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand the reason why.'"

Doing the show with only British actors was difficult. In the UK, there are more rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they’ve just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it’s been full every night. Everyone wants to hear the songs that were first popular in America. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. ‘It’s great that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have normal school lessons each day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre has special deals on tickets for schools. They loved it and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I didn’t know. Jamie helped me, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s ability and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! While the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they found it quite easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show is in London for another year, and it is well worth seeing.'"
