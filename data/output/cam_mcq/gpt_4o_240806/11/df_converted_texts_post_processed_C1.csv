1,C2,"Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins—telling everyone online where you are. The message was clear: you might think you're just saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you're also letting everyone know you're not at home, including people you might not want to meet. This highlighted the growing concern that sharing everything online might have negative sides. The internet offers many chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising things like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the online world, sharing confessions, photos, and stories. But soon, we realize it's a crowded and risky place, and we can feel lost. Is this depressing? Maybe, but don't lose hope. This future has a guide, created by early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame—long before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have already experienced what many of us are now facing. Before we forget their stories, it's worth learning from them. As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" as it was called then, mostly used by students and scientists. The web was invented at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with words, photos, and art. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people were drawn to his bold use of this new medium. Hall's rule was simple: if you crossed his path, you might end up on his site; no topic was off-limits. While it was the work of an exhibitionist, there was also a beauty to his project that some might call art. One day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced with a video titled ""Dark Night."" He shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains. Sharing online is great, but if you expect it to make people like you, you'll be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog to all the vice presidents, including those she had mocked, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect"": the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web isn't a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected. Ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. Armstrong's story ended well. Though she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Now, she's a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once an example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life carefully. Armstrong learned an important lesson: just because we can say anything online doesn't mean we should."
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't have all the answers about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to publicly criticize the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch.
At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film talked about how new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film discussed discoveries like the idea that water molecules can be affected by thoughts. I had heard before that a Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. However, the film only showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy, and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Many people find this kind of evidence convincing because it is simple and clear. But scientists usually respond with skepticism, saying, ""Give me a break."" They want solid proof that the effect is real, and pretty photos of crystals are not enough.
The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. Consider this: water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere, linked to a force driving the expansion of the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research in labs and observatories worldwide. Discoveries now show that the universe is indeed stranger than we imagined. Astronomers have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy.""
Beyond the film, other discoveries are equally amazing. Neuroscientists found that our conscious perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this delay out. Anthropologists believe they have found where modern humans originated and how they spread across the world. Some theorists even suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's fundamental design.
Science is far from complete. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some of the world's top theoretical physicists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe with one equation. Despite these theories, many people think the universe can be summed up in one word: incredible."
3,C2,"'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. These two activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and vice versa. These two types of writing might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. After starting my career with two short novels in 1975, I began writing short stories from 1984 to 1985. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers seemed to enjoy this new side of me. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can be endless). It’s not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That’s it. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I’ll make it through. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small things – an idea, a word, an image. It’s often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn’t work, you just accept that not all stories can be great. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t write masterpieces every time. This is comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like soft shadows I’ve left in the world, faint footprints. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,C2,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is often seen only by experts, its dangers are misunderstood, and its importance is both overestimated and underestimated. People often ignore its mistakes or exaggerate them. Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced, and new ideas are sometimes mocked before becoming accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. This book looks at science as a series of ideas that have changed not just science but also human thought. While science has practical benefits, this book focuses on ideas, their beauty, and their limitations. Science is always changing. Scientists often disprove each other's ideas, but this usually doesn't affect society much. Sometimes, though, big changes in science can challenge our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics questioned this view, showing that observing the universe can change it. Some people think science can't fully explain the universe, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing. At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover, but then came many breakthroughs like radioactivity, X-rays, and quantum mechanics. Biology has also made many discoveries. Today, some people think we are close to a complete theory of the universe. Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last two centuries, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists need to understand scientific advances because they affect the world and future generations. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. Deciding the future is not just for philosophers; it affects budgets, health, and even life on Earth."
5,C2,"From around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised new doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement around ebooks might have led to poor investments, as his company lost faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear evidence that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books keeps coming up. Whether people are predicting or dismissing this idea, the thought of books disappearing continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see the relationship between ebooks and print books as a battle, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have explored how the idea of one medium replacing another often follows new technologies. Even before digital technologies, people predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars and on factory floors. The idea of books disappearing isn't new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, hyperlinks, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some believed the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the death of the book often appears during times of technological change. This narrative reflects our hopes and fears about technological change. To understand why these reactions are common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we develop close bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers emerges, it doesn't just mean economic and social change; it also affects our bond with something integral to our daily lives. As technology advances, we long for what we used to know but no longer have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, the spread of the printing press in 15th-century Europe made people seek original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies in the 1920s created nostalgia for the older form. The same happened with the move from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of 'old' books, even their sometimes unpleasant smell. This should reassure those worried about the disappearance of print books. Yet, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be an appealing story about the power of technology and our resistance to change. One way we make sense of change is by using familiar narrative patterns, like stories of tragedy and endings. Easy to remember and share, the story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world—and ultimately, ourselves."
6,C2,"For nearly every weekday morning over a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past 400 years managed their daily routines. I explored how they found time each day to do their best work and how they organized their schedules to be creative and productive. By examining the everyday details of their lives—when they slept, ate, worked, and worried—I aimed to offer a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers, showing them as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap afterward."" In this way, my book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the final product; it focuses on the process rather than the meaning. But it is also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even a business letter reveals something of your inner self. My book addresses questions I struggle with: How do you do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Is it better to dedicate yourself entirely to a project or to work on it a little each day? When time is limited, do you have to give up things like sleep or income, or can you learn to do more in less time, to ""work smarter, not harder,"" as my dad says? I don't claim to answer these questions definitively—some may only be resolved individually—but I have tried to show how various successful people have faced similar challenges. I wanted to illustrate how big creative visions translate into small daily actions and how working habits influence the work itself. The book is titled ""Daily Rituals,"" but it focuses on people's routines. A routine suggests ordinariness and a lack of thought; it’s like being on autopilot. However, a good routine can help you make the most of limited resources like time, willpower, and optimism. A solid routine creates a groove for your mental energies and helps avoid being controlled by moods. Psychologist William James believed that forming good habits allows us to focus on more interesting activities. Ironically, James himself was a procrastinator and struggled with keeping a regular schedule. Interestingly, it was procrastination that led to this book. One Sunday, while trying to write a story for the architecture magazine I worked for, I ended up tidying my cubicle and making coffee instead. As a ""morning person,"" I am focused in the early hours but less productive after lunch. To feel better about this, I searched online for other writers' schedules. I found them entertaining and thought someone should collect these stories, leading to the Daily Routines blog I started that afternoon and eventually this book. The blog was informal; I posted descriptions of routines I found in biographies and articles. For the book, I expanded and researched more thoroughly while keeping the original's brevity and variety. I let my subjects speak for themselves through quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources. This book wouldn't have been possible without the work of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have documented all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will guide further reading."
79,C2,"One of the most interesting changes in higher education in the UK and around the world in recent years is encouraging new students to get involved in research early in their studies. This idea is based on the belief that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making big discoveries, but it is a natural and important way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your job, as they help you think about the world and do your work. As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You don't just learn and repeat it; you create it. Creating knowledge involves asking questions instead of accepting things as they are. You might ask: Why? How? When? What does this mean? How could this be done differently? How does it work in another situation? What do we really think about the facts, views, or beliefs we are given? Why is it important? These are common questions in research. Research can range from very complex and groundbreaking work done by highly trained people to everyday inquiries that involve careful work and thoughtful questions about issues, practices, and events. Most students have been researchers in some way. You have done research for school projects or at work since you started studying. You have asked questions that led to investigations and research since you first became interested in learning. You have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, choosing a music system, or shopping online. In college and higher education, having a curious mind, identifying problems and questions, critically exploring and evaluating information and ideas, and creating your own responses and knowledge are expected learning activities. Some students may find this challenging because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and texts. It might seem disrespectful to question established knowledge and authorities, and you might feel you need to be told what is important to learn. However, in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australasia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is encouraged. This process of inquiry and knowledge creation can seem daunting. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research of others is useful to students, academics, and in the workplace, but we need to do more than just repeat what we read. We need to engage with it, think about it, test it, and decide if what we are told is logical, reasoned, and supported by evidence. We should not blindly accept facts and information given to us by others."
80,C2,"Cities have always been centers of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London gathered in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London cafés that encouraged discussion also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities can inspire creativity, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. Although city life is known to be tiring, new research shows that it can also reduce our ability to think clearly. One major reason is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for the brain. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they offer a mental break from the busy city life.
This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we are in crowded urban areas, surrounded by many strangers. These unnatural environments affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. Walking down a busy city street requires our brains to manage many things: distracted people, dangerous crossings, and the complex city layout. These tasks drain our mental energy because they force us to constantly focus and refocus our attention. The brain is like a powerful computer, but paying attention uses a lot of its power. In contrast, natural settings do not require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Natural environments capture our attention without causing negative emotions, unlike city noises like police sirens. This allows our minds to relax and recharge.
Before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to include nature in urban areas. Parks like Central Park in New York offer a break from city life and can quickly improve brain function. While people have tried many ways to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or changing office designs, few are as effective as a walk in nature. Despite the mental challenges of city life, cities continue to grow. Even in the digital age, they remain centers of intellectual life. Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that cause attention and memory problems, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities drives creativity. Just as 18th-century London was a hub of new ideas, modern cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, are centers of technological innovation. Less crowded cities may produce less innovation over time. The challenge is to reduce the negative effects of city life while keeping its benefits. As the saying goes, sometimes people feel, ""I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city!"""
81,C2,"'Where should we look for the mind? This might seem like a strange question: surely, thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain-scanning techniques to show this. While it seems natural to think of the mind as being inside the head, I believe we shouldn't limit the study of the mind to just the brain. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as neurons, are part of human thinking. From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have played a role in human evolution and the development of the mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might still be part of the mind. It is easy to see why people think the mind and brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually have around them. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limits of brain-scanning machines. But this often means we overlook that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I am not questioning the brain's role in thinking, but I want to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It would be useful to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the body into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET explores how objects become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also looks at how these processes have changed over time and what that means for how we think. This approach gives us new insights into what minds are by changing what we know about how objects affect the mind. Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The connection between the blind person and the stick helps us see minds and objects as connected. It also shows how flexible the human mind is: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick plays an active role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can change deeply by using new technologies. My approach sees the human mind as always evolving. It is important to remember that, whatever form the 'stick' has taken in our history—from early stone tools to the internet—its main role is as a pathway, not a boundary. Through the 'stick', humans explore and understand the world, but also create new paths forward. That is why a stick used by a monkey to get food is different. For humans, 'sticks' are used to satisfy our curiosity. This unique human tendency to engage with objects explains why we, more than any other species, make things, and how those things, in return, shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity—our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world. I want to include materiality in understanding the mind. MET offers a new way to understand how different forms of material culture, from stone tools to smartphones, have helped define and transform what we are and how we think. Mind-changing technology sounds futuristic, but humans have used it since they first evolved.'"
