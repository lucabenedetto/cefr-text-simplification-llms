1,C2,"'Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins – telling everyone online where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just saying, ‘Hey, I’m here’ – but you are also telling everyone, including people you might not want to meet. This showed that sharing too much online can be risky. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with the world: Wealth! Fame! So, we share our secrets, photos, and stories online. But then we find out it can be dangerous and confusing. Is this sad? Maybe, but don’t worry. There is a way to understand this future, thanks to some early internet users. In the early days of the web, they explored these dangers. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with being famous – all before social media existed. These early users, called bloggers, have already experienced what we are going through now. We should learn from them. In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ‘WWW’, as it was called then. The web was created at Cern, a physics lab in Switzerland, for researchers to share their work. Hall saw it as a way to share his life. He created a detailed story of his life with words and pictures. In January 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people read about his life. Hall shared everything: if you met him, you might be on his site; no topic was off-limits. This was the work of someone who liked attention, but it was also like art. One day, people saw his site was gone, replaced by a sad video called Dark Night. He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told ‘either the blog goes, or I do’. He said, ‘it makes people not trust me’. The blog stopped, but the problem is still here. Sharing online is fun. But if you think it will make people like you, you might be wrong. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the bosses, and she lost her job. People who study online behavior call this the ‘online distribution effect’: we feel we can say things online that we wouldn’t say in person. But the web is not a place where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives. If we forget this, we can make big mistakes. Armstrong’s story ended well. She was upset and stopped blogging for a while, but she got married and started her blog again, writing about her family. Now she is a famous ‘mommy blogger’ and her blog supports her family. She learned that just because we can say anything online, doesn’t mean we should.'"
2,C2,"Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film mixed documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Scientists usually agree with this idea because no one knows everything about the universe. However, some scientists were worried about the film and called it ""atrocious"" and ""dangerous."" 
At first, the film seemed harmless. Scientists in the film said that new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then, the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being changed by thoughts. A Japanese researcher claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. 
Many people found this evidence convincing, but scientists were skeptical. They wanted more proof that thoughts can affect water. Pretty pictures of crystals were not enough for them. 
The film's claims were not strange enough. Scientists have found that the universe is made of unknown matter and is expanding because of a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" These discoveries are based on years of research. 
Other amazing discoveries are being made. Neuroscientists found that our brain takes about half a second to process events, but we don't notice this delay. Anthropologists think they know where modern humans first lived and why they moved to other places. Some scientists believe there are links between life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Science is not finished. We are still far from knowing everything. New ideas like chaos and quantum uncertainty show that we can't understand everything completely. Scientists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all the forces and particles in the universe. Many people think the universe is best described with one word: incredible."
3,C2,"'For me, writing novels is hard, but writing short stories is fun. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, and writing a short story is like planting a garden. Both are important and make a beautiful picture together. The trees in the forest give shade, and the wind moves the leaves. In the garden, flowers bloom, and bees and butterflies come. This shows how seasons change. Since I started writing, I switch between novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I want to write short stories. After short stories, I want to write a novel. I never do both at the same time because they need different thinking. I started with two short novels in 1975, and then from 1984 to 1985, I began writing short stories. It was hard at first, but I enjoyed it. My world of stories grew bigger, and readers liked this new side of me. One of my first stories, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story book, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is nice because they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to make a short story good (though I might change it a lot). It’s not like writing a novel, which takes a year or two. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a nice change. You can make a short story from a small idea, a word, or an image. It’s like jazz music, where the story goes where it wants. If a story doesn’t work, it’s okay. Not every story is great, even for famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver. This makes me feel better. I learn from my mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from my short stories. Short stories are like a test place for me. It’s hard to try new things in a novel, so short stories help me. My short stories are like soft shadows or small footprints I leave behind. I remember each one and how I felt when I wrote it. They are like signs to my heart, and I am happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,C2,"'Science is a big part of our lives. It can help us understand the world and cure diseases. Science can make life easier, but it can also be dangerous. It tries to explain small things like ants and big things like the universe. Science is not always easy to understand, and sometimes people think it is more or less important than it really is. Scientists often disagree with each other. Old ideas are changed or replaced by new ones. This book talks about ideas in science that changed how we think. We will not focus on everyday things like frying pans. Instead, we will look at ideas and their beauty, but also their limits. Science is always changing. Scientists often find new explanations for things. Sometimes these changes are small, but sometimes they change our beliefs a lot. In the past, people thought the universe was like a big clock. Now, we know that observing the universe can change it. Some people think science cannot explain everything, but it helps us understand more and more. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes, but it keeps going. At the end of the 1800s, people thought there was nothing new to discover in physics. Then, many new things were found, like radioactivity and black holes. Biology also discovered many things. Some people think we will soon understand everything about the universe. Maybe. Science is not just for fun. In the last 200 years, we have started to control nature. Sometimes, we change nature in ways we do not understand. We need to be careful with science. Everyone should know about science because it affects our future. Science is important for our world and our children. It is not just for philosophers. Science can change things like the national budget and our health.'"
5,C2,"'Around 2015, after many years of growth, big publishers said that sales of ebooks stopped growing or even went down. This made people question the future of ebooks in the publishing world. One publishing executive said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments. His company lost some belief in the power of printed books. Even though digital and print books can exist together, people still ask if ebooks will replace print books. This idea makes us think and talk a lot. Why do we see ebooks and print books as fighting each other? The answers tell us about our feelings of excitement and fear about new things. In my research, I found that people often think new technology will replace old ones. Before digital technology, people thought TV would end radio. But radio survived by finding new uses, like listening in cars. The idea of books disappearing is not new. In 1894, people thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This has happened many times. Movies, radio, TV, and smartphones were all thought to end print books. Some people thought this would be bad for culture. Others thought ebooks were much better. The idea of books disappearing comes up when new technology appears. This shows our hopes and fears about change. We have strong feelings for things like books and TVs because they are part of our lives. Studies show we connect with objects, like naming our car or getting mad at our computer. New technology, like e-readers, means change. It makes us change our bond with things we use every day. As technology changes, we miss what we used to have. This is why industries make old products popular again. When the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people wanted original manuscripts. When movies got sound in the 1920s, people missed silent films. The same happened with digital photography and CDs. E-readers made people appreciate old books and their smell. This should comfort those worried about print books disappearing. But the idea of disappearing media will continue to be a story about technology's power and our dislike of change. We use stories of tragedy and endings to understand change. The story of the death of the book shows our excitement for the future and our fear of losing what we know.'"
6,C2,"'Almost every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write. I wrote about how some of the greatest minds in the past 400 years found time each day to do their best work. I looked at their daily schedules to see how they were creative and productive. By writing about the simple details of their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I wanted to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to show that they were like us, with habits and routines. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.’ I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.’ This book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product. It’s about how people work, not what they create. It’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever thought that even a business letter shows something of your inner self. My book looks at questions I think about in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to focus completely on a project or to work on it a little each day? When there isn’t enough time for everything, do you give things up like sleep or a clean house, or do you learn to do more in less time? I don’t have all the answers, but I have tried to show examples of how successful people have faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas come from small daily actions; how your work habits affect your work, and vice versa. The book’s title is Daily Rituals, but it’s really about people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary, but it can help you use your time, willpower, and optimism well. A good routine helps you focus and keeps you from being controlled by your moods. The psychologist William James thought you should put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself was a procrastinator and couldn’t stick to a regular schedule. This book started because I was procrastinating. One Sunday afternoon, I was alone at the small architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk and making coffee. I’m a ‘morning person’ and can focus well in the morning but not after lunch. That afternoon, to feel better, I searched the Internet for information about other writers’ schedules. I found many interesting stories. I thought someone should collect these stories in one place – so I started the Daily Routines blog that afternoon, and now, this book. The blog was simple; I posted descriptions of people’s routines from biographies, magazine profiles, and newspaper obituaries. For the book, I’ve collected more stories and done more research, while keeping the short and varied voices that made the blog interesting. I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, using quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I summarized their routines from other sources. This book wouldn’t be possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also guide further reading.'"
7,C1,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of something that happened when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money, said they could not go on holiday to Spain because of money problems. Instead, they went to the English coast. There, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From that moment, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. At university, he decided he was interested in the very early history of life, not dinosaurs. He studied small, ancient creatures in rocks.
After finishing his studies, Howard worried about finding a job. He knew he was good, but getting a job was not always fair. When a job at Tavistock College in London was available, he applied. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to help another candidate had an accident and could not attend. Another professor, who did not like the first professor, helped Howard get the job instead. Howard was happy to get the job, even though he later learned it was because of the professors' disagreement.
Howard liked his job, but he knew life could be unpredictable. One day, his briefcase with important lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. He was upset but went back to the college. There, he met a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. He learned about a new collection of fossils that needed study. This was a big opportunity for him. Because of the theft, he changed his plans. He decided not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students to Scotland. Instead, he would find a way to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,C1,"Charles Spence will eat almost anything. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. These larvae might look like maggots, but they taste ""slightly nutty, floral."" Making bug-eating normal is just one of the many food challenges Spence and his team are working on. Spence studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. His work is changing what we eat and drink, from big food companies to top restaurants. Spence and other scientists study how we experience food and drink. Who we eat with, how food looks, the color and weight of plates, and background noise all change how food tastes. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" has many interesting facts about eating. Did you know the first person to order in a restaurant enjoys their food the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when with one other person, and 75% more with three others? Spence's lab in Oxford is simple. There are soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work with cooks who can't pay for research. Much of his work is funded by a big food company. In the past, research with industry money was not seen as ""real science"" in universities. But now, universities must show their work has an impact, so this research is important. Spence is helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar. They do it slowly so customers don't notice. If you tell people about the change, they focus on the taste and don't like it as much. Spence met Heston Blumenthal, a famous chef, while working on a project. People used to think science and food didn't mix, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal and Spence created the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish. Spence says that in the early 1900s, Italian futurists tried similar things, but it didn't become popular. Now, the food industry uses Spence's research everywhere. He found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with food for passengers. Last year, a brand released an app that played music while ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste. At Spence's home, dinner parties are interesting. Once, they ate rabbit with fur on the cutlery. Another time, they used colored lights. They also tested if different drinks have different sounds. For Spence, home, shops, and food events are all part of his lab."
9,C1,"Our brains are busier than ever. We get a lot of information every day, and we have to decide what is important and what is not. We also do more things ourselves now. For example, we book our own flights and find things in shops without help. We try to do many things at once, like work, family, hobbies, and watching TV. Smartphones help us do this, but they also make us think we can do many things at the same time. 
Earl Miller, a scientist at MIT, says our brains are not good at multitasking. When we think we are doing many things at once, we are actually just switching quickly between tasks. This makes us less efficient. Multitasking can also make us stressed and confused. Our brains like new things, so we get distracted easily. 
Glenn Wilson, a psychologist, found that trying to focus on a task while having an unread email can lower our IQ by almost 10 points. Multitasking can be worse for our brains than being tired. Russ Poldrack, a scientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. For example, if students do homework and watch TV, the information goes to a part of the brain that is not good for facts and ideas.
Making decisions while multitasking is also hard for our brains. Even small decisions can use a lot of brain power. This can lead to bad decisions later. Many people say that email is a big problem because of the large amount of messages we get. We feel we must reply to emails, but it is hard to do this and finish other tasks."
10,C1,"'In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete into pieces at night to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other bats give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people did not think these questions were important. Animals had behaviors, and science studied those behaviors. The idea that animals have feelings and thoughts was not taken seriously. But now, this is changing. Research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens shows that animals' emotions are being studied more. This change has led to books like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". These books have started a debate: do animals have feelings and thoughts? This debate leads to another question: do animals know right from wrong? In a study with cows, cows that opened a gate to get food were happier than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows like solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? People do not agree on what these observations mean. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, who wrote ""Second Nature"", thinks we should stop eating meat. He believes we are close to a big change in how we think about animals. Aubrey Manning, a professor, thinks we should rethink how we see animal intelligence. He says animals have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop thinking animals are like humans. These experts may never agree because the main issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. It is hard to define what consciousness is, so can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe talks about an experiment with starlings, a type of bird, that he thinks shows they can feel sad. At Newcastle University, starlings were put in two groups. One group had nice cages with space and water. The other group had small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and not eat bad worms from another. Later, when only bad worms were offered, only the birds in nice cages ate them. Balcombe thinks the birds in bad cages felt negative about life. Balcombe, who works with animal rights groups, has strong opinions. He says, ‘We look back at racism with disgust. One day, we will feel the same about how we treat animals. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.’ If Balcombe was the only one with this view, it might be easy to ignore him. But Professor Aubrey Manning agrees with him. Manning wrote a book called ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour"". He says, ‘We are seeing a change. In the early 1900s, people thought animals thought like us, then they changed their minds. Now, we are changing again. But it is a difficult topic, and we should avoid personal opinions.’'"
11,C1,"'Critical thinking is a way to understand better what we read or listen to. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that argument can help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve problems. West says we see a lot of poor thinking and opinions that can confuse us. More data does not always mean more knowledge or better decisions. Reading books has gone down by 10%, says the National Endowment for the Arts. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, thinks that focusing more on visual media like TV and video games can reduce critical thinking. She says reading helps imagination and critical thinking, but visual media can improve some information processing. However, most visual media do not give time for reflection or analysis. This can lead to people, especially young ones, not using their full potential. How we see technology affects our views on critical thinking. Video games and learning are a big part of this discussion. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says video games can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills. They let players explore ideas in a virtual world. In the digital age, as reading and math scores go down, we need to understand how technology affects thinking.'"
12,C1,"'Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office but did not like it. He writes books about how we should live. His first book talks about the good things of working with your hands. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. He got the idea for this book while shopping. He saw ads on the credit card machine while entering his pin number. Crawford thinks these ads make it hard for us to focus. We cannot choose what to think about because of these distractions. It is hard to remember conversations or think deeply. Because of this, people do not want to talk to strangers anymore. Crawford says we see the world through things like video games and phone apps. These things take over our attention. Many people are worried about this. For example, some office workers complain about emails but still check them in their free time. Studies show that just seeing a phone on the table can distract us. There is no proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford thinks technology makes us focus too much on ourselves. We have too many choices, which makes it hard to control ourselves. This affects how we interact with others. We prefer texting to talking. Crawford says this is bad for society. He gives an example from his gym. Before, there was one music player for everyone. Now, people use earphones to listen to their own music. The gym is less social now. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distractions in public. Second, we should do activities that make us focus on real things. He mentions cooking, playing ice hockey, and racing motorcycles. These activities help us connect with the real world. They make us use our judgment and work with others. Crawford says these real experiences are better than virtual ones. He does not mean everyone should become a chef. But it is important to find ways to use our judgment. This helps us focus on what matters and makes us less tired from distractions.'"
13,C1,"""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often talk about our jobs. But when you are a philosopher, like me, it is a bit harder to answer. Saying you are a philosopher can sound a bit too proud. People might think you have special knowledge. This is not true; philosophers are like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why do people think this way about philosophers? One reason is that philosophers often think about what others do and value thinking. The Greek philosopher Aristotle said that a life of thinking is the best life. Not many modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked to thinking. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. This means we should think about our lives and not just follow what everyone else does. We can make our own choices by thinking about our lives. But you don’t need to read many books or think deeply all the time. It just means looking at our daily lives to see if they are important. It doesn’t mean living away from people to think. In fact, thinking about life should help us live better and share knowledge. This is important for a good life. Another reason people have the wrong idea about philosophers is that academic philosophy is often far from real life. This is not all the philosophers' fault. Universities focus on expensive and hard-to-read journals. So, philosophers often talk only to other experts. For most people, philosophy seems far from real life. Many philosophers do not try to change this. Universities have made philosophy seem separate, and some philosophers support this. Some areas of philosophy are very technical, and explaining them to non-experts is hard. Philosophy has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, which is about judging human actions. But this title does not fully explain my work. Ethics is often seen as rules and laws. This is a new idea in philosophy. Ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at if certain actions are fair. These are important questions, and I think about them often. But philosophy is more than this. A discussion might start with whether downloading films illegally is wrong (it is) and then look at responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps us look closely at our actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find out things we already know; other times, we see our beliefs are hard to explain. By thinking about these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,C1,"'People who love food, like chefs and food lovers, might think that thinking about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. In the past, talking about food was not as important as other big ideas. When philosophers talked about eating, it was often a way to talk about something else, like learning. Sometimes, it seemed like they were talking about food, but they were really discussing other ideas. 
An interesting example is the Greek philosopher Epicurus. He talked about enjoying life and avoiding pain in many ways. But today, his name is often linked to enjoying food and drink. We see his name in restaurants and food shops because people think it makes their food seem special. 
Food is social and cultural. It comes from history and is shared with others. We eat with friends and family, and food is grown and shared in our communities. We interact with food more than anything else, so it is a good topic to think about deeply. 
When food is ready, people talk and write about it. But why do some people have a special voice in this? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill, but some people are just better at describing it. Most studies on how we sense things focus on sight, not taste, and this should change. 
Food also has an artistic side. We say paintings or music are beautiful, but not usually food. Some philosophers think food should be part of art discussions, like sculpture or poetry. But food is eaten and gone, unlike art that lasts. 
There are many ethical questions about food. What should we eat: organic, local, vegetarian, or non-GMO? Our choices show our beliefs. Philosophers ask why we make these choices, and this is important to discuss. 
Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a duty to their guests because of love and friendship. Everyone is included in the home kitchen. Professional cooks have duties to their boss and the food, so their kitchens are not open to everyone. 
A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ talks about how food can help connect different cultures. We can learn to enjoy other cultures by eating their food and make friends by eating together. This has been important in international relations for a long time. The essay uses fun stories to show this part of food philosophy to readers.'"
15,C1,"'Rob Daviau, from the US, makes special board games called ‘legacy’ games. He thought the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a story. Could choices in one game affect the next game? He changed a classic board game called Risk to make Risk Legacy. In this game, choices have a lasting effect. Players might have to tear up cards or change the board. The game is played over several sessions, and past actions affect future games. Daviau also worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players try to stop diseases. His next game was SeaFall, set in the age of sail. Players explore and conquer new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game works. Jaime Barriga tested SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time. Sometimes the game works well at first, but later it breaks, and they have to fix it. Legacy games were not expected to be very popular. Daviau thought only a few people would like them. But many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it is a big step forward in game design. Ben Hogg, another fan, likes the adventure in legacy games. He says it is like watching a new movie each time. The legacy format is like video games and TV shows with episodes. Daviau wanted to be a TV writer but became a game designer. He likes telling stories. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock says making a legacy game is like writing a book. You need to know how it starts and ends. Daviau is happy to see others use his idea but thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, who works for the publisher of SeaFall, thinks the legacy format changes how we see board games.'"
16,C1,"'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and went into a small drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared a lot online. People enjoy stories like this because they like to think animals are like humans. Octopuses are very smart, even though they look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, and use coconut shells as armor. Some people think it is unscientific to say animals are like humans. But Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies animals like gorillas and chimpanzees, says it is wrong to ignore the human-like traits of animals. He calls this 'anthropodenial.' He says animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. In the past, people thought animals were smart. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, who created the theory of evolution, said the difference between humans and animals is not big. But in the 20th century, people started to see animals as simple machines. This was also a time when humans were destroying animal habitats. Now, de Waal believes we are starting to see animal intelligence as similar to human intelligence. He says the best tests for animal intelligence consider the animal's special skills. For example, squirrels can remember where they hide nuts, even if they fail human memory tests. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, Sy Montgomery says if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we are not smart because we cannot change our skin color. De Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean, but he knows stories like this help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment with capuchin monkeys to see if they feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got upset. A video of this experiment convinced many people of the findings. This shows how our minds work.'"
17,C1,"'Robots were once only in science fiction stories, but now they are becoming very important in our world. Robots have been used in car factories for many years. Now, experts say robots will soon be used in many more areas, and many countries are not ready for this big change. Many people think robots will do most of the work humans do in the next 50 years. But, 80% of people also think their jobs will still be the same. This is not true. All work areas will change because of robots. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, made a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. This is much faster than two human workers. In San Francisco, a company called Simbe Robotics made a robot named Tally. Tally moves around supermarkets to check if goods are in the right place and priced correctly. People who like robots say they will create new jobs for people who can fix and program them. But some people worry that robots will take away the need for human skills. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots will change jobs. He says that soon, many robots will be able to work with humans safely. In a few years, big companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will make new laws about robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics field will go up, but many jobs will not be filled because there are not enough skilled workers. Dr. Zhang says people need to learn new skills because they cannot expect to do the same job forever. New robots will also be made for homes and will interact with us in new ways. This is a big chance for companies, but it also means we need new rules to keep us safe. With many jobs at risk, education is important to prepare for the future with robots. Countries need more people studying science, technology, engineering, and maths, known as STEM, to stay competitive.'"
18,C1,"George Mallory, a famous climber, was once asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He replied, ""Because it's there."" People often wonder why anyone would do something so dangerous. Mallory's answer might inspire some people to follow their dreams. It shows that climbing can be about adventure and fun. 
In 1967, a writer named Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay about climbing. He said there are seven different types of climbing, each with its own rules. Over time, this idea has become very popular among climbers. Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. But climbing can also be difficult, like when a storm keeps you stuck in a tent. This shows a strange side of climbing: it can feel both freeing and limiting. 
Another climber, Joe Fitschen, thinks we should ask, ""Why do people climb?"" He believes climbing is in our nature. We like to take on challenges, even if they are risky. This means climbing is more about our biology than thinking it through. 
Brian Treanor, a US academic, says climbing helps us develop important qualities like courage and respect for nature. He thinks these are important in today's world. Climbing can help us grow and live better lives. 
Some climbers, like Ebert and Robinson, believe that climbing without help or technology is more challenging and deserves more respect. They think climbing alone is harder and riskier, but it can also be more rewarding. 
Climbing can also be about being in the moment and focusing on the task. This is similar to Zen philosophy, which teaches people to find peace in their minds. This is another reason why people might be drawn to climbing."
19,B2,"'For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel was very important in classical music. He was a serious and smart person who played and recorded many famous European piano pieces. He wrote and played a lot, but he did not teach much. People who knew him well saw that he could be fun, but he did not show this in his concerts. His life was full of study, travel, and playing music. 
Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel’s concerts and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not think it was a good idea. He had not taught many students before. He said, ‘You don’t ask a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ But there was something special about Kit, who was about 14 years old then. Brendel listened to him play. Brendel said, ‘He played very well and from memory. Then he gave me a CD of a small concert he did, and he played so beautifully that I thought, “I have to make time for him.” It was a performance that was good from the first to the last note. It’s rare to find a musician like this.’
As Brendel is leaving the public stage, Kit is starting to enter it. Brendel is careful because he worries that Kit might get tired too soon. Kit, now 19, is always busy when not in lessons. He learns new languages, studies math, writes computer code, or plays tennis. His mother is always watching over him. He also writes music. Brendel says, ‘This is very important. Learning to read music is easier if you try to write it yourself. Kit has a great memory and can read music very well. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and to me when I explain something. He not only understands what I mean, but he can do it. And when I tell him one thing in a piece, he will do it everywhere in the piece where it comes later.’
Brendel is careful not to make people expect too much. He says, ‘I get upset if newspapers say Kit is the future great pianist of the 21st century. It’s not good to say that. It can be harmful. Like many talented young players, he can play some things very well, but others need more time and experience. It would be bad if a critic expected him to be perfect.’
Now, at 80 years old, Brendel is more relaxed. He says, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to do certain things by the age of 50. When I was 50, I had done most of those things, but I wanted to do more, so I continued. I don’t have the physical strength now, but in my mind, there are always things happening, pieces I’ve never played. I don’t play now, but it’s a nice new career.’'"
20,B2,"'When I was little, I thought gardens were always beautiful places. Grandad’s garden was not in a dirty city. It was next to a river and went down gently to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – a place to escape and find peace. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a greenhouse, but some neighbors did. Their greenhouses were made from old windows. At home, my father was often quiet. He wasn’t boring. He liked funny things and had favorite phrases like ‘It’s immaterial to me’. He left school without finishing and became a plumber. He didn’t love plumbing. It was just his job. He and Mum once thought about moving to Canada, but they didn’t. He was good at fixing things at home, like making bookshelves. My parents moved house only once. But my mother liked to change furniture. One day, a piano came to our house. I wanted to like it, but it scared me. I liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother took them away. I never got to play the piano. My sister had lessons. When I asked my mother why I didn’t, she said, ‘You’d never have practised’. I liked the river best. I could imagine another world there. I would go with a fishing net and sandals that were too small. I’d look for fish to catch and take home. After trying to keep them alive, I put them back in the river. I wanted to leave school soon, but it seemed hard. One day, my father said, ‘There’s a job for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I thought you might like it.’ Dad didn’t like gardening, but he saw I loved it. I think he hoped it would be good for me.'"
21,B2,"Lawrence MacEwen is on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I am with him. The strong wind from the Atlantic Ocean is very powerful. It feels like it could blow us off the cliff and into the ocean below. MacEwen's sheepdog, Tie, comes close, and MacEwen gently pets him. The wind is loud, but MacEwen is comfortable on his island. He is showing me around. He points to the north and shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see rain clouds over Rum's big mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says, ‘I have sheep to move,’ as rain comes closer. We walk down the hill. As we walk, he tells me about the island: Muck is three km long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep stops our talk. Tie, the sheepdog, is trying to move the sheep but not doing well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen says, meaning the dog should go to the right. Tie goes straight into the sheep, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, sounding disappointed. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks sorry. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny. Their son Colin, who is newly married, manages the island cottages. Their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They go out and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But living on the island has challenges. For example, electricity is only available sometimes. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I see Mary preparing breakfast with a flashlight. I get used to it, along with no mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary says. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone away.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck seems surprising. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians with instruments. Their concert in the island’s tearoom is a big success, with everyone tapping their feet to the music. That night, by a warm fire, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay from a newspaper ad, without seeing it. He had never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know about farming? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it is very tasty. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to another island. Many ferries were canceled in the last two months because of high seas. If my ferry doesn’t come, I will stay on Muck for two more days. Now, with or without a phone, I secretly hope for that."
22,B2,"'At first, the game design industry was mostly for computer scientists and people who taught themselves. It was not easy to enter. People often thought it was just a hobby for young people. But now, the video games industry is serious business. Experts are not surprised. Making video games is not easy. When a new movie comes out, video games based on it need many team members and months of hard work. Like many industries, it is hard to get into, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, who works for an online games magazine, says: ‘It’s hard to make progress in big companies or to change big games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just the leaders, but also the people who design parts of the game.’ So, how can you join this competitive industry? Many companies want people with a computer science degree, but Jim thinks differently. ‘There is only one way: make games. The tools are there. You need to make something to get a job. Game design is more than a job; it is a way of life. Like any creative work, you must do it to make it real.’ Another expert, John Field, has other ideas. ‘Just doing it is good, but it’s more complicated. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs. Even fewer have the talent, skills, vision, and business sense to help the industry grow.’ Can you do it alone? ‘Maybe, but it’s hard,’ says John. ‘A good course in games can help and give support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and move up. They like all kinds of entertainment and arts. They may have worked a few years after school and decided games are for them. They are not just fans; they are interested in the future of games. Connections can help too. To get ahead in games, you need to network.’ The idea of a young boy playing games all day is old. Now, games are for everyone. Families play together on consoles. Smartphones have many new games through apps and social media. John thinks there is room to grow. ‘Games are for big audiences. They are also a great way to learn. I see many new chances and opportunities in this big area.’"
23,B2,"'Since I was a child, I have always wanted to play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I had a friend whose dad was very pushy. He always told my friend what he couldn't do. My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play football. I am glad my dad was not like that. When I score a great goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but it isn't. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. The best players in the world practice a lot, even if they have natural talent. Sometimes young players crash into each other, but I learned technique. When I teach kids, I tell them to enjoy learning skills. I used to play every sport at school, like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. I know education is important, but football was all I thought about then. The teachers did a good job, but I didn't notice it at the time. I don't want it to be like that for my son. We try to read him books, but he is too young to sit still. I hope he doesn't just want to kick them around like a football. At the start of my professional football career, the manager helped young players like me join the first team. He didn't make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to prove ourselves. I scored in the first game of the season, but we lost. A TV presenter said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to do. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely on close friends and family a lot. Having a lot of money can cause problems. People say, 'I can't believe you let your mother keep working.' I have helped my parents with money. I paid off their house loan and bought them a car. My family is strong and would not like to be on my payroll. My mum loves her job as a hairdresser, even if she doesn't earn much. I like to use my money to help people around me. I have a lot of money, but not as much as people think. After I stop playing, I want to take a year off to do things I couldn't do before. I want to go skiing right after I stop playing. I can't do that now because if I break a leg skiing, I can't play football, and I wouldn't be insured.'"
24,B2,"'We were living at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. Sam was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. He helped us find a cheap place to live because my father could not write in Los Angeles. Sam was worried about losing money and clients. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs covered the sun. Reef Point was not popular with day visitors. The road was not nice, and the nearby resort, La Carmella, was more attractive. People only came to Reef Point if they had no money or loved surfing. But now, with the hot weather, many people came. After months alone, we were surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy writing a script and was in a bad mood. I often went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty. We did not have a dog when we moved to Reef Point, but Rusty chose us. I gave him water, and he stayed. My father said, ‘He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and brought me things he found. Sometimes, he brought things that were not his, like a new shoe or a towel, and I returned them. Rusty liked to swim with me, even though I swam faster. He never got discouraged. That day, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver his script. Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. One surfer was very good. She finished surfing and came to talk to me. She asked why I didn’t join them. I said I didn’t have a surfboard and no money. She asked if I was British and visiting. I said I lived there and my father was writing a film script. She asked his name, and I said Rufus Marsh. She knew his book, Tall as the Morning, and was interested in me after that.'"
25,B2,"""‘What have I done?’ Violet Hetherington asked herself. She was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton. The lines were very long and not moving. Her friend Annie had told her, ‘It’s best to get to the docks late. If you get there too early, you will wait a long time.’ Annie, who was married to a diplomat, traveled a lot and gave advice. But this time, her advice was wrong. After a while, an announcement said there was a ‘problem with the computer system.’ The people waiting were not happy. Some tried to be patient, some tried to be cheerful, but most were upset. They had paid a lot of money for this trip. This might be their last chance for some luxury. Not being able to get on the ship easily was not a good sign. Violet wanted to leave. She looked in her bag for her phone and saw it was missing. This was more annoying than the long lines. It made her feel that going on a cruise was a mistake. And now she had the problem of the phone. She couldn’t call the taxi company to check if she left it in the taxi, because the number was in her phone. Her older son Harry always told her to avoid this mistake. Behind her in the line was a friendly-looking couple. ‘I’m sorry, but I left my mobile phone behind. Could I borrow yours to make one call?’ Violet called Harry on the couple’s phone and left a message asking him to ask Kristina, her neighbor, to check if the phone was at home. If it was not in her flat, she would be in trouble, as she had no other way to find the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her thought, Thank goodness. But she did not tell Harry this. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother. Daniel, her younger son, was more understanding of her mistakes because he made them too. Dan might forget to give the message to Kristina. Finally, the lines started to move, and Violet gave her travel documents and got ready to go on the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship’s foyer. It looked like a hotel that tried to be fancy but wasn’t. There were shiny fake wood panels, big chandeliers, polished brass, and carpets like those in airports. Violet followed the signs to the ‘Elevators’ which had mirrors everywhere. The elevators were full of tired passengers who might not want to see themselves in the mirrors. Violet was pressed against the side of the lift as it went up, stopping at each floor to let people out. At last, on the twelfth floor, she got out. Her room had the balcony she wanted. She had been worried about what to say if it didn’t. Ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a last-minute deal, she paid the most she could to be sure of the sea view."""
26,B2,"'When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he did not know he was discovering the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof wanted pictures for a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer who took interesting pictures. Now, Maloof has a big collection of Maier’s work. In his home, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, plus many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked at all of it and realized he found something special by luck. ‘When I bought this, I didn’t know what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I could have sold it all to someone else.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are learning about Maier’s life. They talked to families she worked for as a nanny and people from the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier was a private person and always had a camera with her. She wore big coats, wide hats, and strong shoes. ‘On her day off, she would leave with her camera and come back late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. She was not very social, but she liked to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, sometimes recording them on audiotape. She was very focused on her ‘second job’, taking pictures of the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and did what she wanted,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; she did not do it for money. Her pictures often show women, children, the old, the poor, and abstract scenes. ‘Vivian’s pictures are very interesting,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of other photographers in her work and wonders if she created her own style. ‘Was Vivian very skilled or did she copy ideas from others?’ Maloof wonders if he will ever look at all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof cabinets. The funny thing is he was not interested in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her pictures, Maloof started taking his own photos. ‘As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I saw that people and street scenes were important to her,’ he said. ‘There was much more to her work than I thought. Now, we want to make her name known. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,B2,"'When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I talked to her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer. The officer looked at it and asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. Some crimes have happened, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past gave more chances for problems for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I ask how it feels to be successful at a young age, she says, ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels the success is partly theirs. People at home are very supportive.’ Then she adds, ‘It’s annoying when people think I’m not trying to do something philosophical in the book.’ Catton wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral. Each part is half the length of the one before it. The book speeds up as it goes. I ask if it matters if the reader notices this. ‘I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them,’ she says. Despite the book's structure, it is still an exciting murder mystery. Surprisingly, she says she didn’t plan the book beforehand. ‘I would write myself into a corner and then see how I could get out of it.’ She also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We also talk about her love of TV drama series. I ask if she might want to write for TV. ‘That could be cool,’ she says. She is very enthusiastic and laughs often. She loves talking about her work and New Zealand. ‘When I come to Britain, I notice how my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to busy places, to be around more people.’ But for now, New Zealand will stay her home. I hope it gives her ideas for more novels.'"
28,B2,"'When Jonny Kinkead was a boy, he liked to make things in his dad’s garage and play the guitar. These two hobbies became his job for the last forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I still love the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can two pieces of wood make a beautiful sound? And by using different types of wood, you get different sounds? It still amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. At sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a job and save money to buy one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and wood types changed the sound, and how to put them together.’ The bass was the first instrument Jonny made from scratch, but he and his brothers had been making other things for a long time. ‘We drew model boats and planes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use saws and sharpen chisels. I also fixed instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar was good, but he didn’t think about making guitars as a job. ‘I also liked painting and sculpture,’ he says. After school, he decided to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture is about design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea,’ he remembers. But halfway through, he left. ‘I was too independent for it,’ he says. ‘But I left with a better idea of what I wanted to do. I still liked sculpture, but I realized guitar-making is like sculpture – it’s about shaping sound. And I thought it might be more practical than pure art because you make things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only covered the cost of materials, but as he became known as a great guitar-maker, he could charge more. Even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just making a living’. He can only make ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. In the early years, he worked hard to become known. He went to music festivals on weekends and got musicians to try his guitars and talk about him. He also had to learn how to price his guitars – when musicians asked, he didn’t know because it wasn’t natural for him. Jonny thinks it’s easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today. ‘When I started, people thought the best acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as good, even though we have always had good courses and skills here. But now our hand-made guitars have the reputation they deserve.’ Jonny says you can learn valuable techniques in class, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take courses. But he also believes there is no substitute for trial and error. ‘Look at other instruments, see what works or doesn’t, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If someone else teaches you, you learn one way, but if you teach yourself, like I did, you learn everything.’'"
29,B2,"'When English people talk, they often start with the weather. This is a tradition. A famous writer, Dr Johnson, said, ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This was true 200 years ago and is still true today. Many people think English people talk about the weather because they are interested in it. But this is not true. The American writer Bill Bryson says the English weather is not exciting. There are no tornadoes or big storms. The English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman says the weather is interesting because it is always changing. My research shows that both are wrong. English people talk about the weather to start conversations. When someone says, ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ or ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’, they are not really talking about the weather. They are just starting a conversation. This is like monkeys grooming each other to make friends. English people use weather talk in three ways: as a greeting, to start a conversation, or when they don’t know what else to say. This makes it seem like they talk about the weather a lot. So, people from other countries think English people are very interested in the weather.'"
30,B2,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain. She was trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how amazing it was that the Romans built a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were interested because they chose this trip over trips to Spain, Greece, or France. They wanted to know why the wall was built, but Alice felt her answers were not good enough. She couldn't find a historical novel to help explain life at the Wall in Roman times, so she decided to write one herself.
Alice retired from teaching after 31 years and started writing in 2001. She felt it was a big change. Teaching was like acting, very demanding, but writing was exciting and less tiring. Her old teaching friends were jealous because she still connected with children through her books. Alice wanted her books to fill a gap in children's fiction. She thought many books for young people were about negative experiences or total fantasy, like Harry Potter. Her books were different.
Alice liked to teach English and History together, like teaching about ancient Greece with the novel Tale of Troy. She loved seeing children go from being bored to interested. Writing was like teaching for her. She started writing because there was a gap in the market and because her sons were leaving home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, which surprised her. She didn't want to spend her summer on a course she thought she didn't need.
Before the course, she had to send her best piece of fiction. She quickly wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby. The course students liked her story and suggested she publish it. With only school report cards as proof of her writing, she asked for a year off to write her first novel. Her husband, Zachary Leader, is a critic and editor, and he helped her a lot. Alice says they work well together. He helps improve her writing by changing sentences and suggesting new words, while she likes to add more scenes."
31,B2,"'To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company asked brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to join a special race. The race was between a man and a car, and also between the two brothers. In the wild and hilly Yorkshire Dales in northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same place. Jonny would drive a car on the roads, and Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. ‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and it’s very cold now, so I’ll be warm in the car.’ Alistair was also excited. He wore full winter cycling clothes, while Jonny wore jeans and a sweatshirt. Alistair was confident. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’ll make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’ The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, 350 meters up. It was easy for the car, but Alistair had to climb a steep hill at the start. After a quick handshake, they began. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside to Fleet Moss. Jonny got in the car and drove on the road. They would see each other again at the finish line. Who would get there first? Jonny’s confidence dropped quickly. Just 15 seconds into the drive, he faced a problem. A big tractor came out of a field and onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he said to the cameraman in his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s because of this farmer!’ After the tractor moved, Jonny was back on the road. Alistair was having a hard time with the hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched him as he walked with the bike on his shoulders. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side, the ground was open, and the sun was shining. Alistair started to go faster. In the car, Jonny faced another problem. The roads in this part of Yorkshire are very old and narrow. Jonny had to drive slowly around a tight corner and through a stream on the road. After the last village, the road was straight to the finish line. Neither brother knew where the other was. As Jonny drove fast to Fleet Moss, Alistair was riding across his last field and back onto the road. He reached the finish line and stopped. Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the crowd. ‘No? Really?’ He raised his arms in victory. Minutes later, Jonny arrived in the car. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said sadly. ‘I’m disappointed.’'"
32,B2,"'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds make you feel separate from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hard to focus only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point is over: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels far away. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused I forget there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my coach, told me from a young age that this was the biggest tournament. By 14, I was telling my friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The loss in 2006 was not so hard. I was happy just to be there at twenty. Federer beat me easily because I didn’t believe enough. But losing in 2007 was very hard. I knew I could have done better, and it was my mind that failed me, not my ability. I cried a lot after that loss. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, who is a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me; he criticizes me even when I win. But he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this was probably my last chance to win. I know the career of a professional athlete is short, and I want to make the best of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more, and I let a big one pass in 2007. Toni couldn’t ease my sadness. Yet he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was sure I learned from that defeat; this time, my mind would not fail. The best sign was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family and friends the night before the final, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t tell them not to talk about it, but they knew I was already playing the match in my mind. Until the start of play, that space was mine alone.'"
33,B2,"'A young Englishwoman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in April 1957. She wrote to her family, ""I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa. She became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. In 1963, Britain's National Geographical Society made her famous with articles and TV shows about her work with chimpanzees. Jane Goodall wrote many books, including a bestseller called ""In the Shadow of Man,"" which has been translated into 47 languages. She is one of the most famous female scientists of the 20th century. Some people think her fame hides her real achievements. Many stories about her life focus on her adventures and dreams, but they do not always show what she really did. Jane Goodall is a pioneer in her field and a leading zoologist. She helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people did not know that chimpanzees ate meat or used tools. We also did not know that chimpanzees have emotions and social systems like humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is very important for chimpanzee research. Her study of wild apes in Gombe, Nigeria, is called one of the great scientific achievements. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves. Even as a child, Jane showed signs of her future career. When she was five years old, she disappeared one day. The police and her family looked for her. She came back with straw in her hair. She had been in a henhouse for five hours to see how hens lay eggs. This was the start of her interest in biology.'"
34,B2,"'During our first conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using different voices. She sounds like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny old Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are known to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to say many medical words.’ Shirley talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors think they can do funny voices, and many of them can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it. You have to make the script come alive for people who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions, but often they don’t get parts because they are used to acting with their whole bodies.’ After school, Shirley took a drama course to become a regular actor. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a big part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’ Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex rules and many forms, which production companies want to avoid. Shirley has learned to make the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the best part of a job that includes many things from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this job help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and happy. When I do animation work, it feels like a holiday; working with other actors makes a big difference.’ The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is important. ‘It’s worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that help voiceover artists make them.’ She says she got where she is – near the top of her profession – through hard work as much as talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or just practising your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’ For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a love for human sound is important, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she is performing. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a certain kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’'"
35,B2,"'People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many kids dream about, like being a race car driver. But most people stop dreaming about these jobs and think about more realistic ones, like being a lawyer or making car parts. The idea that you can make money by drawing doodles like the ones in school notebooks seems silly. But some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, I loved comic strips as a child, drew for school papers, and was known as 'the kid who draws.' I studied graphic design in college and showed my drawings to different companies after I graduated. I was lucky to find a newspaper that needed political cartoons. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and soon I was making enough money to live on. You don’t need much to be a cartoonist. You don’t need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be great at drawing. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. Being a cartoonist is hard. You shouldn’t try it unless you feel you can’t do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and gives you time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t say no to work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want. It helps to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about everything. What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs with newspapers and magazines. But those days are almost gone. Now, cartooning is more like running your own business. You have to make and sell your work. Cartoonists with good business skills often do better than those who are very artistic but not good at business. I often meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they don’t let others see their work! To protect your work, just draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright,’ put a circle around it, and write your name and the date. But it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it becomes popular online, it’s not a disaster – it can be a lucky break!'"
36,B2,"'Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and cleaning out old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to throw this guitar away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to put it on a pile of rubbish. Then, a young man came up to me and asked, ‘You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?’ I said yes, but I already felt a little regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said ‘Yes’. We went our separate ways. In the days and years after, I felt sad about what I’d done. Then, a few months ago, I got an email that changed my life. I remembered a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it in a fish ten years later. That’s how I felt when I read this email from a man named Keith Rushton. He was a dealer and restorer of guitars. He said, ‘I’ve got your electric guitar.’ The guitar had been bought and sold many times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back. He used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I almost cried. I would have given Keith anything he asked for, but his price was fair. I forgot that my dad put name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed about this! My parents wanted me to learn the classical guitar in the 1970s because it was popular. I loved the sound of the classical guitar, but I couldn’t make much progress. So I switched to the electric guitar. This was also the time of punk music, when people who couldn’t play well could still be rock stars. When I got my old guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. It felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I held it sitting down, then stood up and put a strap over my shoulder. The electric guitar is played standing up. My fingers remembered how to play. I couldn’t draw a diagram of the chords, but my hands knew them. My fingers felt the pain of holding down the strings. The electric guitar is not really a solo instrument. Now that I’m learning it again, I think I’ll have to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe I can play with him. Or maybe there are other people my age who have had a similar experience. Maybe we could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!'"
37,B2,"'There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who cannot sleep, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep affects our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important sleep is for our mental, physical, and social health. It is good that sleep is getting more attention now. But what about dreams? I have not heard much about dreams in the discussion. We lose dreams when we wake up early and cut off the last hour or two of sleep. This is mostly REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, which is the stage with the most dreams. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen in REM sleep, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. If someone lives 90 years, they will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more and stronger REM sleep the next night. This shows that dreams are important. When researchers found REM in 1953, many agreed with Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, who said that understanding dreams helps us understand our minds. But it was not that simple. Later research did not support this idea. Now, dream studies focus more on the physical side of dreams. There is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Robert Stickgold, a sleep scientist at Harvard University. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study. The study found that actors, writers, and directors remember and use dreams better than other people. Pagel thinks that using dreams is linked to being interested in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are only artistic people using their dreams? Don’t all people – like teachers, software designers, and politicians – need to think creatively? Stickgold says dreams help us connect things in new and surprising ways. Dreams use our past and present knowledge to find new ideas. For example, Stickgold found that when people wake up from REM sleep and are asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they wake up from other sleep stages. They ignore the obvious and make unexpected connections. This is what creativity is, says Stickgold. I write better after intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come quickly. I do not know how it works, but it does. But creativity is not just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly in our relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream.'"
38,B2,"'Susie Ray left London twenty years ago to live in a small town by the sea in south-west England. In her studio, you see empty frames and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a famous copyist artist. She can paint like famous artists from the past, such as Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies look so real that even art experts can be fooled. The original paintings are worth millions, but Susie's copies sell for a few hundred to £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie has many clients, including galleries and private collectors. Some collectors like to show off her copies as if they were originals. One famous person likes to say he has a 'Van Gogh' when it is really a 'Susie Ray Van Gogh'. Some people keep the original painting in a bank and hang Susie's copy at home to save on insurance. Susie is honest about her work. She signs her name on the back of the canvas. It is illegal to sell a copy as an original, and Susie does not do that. She knows people who have gotten into trouble for selling fakes. Susie was not always a copyist. After her art degree, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. It was hard work and did not pay well, but it helped her learn to be accurate. She advises young artists to learn to draw well and study a lot. Susie can draw plants, make perfect copies of old paintings, and reproduce modern art. She likes French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. Some people think modern art is easy, but Susie says it is not. The impressionists painted quickly but carefully, which is hard to do. Susie does not create her own art because she enjoys copying and makes a good living from it. She once tried painting fishing nets, but they looked like photos. Susie is a perfectionist.'"
39,B2,"During her racing days, Ellen MacArthur loved the sea more than anything else. She wanted to be the fastest person on it. From childhood, she was obsessed with sailing. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. When she was on land, she found everyday life boring and wanted to be back on the ocean. After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home for 94 days. She talked about how she planned everything carefully, even counting how many rolls of kitchen paper she needed. Preparation was very important to her. She showed me her freeze-dried food, small gas stove, and medical supplies. The boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.
Now, Ellen sees the world like a boat. She thinks it is small and beautiful, but its supplies are running out. Her view changed after a trip to South Georgia, an island in the south Atlantic. There, she helped with a bird survey and saw many old whaling stations. This made her think about how we take what we want and move on. When I visit Ellen’s office, she tells me why we must act now to save the planet. She says coal, oil, and gas are precious and we have to find ways not to use them up. At first, she thought we should use less, but now she talks about re-using things. For the last three years, she has visited factories and talked to people about using non-renewable resources. She started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that helps young people think about a sustainable future. Ellen misses the adventure of being at sea, but she believes her new work is more important. She says, ""I may have been the fastest around the world, but this is the most important thing I’ve ever done."""
40,B2,"'Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he does it, he could become very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and games, so Jordan hopes to inspire them to go outside and try new things. Jordan's team includes his father, Paul, and mother, Karen. They call themselves 'Team Romero'. Climbing Everest is just one of their goals. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of them and might finish before he turns 20. Some famous Everest climbers think it is not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world's highest mountain. They say a young climber might be strong, but they worry if a teenager is emotionally ready. They also think a young person might not have enough experience to make good decisions while climbing. The Romeros know people have these opinions. Paul says, 'I know people criticize us, but I can't worry about it – we have a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks, but we believe our experience will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He is becoming strong and mature.' I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it because his father wants him to? Paul says, 'This is not about me trying to be famous because of my son. At first, Jordan talked about doing it later, but we thought: 'Why not now?' We talk to him often to make sure he still wants to do it.' When I ask Jordan why he likes the challenge, he says, 'I just focus on my goal.' In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain. Now, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record challenge. This gives Jordan a problem. People might say that trying to set records is more important than enjoying the climb, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to share his story. This means writing online, taking photos, and giving interviews. He has to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. 'And you know what?' Paul says. 'If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we will stop this project and go to the gym.'"
41,B2,"'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, they are probably not listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends about Brahms, they don't know who he is. I am studying music at university, but my classmates don't know much about classical music either. If you don't know who wrote the music, you probably don't have any of their recordings. The numbers are not good for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical CD sells only 300 copies. I find that hard to believe. Why is there less interest in classical music, which has been around for centuries? Older people blame TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is, classical music doesn't attract many people, especially teenagers, who buy the most music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical concerts, but they are few. Even though I play in an orchestra, I'm not a big classical music fan. I like many styles, but I don't listen to much classical music. So why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Experts say we can't pay attention for more than about three minutes, which is too short for most classical pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. Pop music topics are more interesting to teenagers than long classical pieces without words. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families played music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music online, but we rarely listen to classical music. When did you last hear classical music in a shop? One of my teachers says more people go to classical concerts now, but I think not many are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but I mostly see older people in the audience. I don't know why more people like classical concerts when they are older, but I know if your parents like something, you might avoid it. Some say schools are to blame for teenagers not liking classical music, but many kids are excited to play in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. They like classical music when they play it, but it's not their favorite music to listen to. When we relax, we choose pop music.'"
42,B2,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said quietly. Her mother was getting out of the other side of the car and didn’t hear her. Bonnie didn’t mind if her mother heard because her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school with many buildings hidden among trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first. Then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of behind me,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be in trouble soon anyway,"" she thought, ""so why not start now?"" She left the building and went to the riding centre. There was an old building for the horses and a large place for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She was respectful as she went to the horses. Bonnie liked horses. The horses were well cared for, she could see that. Almost every stall had a horse, and she looked at each one carefully. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony as she touched its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""You’re the best one!"" she said. He was brown with some white. He looked lively, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" said Bonnie, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. She wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle."" The room with the riding equipment was unlocked. Bonnie was happy. She forgot about her mother and the headmaster as she put a saddle on Maverick. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed when she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said. ""I’m not joking because I know about horses, even if I don’t know about other things."" She made him walk, then trot. ""If I stay here, we could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and the breeze felt good on her face. She felt Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he would jump well."

44,B2,"'I jumped out of bed, moved the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I looked up the river at the sandbags. They were there to stop the buildings from flooding when the ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them. Last week, I worked with many people from the town for long hours. I wanted to show I could do it. But my grandfather didn’t notice much. I looked at the half-mile of dark water from the factory in Milltown. There was ice on both sides, and then solid ice downstream. As I took off my pyjamas and put on my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. I didn’t know him. He was trying to balance on the ice near the warm water from the factory. I put on my kayaking jacket and checked the pocket for my lucky chain. My famous grandfather brought it back from South America. Only he, my mom, and I know about it. I also have his diary from that trip. I keep it under my pillow and read it before I sleep. I touched the chain and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled as I took a banana. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training. Be careful.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I walked down the hall and almost bumped into Grandpa. ‘Watch where you’re going,’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ My wetsuit should have made it clear. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry. ‘Why train? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. His words hurt, but I took a deep breath. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Mom came with a kind smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself right now,’ I finished. I didn’t say he’s always been like that. But I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero. He showed me photos of him in National Geographic. Those photos are still on his wall, above his medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own trophies now, and maybe one day, my face will be in National Geographic. Still, a part of me wants to stay close to him. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination, even on cold days!’ I smiled back and peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my trip.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I went to the backyard and hurried to the boathouse.'"
45,B2,"Mum took Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was a painting. It was one of Grandpa's, but different from his other work and not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in it, but not one she knew. It might not even be a real river, just a fantasy one. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely there, just a hint of green. The eye was drawn to the pale waters and a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people, and it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this picture. Yet, Jess was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, hiding her excitement. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others understand them if they could. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? Maybe he will add the boy later. I asked him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without explaining it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. If artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting, since you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire?"" ""Someone who gives an artist ideas."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint. He would say the muse wasn't kind to him today or he needed to be nice to the muse for a difficult part. He never suggested the muse was her. She thought it was a goddess, not a person. It was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,B2,"'When I woke up this morning, I did not plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I am not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I tripped over the bed with Dad’s knife in my hand, the knife might have cut the carpet by itself. I am not saying this happened, just that it could have. I did not mean to damage the carpet. I did not wake up thinking, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, I wondered why I thought that, but it was too late. This happens to me a lot. I am unlucky that way. I was not thinking about cutting holes. I was trying to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It is very cute! It is small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it. I keep my shells, fossils, and interesting stones there. Gran knew I loved her cabinet. I was so happy when she gave it to me! But it is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle. It has to stand in a corner. I have only two corners in my bedroom. My room is the smallest in the house, under the roof, and shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But Angela is only fifteen, so I will be in my small room for years. I do not mind; I like my little bedroom. It is cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is, there are not enough corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried to fit Gran’s cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was a little too tall. If I could cut a few centimetres off the bottom... Then I had an idea. If I could not cut the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. Dad calls this lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box’. And that is what I was doing!'"
47,B2,"The novel ‘The Borrowers’ is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in a house. They secretly take things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV show of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people’s expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should look. I used the original drawings from the book because I didn’t want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' view, not a human one, which made filming harder. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or going on a mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimetres to get the Borrowers' view. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when the tiny Borrowers were combined with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called and asked how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully strange. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act. One important thing for me was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off because she was sewn into it every morning. The lead actor’s trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, it was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was pretty successful in showing the magic of the books."
48,B2,"'Mom stops the car at the corner of my new school, Palm Grove High School. She looks around nervously, checking for journalists that aren’t there. I wonder how long it will take before the craziness starts. It always does. The fake smiles, the people who want to be friends, the ""can-you-get-me-free-tickets-to-your-dad’s-concerts?"" ‘Everything’s going to be fine,’ I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone with this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. To leave my old life on the road and with tutors. So while the rest of the band is here for recording, we’re staying for good. I wanted to come to this school because I want to meet real kids. Maybe a kid with a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass. That would be so cool. So normal. I walk into the school’s main office. ‘Hi, I need my schedule please,’ I tell the school secretary. ‘Name?’ She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ‘Desert McGraw.’ ‘Desirée?’ she asks, leaning closer. ‘Desert,’ I repeat. The secretary seems confused. ‘Oh,’ she says and types ‘McGraw’ on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people know my last name because my dad uses his stage name. ‘What grade?’ ‘Eleventh.’ ‘One second, it’s printing,’ the secretary says. Then she gives me the paper. English Literature, first period. Cool, I like that. English is my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map last night, so I don’t look lost. When I get to the door, I hear the teacher calling names. ‘Aurelio Gonzalez.’ ‘Here.’ She continues while I slip in quietly and sit in the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes look at my normal outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! ‘Nice shoes,’ she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. ‘Thanks,’ I say. The teacher pauses. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says slowly. ‘Here.’ The teacher smiles and says her name is Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she gives us time to talk! All teachers should do this. ‘So why’d you move here?’ my new friend asks. I have many choices. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras and reporters? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ‘We need a change, Desert,’ he said, ‘and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.’ Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they pick a studio near the sand? ‘My dad had to move,’ I tell her. Yes, lies work better. ‘What does he do?’ she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone will find out soon, anyway. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal. ‘He’s an artist,’ I say, playing with my backpack zipper. ‘Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.’ And she doesn’t care. Excellent.'"
49,B2,"'Today, American teenage girls are expected to do many things. They should be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what it means to be a teenager in America now. Teenage boys and girls cannot just go to school and be average. Being average is not enough. People think that if you do not try hard, you are lazy. Teenager Kristen Loose says, ‘People forget how much pressure teenagers have now. We have a lot of homework, tests, activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. We also try to have a social life.’ Even though these pressures are normal for teenagers today, people still have negative ideas about them. They think teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. Some people think this is not fair. Kristen Loose says, ‘Many people think we spend most of our time watching TV and using our phones.’ Loose thinks this is not true. She keeps her phone close, but not just for fun. It helps her and others. Students today need to be connected to the world and reachable all the time. This makes it look like they are addicted to their phones. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can do their work anywhere. They can even listen to language lessons on the way to school. Schoolwork and activities do not stop at the school gate. They need attention all the time. Many teenagers start their day at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and finish after midnight. Their day is full of school, activities, family duties, and homework. They get up and do it all again the next day, with less than nine hours of sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation found that only 20 percent of teens get nine hours of sleep a night. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school once a week because they do not get enough sleep. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says she has about 18 hours of free time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 hours is not much. Olsen does not waste this time on social media or TV. She spends a lot of time volunteering. Olsen says, ‘People think teenagers only care about themselves and their own interests.’ But Olsen says her favorite time is when she volunteers. ‘I like helping others and want to make a positive impact in my school and community.’ In 20 years, we do not know what people will think about teenagers, but they will still prove these ideas wrong and make the world better. There will be another group of students who will change the world before they finish school.'"
50,B2,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a small town in the US near the Sierra Nevada mountains. This group has sent over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. Their project is both a science experiment and an adventure, which is why teenagers like it. I joined them one weekend in late spring. They were about to release a high-altitude balloon to try to record shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere, making a light trail. As it got dark, the teenagers attached a soft insulated lunch box to the balloon. Inside the box was a camera, a tool to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers were on the outside to help find the box later. A gas tank, given by someone from a nearby state, was used to fill the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car. An older boy drove seven hours to get the gas. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he said. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it was time to launch. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they counted, and the balloon went up. Some of them ran and followed it with flashlights until it was out of sight. There was a quiet feeling of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared into the night. After the launch, most students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets and looked at the clear sky. It was hard to believe they were just four hours from Los Angeles, a big city with about 4 million people. I saw a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We’re the only ones talking,’ said one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispered another. A meteor crossed the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon gets bigger until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Finding it is not easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is not much land with people around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in the middle of nowhere. ‘To me, finding the lunch box is a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader. They have lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘We have learned a lot about this area,’ he said. This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop. To get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the other side. They had to decide if driving or walking was better. It could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘These students are from the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader said. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to them.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was on a flat rock in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It was a bit disappointing, but it was a chance to talk about atmospheric waves and how they work over mountains. And it was another adventure story to share."
51,B2,"Chloe Morgan says she didn't like science, especially Palaeontology, until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. Her younger brother loved dinosaurs, which is common for kids, but Chloe didn't care much. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new dinosaur discoveries. It amazed her, and she knew she wanted to learn more about it.
Chloe met her first palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous. She was nervous because she thought he might find her annoying with her questions. But he was patient and listened to her, which made her feel comfortable.
Chloe talks about how movies and TV shows show palaeontologists. She says films like Jurassic Park make people interested in dinosaurs but not always in Palaeontology. She thinks movies show palaeontologists as either strange geniuses or awkward people, which is not true. Her job is very different. She digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs, and writes for science magazines. She also likes to explain science to people, especially young ones, to help them understand more about science.
Chloe helped with a TV show called Walking with Dinosaurs. She says the show was mostly accurate, and she only needed to check small details, like if dinosaurs shown together lived at the same time. The show was popular because it showed dinosaurs in a new way, different from movies like Jurassic Park.
Chloe thinks dinosaurs are interesting because they make us curious and remind us there is still much to discover. She says Palaeontology is like time travel because it helps us learn about the past."
52,B2,"""I will say this once: when you travel by car with your family, even if you are six years old, you know you are not 'there yet,' even if you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' When you arrive, it is not 'there' anymore; it is 'here.' So, if you think you are 'there,' you should ask 'Are we here yet?' Parents want to be 'there' more than kids do because they hear this question many times during long car trips. Kids should not complain. Think about it. Wouldn't you like to relax in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while the view outside changes. In the front seat, mum or dad gives out juice boxes and cookies, changes the radio, and keeps everything running smoothly. Are we there yet? I hope not. But then, someone in the car does something bad – usually my younger brother, Tim. He puts his foot on my side of the seat. He can't do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then he puts his other foot, then a hand, and soon he is in my space, and we start fighting. The driver and mum or dad separate us and tell Tim to stay in his seat. This makes things calm for a while. The nice views outside continue. Later, I try to read, and I feel a breeze on my arm. The window is not open, so where is it from? Tim is blowing on me. He is not touching me, so he thinks he is not doing anything wrong. But I get angry. Tim gets in trouble, and there is more swerving. Then things calm down again. Over the years, Dad has found ways to deal with us in the back seat. When we ask 'Are we there yet?' he often says, 'Yes. Get out of the car.' 'But Dad, we are still on the highway.' 'Oh, maybe we are not there yet.' This makes us quiet for a while. You know you are 'there' when the adults get out of the car and move away from the kids. So remember: if mum and dad can still answer your question, then the answer is: no, you are not there yet."""
53,B2,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK. In their café, people can drink coffee, eat cake, and play board games. John and Zuzi hope people will enjoy this and come back again. Zuzi says they started the café because people are always on their phones and gadgets. They want people to talk and have fun together without screens.
The games in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have simple themes like farming. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, made by Klaus Teuber from Germany. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources. Everyone stays involved until the end, and no one feels left out. Later, 'co-operative' games were made, where players work as a team. One example is Pandemic, made by Matt Leacock from North America. In Pandemic, players solve global problems together. Leacock was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings. He wanted to make games that everyone enjoys, win or lose.
Leacock loved board games since he was a child, even though he was often disappointed by them. With his uncle, he tried to make better games. Pandemic became very popular, and its new version has a lot of storytelling. It is like a video game where you develop characters and the story changes.
Video games have helped board games become popular. Many people play games on their phones now. Ben Hogg, who works for a games company, says more people are open to playing games. Before, people played video games together in the same room. Now, many video games are played online, and players are not together physically. So, some people want to play games with others in person again.
John and Zuzi's café shows that board games are more than just fun. In our online world, people like to share games in real life, and this trend will continue."
54,B2,"Jamie Scott has written and produced many big UK songs. His story shows why hard work is important in the music business, even if your career starts slowly. Jamie's mother was a great singer and taught him guitar. He only listened to a local radio station for older people, which influenced him as a child. He was 12 when he first heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he was very good at, and music. He spent his school lunchtimes playing piano. He says, ""I was good at tennis, but it was too much work, and I didn't want to do it forever."" At 17, he left school to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who played guitar but didn't want a music career. Jamie told his parents he wanted to make music, writing lyrics in class and playing piano every day. His dad gave him 18 months to succeed, or he would need to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he signed with a music publisher at 19 because of one song. But record labels wanted him solo, so he left his friend. He became famous behind the scenes, not on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he switched to another but didn't become famous. He says, ""In my artist career, I was often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as a writer, I was in the right place."" Writing for others is where he succeeded. He says he is one of the main writers in the UK, helping new artists start their careers. He sometimes tells artists that writing popular songs is good. ""Don't you want 10 million people to listen to your music?"" he asks. He wants to write great songs that sell well. Jamie is honest about wanting to write number-one songs. He knows he has the talent to do it. He focuses on writing the best music. ""When I go into the studio, we aim to write the best music of next year,"" he says. ""We want to write classic modern pop songs."""
55,B2,"Tony Connor is a new kind of famous person. He is very popular online, but people who do not watch online videos might not know him. Tony is a 'street trials cyclist'. This means he jumps his bike from one difficult place to another, like from a roof to a wall. These jumps are filmed and shared online.
I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many local boys knew him, and even older people came to say he is 'an absolute legend'. After watching him, I agreed. I was surprised by his bravery and creativity. Before each jump, Tony explained what he wanted to do. I was not sure he could do it, but he always did. When I praised him, he did not seem very happy. Even though he is famous online, Tony does not like being a celebrity. He says, 'I find the social side of it difficult. I like doing things more than talking about them.'
Tony's fame comes from social media and new camera technology. He says, 'This technology helps people like me make a living.' But he also thinks people spend too much time with cameras and screens. He is not complaining, though. His videos help him earn money from what used to be just a hobby.
I have learned that to become a top athlete, you need energy and the ability to handle disappointment. These are more important than talent. In risky sports, you need mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times but kept trying until he succeeded.
Not everyone thinks Tony is a hero. Some say he takes too many risks. Tony says these people do not understand his sport. He gets advice from experts to stay safe. Tony is careful about risks. He says, 'Some people never get scared, but they should be aware of dangers. I feel fear but find a way past it. I am not addicted to risk and plan a lot. I must not lose my nerve before a jump. If I commit fully, I am fine.'"
56,B1,"'Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She ran a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long, thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she knew some circus skills, she found high-wire walking very different. ‘The training was a surprise,’ said Helen. ‘I didn’t know how strong I needed to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then I did an hour of exercises, and another hour after practicing on the wire. I also learned how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!’ On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ‘That was the scariest thing I’ve done,’ she said afterwards. ‘I’m glad it’s over!’ But Helen is still planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.'"

Before this, he wrote a book about traveling around Canada in a 50-year-old car. Jeff loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, he rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a normal bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 because of a knee injury, he finally left in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘I met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which I couldn’t do, but I never regretted my penny farthing. The further from home I got, the more amazed people were by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. He got very sick and stayed in bed for ten days without medicine. He had no money for hospital bills or to go home. Despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would travel again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"

This tool helps us see the ducks at night. We are worried about black ducks because their numbers have gone down a lot. We are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night. We did not have the right equipment before. But now, with this new scope, we can see clearly even on nights without moonlight. This will help us learn more and take better care of the places where they live. The work is hard. There are four of us, and each person works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places. I have to take a boat to some places and write notes about every duck I see. The weather is not always good. Some nights are mild, but often it is wet. It is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. I like the challenge, especially compared to the summer. In the summer, we will spend hours in a lab looking at our results. It will be hard to stay inside, but it is important.

Tasting chocolate is important to make sure customers get perfect chocolate bars from my company. Every week, I get small samples from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products I make. I give my colleagues samples, and they are happy! My kitchen has many machines and ingredients to use. It’s great to have a private space to go to during the day. Every day is different in this job. Sometimes I am at our food lab, and other times I travel to buy our raw materials. This can be hard because I have a young family. But I love the variety and not having a routine.

60,B1,"'Have you ever thought about what it’s like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. Her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see how they are doing. Sophia says, “For a circus career, performers need to do different things – it’s important to keep performances exciting. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great thing is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get hurt, or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is planning for the future because you can only travel while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many past students start businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a job for making money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!”'"

People like Mariam are important in the music industry! ‘What I love about my job is that when I go into the recording studio, I never know what I’ll sing,’ she says. ‘It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little song for a radio station or an advertisement. I’m often surprised by what producers ask. I was once asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue, I just do the job!’ ‘Excellent musical skills are important for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There’s often no written music to look at. I’ll never forget my first time recording background music for a film. It was very hard because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra too. I was scared: I knew that if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough already.’ ‘One of my favorite jobs is recording for songwriters. Less experienced writers don’t always know which musical range is best for the female voice.

These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are chosen by many celebrities. Before choosing satchels, Julie made a list of different businesses, like cake decorating and party planning, to think about her options. Once she decided, not everyone agreed with her. Julie says, 'Many said there was no demand for them – but I was sure.' She worked with her family from the start, including her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design came from children's storybooks. Although Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they have been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and hoped they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest has continued to grow, as has the speed her company makes the satchels. Julie now loves waiting to see which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community for ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when a company copied Julie's design to sell similar products, so now she makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors say there is a positive feeling in her offices – people love working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it is the team who make it a special place.'"

She was a good swimmer, and the coach at her swimming club thought she could become a champion. But the club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to train and do her schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started joining competitions. Vicky thought it looked very exciting and decided to try it too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was near her school, so she could go to training after school every day. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won many competitions. Then, when she was 28, she stopped competitive cycling. Vicky said: ‘For years I loved winning competitions, but I started to get tired of it – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together so they’re part of a bigger group.’ The charity uses famous people to advertise their work. Vicky says, ‘I know some people aren’t sure if having a celebrity is always good for a charity. They say the celebrities only do it to promote themselves, which stops people from seeing the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’'"

The first time Ana sang in front of people was at school. She was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to become more confident. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in three days. She liked it so much that she took a songwriting course. Even though she was the youngest, she knew more about music than many others. But Ana felt the teacher did not listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about it. She put this song online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the words. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, came to ask her to join Isotope. At first, she was unsure because she did not know the company and did not want to be told what to sing. But Joss convinced her, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a great evening. Ana says she likes writing songs about difficult times because there is more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him sad. She hopes fans like her songs, but her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her.'"
65,B1,"'Last year, I went on a great trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He is a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I do not. I wanted to visit the area because I saw it on TV as a child. I also knew our great-grandparents lived there before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go too, and he finally said yes! A few days before we left, there were storms in the area. But the weather forecast said it would be calm when we were there. I was busy at work and did not have much time to think about the trip. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying. After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our things into small boats, and set off. The guide said very few people lived along that coast. On the first morning, we only saw dolphins and birds. There were islands far away, but the morning fog made it hard to see them. I looked at the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t know. It was nice not to worry about time. We always made lunch and dinner together over campfires. When we fell asleep on the boats each night, even though the beds were hard, it felt stress-free! When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I go back to normal life? But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!'"
66,B1,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think I would love basketball because of this, but I didn't. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I often took a book to read instead of watching the games. 
When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager, but I was already two meters tall. My sports teacher saw my height and asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. I enjoyed the training, but I thought I needed to get better before playing a real game. The teacher believed in me more than I did. After a few weeks, I played my first game against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it went well in the end!
For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was great to work with him. But I didn't like being far from my parents at first. At home, I didn't have much time with friends because of training, so that part didn't change much. I got used to my new life, and my English got better quickly!
I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after moving to the USA. I was taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to fix that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,B1,"'Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I thought about different jobs and decided to become a weekend tour guide in my city, Chicago, USA. I took visitors around the city and was surprised by how much I liked it. I saw my city in a new way, like the tourists did. After I finished my studies, I wanted to be a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be easy, but I learned I needed to know a lot more. In Chicago, guides must answer many questions about the city, like its buildings, history, and transport. After some hard but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and became an independent tour guide. Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping the group together. You need other skills too. You should be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You also need to handle changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a good tour, not hear about problems. I make sure visitors are happy, so they don't write bad reviews online. Good reviews bring more customers. I try to make my tours fun and stress-free. I put a lot of energy into my job, so my reviews are usually very good, and people often recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago.'"
68,B1,"My name is Ella and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along well. We went to help as volunteers at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was not sure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was the first time we did something like this. In the end, we did not need to worry. One of our main jobs at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it very hard work, but I thought it was worth it to see the elephants enjoy their meal. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even if I got wetter than the elephants! My favorite part of the day was the evening. We walked with the elephants into the forest where they stayed at night. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we did not have much space. We chose this because Josie did not want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and did not have meat, which we do not like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff talked and played games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie does not talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I am not sure she is being honest. I think she is a bit upset because she missed her friends too much and did not enjoy her time there fully. But when she thinks about it, she knows she was lucky to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I definitely will!"
69,B1,"'I’m Gina D’Costa and I have a flower shop in the UK. We sell flowers to many different people. Hotels and offices often want flowers for their Reception. Sometimes, we help with photo sessions for businesses by giving flowers for their advertising pictures. Once, I decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of it. My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still sleeping then, and my friends think I am crazy, but I love my job. It is often cold and dark, but I don’t mind. The flower market is wonderful, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I was choosing for myself, I’d only get pink ones because it’s my favourite colour. But I must remember that what I love and what other people want are not always the same. Not all flowers are available all year. I don’t like arguing about prices with the flower-sellers, but it is part of the job. Flowers are not cheap, so I try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and put flowers in vases. Then we make bunches of flowers and work out how much they will cost. Customers are often surprised by the price, and I sometimes have to ask them to choose again. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I like making the nicest flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That’s what you have to do when you’re selling things – I wouldn’t want any other job!'"
70,B1,"'My city has a modern cinema that shows all the new films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It is close to where I live. But a year ago, I felt something was missing – talking about a film with a group of people after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, and this made the perfect feeling for the film, which was great! Some places we use are free because the owners sell snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We are happy to make enough money to cover our costs – we are not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets easier for us, especially now we have our own good equipment. We also know how many tickets we have sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There is still a lot to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say they had a great time, it is wonderful. The website has been a big help, and we are now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We have visited to see how people do things in different places – but it is always nice to come back to our own club! We have started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, instead of reading reviews in local papers. We have also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing is as successful as word of mouth, though – people telling their friends about us. And the audience loves the special activities we do with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed.'"
71,B1,"'When I was a child, I loved taking photos. At 15, I wanted to do something special with my hobby. I decided to take one photo every day for a year. Many young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to make a photo diary and show my photos to others. I was happy to see that people liked my photos. I enjoyed taking photos of many things. Then someone said my project would be better if all my photos had a common idea. I agreed and started taking photos of nature, like birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different because other young photographers took color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost stopped. But I trusted myself and became more confident. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered my photos for fun. I was so happy when the judges said I won first prize. It was the first time I thought my photography was good, and maybe I could be a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio and I am happy with my career choice.'"
72,B1,"'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and adult volunteers called ‘leaders’ run them. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organise activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was shy, and the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. I decided to try the challenge because I wanted my first NYC certificate. Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me keep volunteering at the club because I had made good relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to going. Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a youth worker – someone who works with children. I never thought about this before starting at the club. I had never thought about my future job, and the idea of youth work was new to me. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I have several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!'"
73,B1,"I was born in Denver, USA. I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort, two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, and my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was young and had not thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy. In the end, I did well. After this, I quickly started to love snowboarding and got better at it. I began competing when I was ten. Some people do many competitions and get bored, but I love competing and winning. This makes me try harder. I like not having a fixed plan. Once, I became the first woman to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I would try the jumps that got me this score until I started. This made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and studying because there is no snow. I train every day, but I don’t have to follow a strict diet like in winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. This helps me when I can’t do what I love, which is snowboarding. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I need something else to do if I don’t become a professional snowboarder or if I get hurt. I am thinking about becoming a doctor if I have time for college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I can’t snowboard my whole life."
74,B1,"'When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had. I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday. I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it if I paid for it myself. So, I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a lot from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn't like it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try. I thought it was hard, but it was easier than I expected. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they liked them, but I thought they were just being nice. To see if others liked them, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery to take home. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just my mum and me! Then I knew it could work, so I made a website. Now, I make a lot of money online, but we still have our stall. It has been a lot of fun.'"
75,B1,"'When Janine Stuart was only 13, she wrote a book called Being Amelia. It became very popular. Being Amelia is partly about Janine’s life. In one interview, Janine said, ‘Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, starts at a new school. Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. I’m my parents’ only child, so I had to imagine that.’ Janine started her book one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers always told her to write, so it seemed like a good way for Janine to spend her time. The year before, she entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people there wanted to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s book was in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia says that even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the people in the story have some hard times, and this makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a very long book, she’s shown that she’s a better writer than some other popular authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ‘At first, I hid when people recognised me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!’'"
76,B1,"'I’m Tom, I’m fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! It all started when my father got a job as the castle’s manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and keeps them open for people to visit. He was happy because he thought he wouldn’t get such a great chance again, but it took some time for us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our nice home across the water, and there was no school. After we moved, we quickly got used to life on the island. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island is busy in summer because many people visit, and there are often parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren’t as many teenagers as I hoped. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which is often hard work. The biggest change for me was taking a boat every day to my old school. I was excited to go on stormy days with big waves – but the boats don’t go then! And I found out that if I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last boat home, which is worrying. So when friends come home with me, I always tell them to hurry up! But we often see amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it’s so foggy that you can’t see anything, then a few hours later it’s sunny again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get bad storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to not get damaged. But then I remind myself it’s been here for hundreds of years – and it’s still standing!'"
77,B1,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I love nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby – birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural home. I spent hours watching them with my parents. They showed me how to tell different birds apart and where to find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After we came home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species. I’m almost there because on family holidays abroad, I’ve seen birds from other countries too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America. I thought I’d see my 200th bird species there. I wasn’t too sad when it didn’t happen because I’ve learned you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge. Many teenagers liked it and said it looked like a fun hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I wasn’t nervous until just before I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over. The teachers said I’d prepared well and they really enjoyed it. I might do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,B1,"'I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. But my family knew I often liked new hobbies and then stopped them, so they thought I would do the same with football. But I didn’t stop. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. And the chance came sooner than I thought. I often played in local games, and one of the referees saw that I was a good player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she asked me to join her club. I didn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager liked me, and I started training with a big club when I was 13 years old. After that, I got much better. Even so, people still weren’t sure I’d be a star player, which made me a bit sad. But the coach told me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s important matches, much earlier than I thought! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by luck, I scored the winning goal. Even with the big crowd, I could hear my coach’s voice cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the field. Fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The goal is to get teenagers interested in football and to let them talk to other players in my club. It will show them the professional environment and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team if they work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few bad times, though – so I’ve been lucky!'"
79,C2,"'In the UK and around the world, schools and universities are now encouraging students to start doing research early in their studies. Research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It is a way to learn and build skills. Research skills are useful in school and at work because they help us think about the world and do our jobs better. As a student, you help create knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat it; you make it. Making knowledge means asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if this were different? These questions are part of what we call research. Research can be very complex and done by experts, but it can also be simple and part of everyday life. For example, when you plan a holiday, fix things at home, or choose what to buy online, you are doing research. In college, you need to have an enquiring mind, find problems and questions, and think critically about what you read or hear. In some places, people think knowledge is already known, and you learn by listening to teachers. But in the UK, US, and many other places, students are expected to question what they learn. This can be challenging, but it is important. Critical thinking is key in research. We need to think about what we read, test it, and see if it makes sense. We should not just accept everything as true without thinking about it.'"
80,C2,"Cities have always been places where people think and create new ideas. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In Paris, artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art in cafés. But living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso moved to the countryside later. Cities are full of creativity, but they can also be stressful and unnatural.
Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains. They found that city life can make us tired and think less clearly. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies show that hospital patients get better faster when they can see trees. Even a small view of nature helps our brains because it gives us a break from city life.
More people now live in cities than ever before. We are in crowded places with many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Walking in a busy city street, our brain has to pay attention to many things: people, traffic, and the city layout. This takes a lot of energy because the brain has to decide what to focus on.
Nature, on the other hand, is easier for our brains. This idea is called attention restoration theory. It says that being in nature helps our brains relax and recover. Natural places catch our attention without making us feel stressed, unlike loud city noises. Parks like Central Park in New York give people a break from city life and help the brain work better.
People have tried many ways to improve thinking, like energy drinks or changing office designs. But simply walking in nature seems to work best. Despite the problems of city life, cities keep growing. They are still places where people come up with new ideas. Research shows that the busy city life that tires us also helps us be creative. The many social interactions in cities lead to new ideas and innovations.
The challenge is to reduce the stress of city life while keeping its benefits. Because sometimes, people still want to say, ""I'm tired of nature, take me to the city!"""
81,C2,"'Where is the mind? This might seem like a strange question. We usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have special machines that can show this. But I believe we should not only study the mind inside the head. There is a lot of evidence, from long ago to now, that things around us also help us think. For example, in archaeology, we see that stone tools, jewelry, carvings, clay tokens, and writing systems are important for human evolution and the mind. So, maybe what is outside the head is also part of the mind. 
We often think the mind and brain are the same because we study people without the things around them. This is useful for scientists who study the brain. But it makes us forget that much thinking happens outside our heads. I do not deny that the brain is important for thinking, but I suggest that the mind is more than just the brain. Human intelligence might spread into culture and the material world. This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how things become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers from clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also studies how this has changed over time and what it means for our thinking.
Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The stick and the person work together, showing that the mind and things are connected. The stick helps the blind person feel the world, and the brain treats the stick as part of the body. This shows that human intelligence can change by using new tools. My idea is that the human mind is always changing and evolving. The 'stick' can be anything from old stone tools to the internet. It helps us understand and explore the world. Humans use 'sticks' to learn and know more. This is why humans make things, and these things help shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds change as they interact with the world. MET helps us understand how different tools, from old axes to smartphones, change who we are and how we think. Technology has always changed our minds, even from the beginning of human history.'"
82,C1,"Photography is one of the most important inventions in history. It changed how we see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of culture. It was used in many areas like science, industry, art, and entertainment. Historians say photography is one of the greatest contributions of the US to the visual arts. 
Photography started in the mid-19th century. Why did people like it so much? First, photography was a new technology. People in the US liked new technology and change. Just like trains and electricity made the world smaller, photography brought images of the world into people's homes. Second, people used cameras to show who they were. In the US, people often changed their personal and national identities. Third, cameras helped families keep memories. Photos gave families a way to remember their past, even if the photos were a bit idealized. Lastly, photos looked real and showed everyday life, which was important in US art.
A photograph shows what the photographer wants us to see. It is a record of what was in front of the camera. This makes photos seem objective, or real. But because a person takes the photo, it also shows their point of view. People often think photos are a 'universal language' because they show things we recognize. But understanding a photo can be complex. We need to know why the photo was taken and how people first saw it. The same photo can mean different things in different places and times.
In the past, artists did not talk much about using cameras. But now, many artists use photos in their work. For example, US artist Andy Warhol used photos in his art. Today, photography is an important part of art, just like painting."
83,C1,"'In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and doctor, called psychology the 'science of mental life.' This is still a good way to start understanding psychology today. We all have thoughts and feelings, so we have some idea of what mental life means. Psychology can be studied in animals like rats and monkeys, but it is mostly about humans. James thought human psychology had basic parts: thoughts and feelings, the world around us, and how we know about these things. Our knowledge is personal and comes from our own thoughts and experiences. Sometimes, we think we know why people act a certain way, like feeling unhappy or quitting a job. But people can see things differently. Psychology tries to find out which explanations are correct. Psychologists help us tell the difference between our own ideas and scientific facts. They study the mind and brain, but they do not know everything about how the brain works. So, they learn by watching how people behave and making guesses about what happens inside us. Studying psychology is hard because we cannot see the mind like we can see an engine. We can only guess what is happening by looking at behavior. Psychology is like solving a puzzle. It uses careful observation and logical thinking. Psychology wants to describe, understand, predict, and change behavior. It helps us in many areas, like teaching children to read, making machines safer, and helping people talk about their feelings. People have talked about psychological questions for a long time, but they have only studied them scientifically for about 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, which means looking at their own thoughts, to find answers. But this method has limits. William James said trying to understand the mind this way is like trying to see darkness by turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to study the behavior of others instead of just thinking about their own experiences.'"
84,C1,"'In a simple building in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows products that people did not want to buy. The museum is owned by a company called GfK. Carol Sherry, who runs the museum, thinks each product has a sad story. The museum is surprising because it makes money. Many companies do not keep their failed products, so they visit this museum to learn. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, who worked in marketing, began collecting new products in the 1960s. He did not plan to collect failed products, but most products do not succeed. This is why the museum has many unsuccessful items. People often think positively, which can lead to products failing. Marketers might spend more money on a bad product to try to sell it. People do not like to talk about failure. In the self-help world, people believe that thinking positively can make good things happen. Tali Sharot, a neuroscientist, says that people often think things will go better than they do. Gabriele Oettingen, a psychologist, found that thinking too much about success can make people less motivated. Carol Dweck, another psychologist, says that people have different beliefs about ability. Some think ability is natural, while others think it can grow with effort. People who believe in natural ability find failure hard. Those who believe in effort see failure as a chance to improve. Dweck says that seeing failure as a way to grow is a happier way to live.'"
85,C1,"'Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But do we know why? Many people think they do; it seems clear. But professional sports are changing fast, and what we thought was true is now being questioned. Two main reasons are science and money. Sports scientists want to know what makes players do their best, and they have many ideas about home advantage. Meanwhile, people who invest money in sports want to know why home advantage matters. If players are paid well, shouldn't they play well anywhere? What about the fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach fans there? It would matter to British fans, who think their team needs their support. Fans often believe that when they cheer, their team scores. But they forget the times when cheering didn't lead to a goal. However, one thing fans believe is true. Home fans often try to influence the referee. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This matched the real decisions made during the game. The study showed that referees avoid making calls that would upset the home crowd. Recent studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s in England, home teams won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be hard, but now players travel in comfort. Stadiums are also more similar now. But these changes happened recently. The mystery is why home advantage is different in each sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football. Baseball has the least. One reason might be that home advantage is about teamwork, and baseball is more about individual players. In basketball, winning depends on teamwork, which is stronger at home. Another reason could be players' testosterone levels. They are higher before home games, which might be a natural urge to defend their home. In the Rugby World Cup, some home teams won against stronger teams, showing home advantage. As one referee said, 'It’s the law of the jungle out there.'"
86,C1,"""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports. Many athletes and coaches like it. The saying means that practice makes you better, not luckier. This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate. This debate asks if talent is something you are born with or something you learn. Many people think practice is more important than natural talent. Psychologist Anders Ericsson said that you need 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. This idea is in books like Outliers and Talent Is Overrated. These books say practice is the most important thing. But, in his book, Epstein says this is not always true. He looks at why some people are very good at what they do. He travels to places like Kenya and Sweden to find answers. In Alaska, he learns that sled dogs’ success might be because of their genes and their desire to run. This suggests that drive might also be genetic. Epstein talks about nature (genes) and nurture (practice). He says both are important for top athletes. He thinks if Usain Bolt grew up in the US, he might have been a good basketball player. Epstein also talks about race and gender. He asks why men and women compete separately if practice is all that matters. Sometimes, the simplest questions are the best."""
87,C1,"'A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks: why are children today so unhappy? In her new book, Kith, Griffiths explains that children spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers. They have lost contact with nature – the woods, mountains, rivers, and streams. This, she says, is the main problem. A study talked to children and found that many would be happier if they could play outside more. Many adults over 40 remember their childhood as free and fun, playing outside all day. They think this was better and healthier than how children live now. But these adults are the ones who keep their children inside because they worry about safety. Griffiths' book talks about how fear of danger keeps kids at home, which helps the toy and gadget industry sell more products. She also talks about giving medicine to restless children or making them wear goggles for games. Griffiths is upset about these things and writes passionately about them. However, she sometimes goes too far with her ideas. She even compares how children are treated today to racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths is very romantic about children. She thinks children are naturally good and creative, but this might not be true for all kids. The book's main idea is that children should have freedom to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes children learn to handle danger by having small accidents. But she doesn't say how to make sure these accidents are small. Also, not all children want to be adventurous. Some are shy and prefer to stay home. Maybe the real problem is forcing all children to be the same, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside.'"
88,C1,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have studied a lot. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of school. Most life problems cannot be solved with formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgement, wisdom, and creativity from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My research focuses on the value of play for children's development. All young mammals, including humans, play. Those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because they rely more on learning than instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always learned. Important skills for a happy, productive life cannot be taught in school. They are learned through play. These skills include creativity, getting along with others, and controlling emotions. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. Creative thinking is important. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses keep their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he got it back after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play'. He imagined chasing a sunbeam to develop his theory of relativity. We cannot teach creativity, but we can discourage it with schooling that focuses on set questions and answers. More important than creativity is getting along with others and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and this helps them learn social skills and fairness. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit. If you cannot quit, it is not play. To keep playing, everyone must be happy. This makes play democratic. School has become harder: less break time, more homework, and more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-led sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised play. Adults now feel they must solve children's problems. These changes have been slow but big. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, expert warnings, less community, and the belief that children learn more from adults than each other. Our children need more play, not more school. We must give childhood back to children. They need to play and explore to grow into strong adults for the future."
89,C1,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them talk directly to employers. This is different from the past when people had to stand outside offices with signs saying ""hire me."" But using social media can also lead to mistakes. 
For example, a young person in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. He wanted her to share her list of important contacts to help him get a job. The executive was not happy with this request. She refused and sent a very sarcastic reply, which many people saw online. People were shocked by her response, and she might regret how she said it. However, this situation teaches young people to be careful when using social media for work. Social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly.
Many young people have used social media like Facebook and Twitter for fun for years. It was a place to impress others and try new things. But using social media for work is different. Some young people do not see the difference. They think being bold and confident online will help them get jobs. But employers want something else. They want young people to be polite and professional.
Employers often say young job seekers are too familiar and seem arrogant. This makes older people think young people feel entitled. But many young people are just trying hard to find jobs. They have the skills and energy to be good workers, but their way of communicating can hurt their chances.
So, how should you contact someone on a professional site? First, say who you are and what you can offer them, like doing research or helping in some way. This gives you a better chance of getting a good reply. Do not send the same message to everyone, and be polite. Social media can help you make good contacts, but you need to use it carefully."
90,C1,"'It is hard to say what will happen to newspapers in the future. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the number of people buying UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to a half. In the USA, only 26% of people say newspapers are their main news source, down from 45% in 2001. Some people think printed newspapers will disappear in 15 years. But old media often survive. In 1835, a journalist said books and theatre were finished, but they are still here. Theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and TV. Radio is still popular even with TV, and cinema is still here despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records are selling again, with sales up 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too. They became popular in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. People started to want regular news updates. In medieval times, people did not expect change. They only noticed the seasons and big events like famine or disease. Journalism as a job started in the 19th century. People did not always need news every day or week. Newspapers have a fixed format, but online news is different. Online, you can choose what news you want and get updates quickly. Mistakes can be fixed fast, and there is no limit on space for stories. But online news often focuses on being first and getting comments, not on understanding. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors. We might be going back to that. Newspapers have not always explained the world well. They might disappear, or they might help us understand our chaotic world.'"
91,C1,"'If humans were comfortable in the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness like many animals that are active at night. But we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This is a basic part of who we are, even if we don't often think about it. This is why we have changed the night by adding light to it. We have filled the night with light, like building a dam in a river. This has benefits but also problems, called light pollution. Light pollution happens because of bad lighting design, which lets light shine into the sky instead of down to the ground. This extra light changes the night and affects many living things, including us. It can change how animals migrate, reproduce, and feed. In the past, the idea of 'light pollution' would not make sense. Imagine walking to London on a moonlit night around 1800. It was the biggest city in the world, with nearly a million people. They used candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no streetlights yet. From far away, you would smell London before you saw its light. We have lit up the night as if it was empty, but many animals are active at night. Light is very powerful and attracts many animals. Birds can be drawn to bright lights and fly around them until they are exhausted. Some birds sing at night because of artificial light. People once thought light pollution only bothered astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. Most of us don't need a clear night sky for work, but we do need darkness. Darkness is important for our health, just like light. Changing our natural sleep patterns can cause health problems. Our sleep and wake cycles are linked to the Earth's light and dark cycles. Changing these rhythms is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are affected by light pollution too. We live in bright light and lose our connection to the stars and the natural day and night cycle. Light pollution makes us forget our place in the universe, which we can best understand by looking at the night sky with the Milky Way above us.'"
92,C1,"The founder of a big company said his company will not count employees' paid holiday time anymore. This idea came from an internet company that did the same thing. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which was shared in newspapers. The email seemed like it was written by someone from his media team. 
The question is: is this idea practical? The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service. The big company has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want if it doesn't hurt the business"" might work better in a smaller company. In a big company, it is harder to know if your absence will hurt the business.
The founder said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work is up to date and their absence won't hurt the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? Work piles up when you are on holiday. This can make employees feel guilty about taking time off, leading to stress and less productivity.
There might also be pressure from coworkers about who takes time off and for how long. In many companies, people work late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture. Without a set amount of leave, people might feel they can't take time off because they don't want to seem lazy. 
Modern technology blurs the line between work and free time. The internet company started the unlimited leave policy because employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If work hours are not tracked, why should time off be tracked differently? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Employees might feel they are always being watched, which can be stressful.
Employment laws give workers a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for health. The benefits of the unlimited leave policy, like more creativity and productivity, can happen without harming worker well-being. So, it is doubtful if ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or result of this policy."
93,C1,"'Journal-based peer review is when experts check a scientific paper before it is published. This process is important to make sure the research is good. It can take up to a year to review a paper. Some people think this is too long, but it helps make sure the research is trustworthy. 
However, things are changing in scientific publishing. Preprints are becoming more popular. Preprints are drafts of papers shared online before they are reviewed. They help share new research quickly so others can read and discuss it. Publishing in journals is often about gaining fame and advancing careers, which can lead to problems. Scientists might leave out important data to get published in top journals. Reviewers sometimes focus more on whether a paper is interesting rather than if it is good science.
Preprints can help solve these problems. They allow for open discussion and feedback from many people. Some scientists worry that preprints might lead to bad science being shared, but this has not happened yet. Preprints let authors get feedback from a global community. For example, Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, used a preprint to share her critique of another paper. This way, everyone could see the discussion and decide for themselves.
Preprints also help share negative results, which are important but often ignored by journals. They make papers more visible and increase how often they are read and cited. Preprints focus on the research itself, not just where it is published.'"
94,C1,"'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say it is like ‘a painting in words’. Their answers usually do not satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist, and another from the point of view of the object itself, called ‘Poem.’ Here’s what one student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe. I am used only in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me. The item? An oxygen mask – a surprising choice that helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise was fun and led to good discussions. When I was in school, poetry was confusing to me. I thought every poem was a difficult puzzle that stopped me from understanding and feeling. After school, most people read poetry less and less. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like normal writing. It almost dares you to read it, and often you feel let down because it seems plain or hard to understand. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we want from poems? Aren’t they supposed to have deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever humor? The answer might be yes. But for tears, we watch movies; for information, we read articles. Novels let us escape to other worlds, paintings are nice to look at, and music – well, it combines words, instruments, and melody beautifully. But a poem can show us something else: ambiguity. Life is full of it, just like poems. But this still doesn’t tell us what a poem really is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it takes you to ‘poetry’: ‘a form of art using the beauty and rhythm of language.’ This is what professors say, but the word’s roots tell us more. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek word poí?ma, meaning ‘a thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes say poems are like wild animals – untameable and unpredictable – or like machines – carefully made and precise. But these comparisons don’t always work. The best part of comparing poems is the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this can change how you think about machines or animals. It helps us see things in a new way. Poems can stick in our minds, like song lyrics. Words and music together are powerful, like schoolyard rhymes. But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem in a newspaper or magazine: A poem can have a strong impact, even though it is just ink on paper like the prose around it. What about the empty space around the poem – space that could be used for a longer article or ad? A poem is written and rewritten like an article or story, but it is not made to be sold. Publishers send out poetry books, but few expect them to make money. A poem is not for the market, but for itself. Because it is special – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem can still surprise us, even if just for a moment.'"
95,B2,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I have found many brooches and coins, and each one makes me happy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion. 
One dull February afternoon, I had some free time and wanted to go to a place I knew. But it was raining, so I went to a closer spot with mostly old farming tools. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I almost ignored it but decided to check. I dug half a metre down and was lying in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I thought it might be brass, like curtain rails I found before, so I didn't get too excited. But as I cleaned it, I saw it was a beautiful, patterned loop. I stopped and stared. I remembered seeing something like it in the British Museum. It was a torc, a necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. 
I took it to my car and drove home, looking at the torc on the seat next to me. I washed it in my kitchen sink. ‘Marion!’ I called, ‘I've got something for you.’ She came in and stopped when she saw it. ‘What is it?’ she asked. I told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewellery. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. I was worried about it, so I got up and hid it under a floorboard in my office. 
The law says you must report such finds within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc before giving it up. I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was checked and sold to my local council. It is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 from the sale was split between the field's owner and me. But the torc is more than just money. It's something I saved for the nation. People ask if I will stop detecting now that I found something so amazing. But I still find brooches and coins interesting. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing. He hopes to catch an even bigger fish tomorrow."
96,B2,"'Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When friends tell me about their busy trips, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for naps in the afternoon and lazy mornings in bed? Better sleep is a nice part of traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept – more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Far from home, I could sleep deeply and have many dreams. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes easier. I think sleep is part of the travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we see, hear, and smell new things. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. We process all this while we sleep, which makes travel sleep more intense. Sleep also changes with different places. People talk about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local habits is harder. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. When I finally do, I feel like I have truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, we all took naps on hammocks and sofas. I understood why they had so many pillows. I joined them and experienced the siesta, a traditional nap. Travel sleep is special because I remember it. Away from my normal routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds while I sleep. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every moment instead of rushing, then sleep is the slowest activity. Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too.'"
97,B2,"'The woman turned away from the mirror. ‘What do you think? And be honest.’ Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a pretty layer of gauze and a silk bow. ‘I still think this one looks best on you,’ she said kindly to her customer. The woman wrinkled her nose and made a face. ‘But it is so boring,’ she said. ‘Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little hat will make me stand out.’ She touched the red and black small top hat on her head. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘this is the one I want.’ Mia smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen’s thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family party. Mia was happy to see Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious to meet Jen’s friend. Jen had called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ‘Tattie,’ Jeff, Mia’s husband, had said, ‘What sort of name is that?’ ‘It’s short for Tatiana,’ Mia replied. ‘I think it’s nice.’ Jeff didn’t like fancy things or people who pretend to be something they are not. He also didn’t like when Mia didn’t say what she really thought. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a trash can lid would look better on her. ‘The trouble with you, Mia,’ he often said, ‘is that you’re too polite.’ An hour later, Mia closed the shop and went home. Her shop was next to her house, so it only took forty seconds to get there. Four years ago, when their youngest child, Luke, left home, Mia had the idea to turn the barn next to their house into a shop. Jeff was unsure. ‘Do you really think people want hats?’ he asked. Mia knew they did because her friends often said it was hard to find the perfect hat for a special occasion. She was right. From the first day, after Jen helped her make a website, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her shop in the village of Little Pelham. In a friendly place, they could try on many hats to find the right one. Mia also had changing rooms and told her customers to bring their clothes so they could match everything. She recently started selling handbags and costume jewelry too.'"

Now, he might join a big American football team, even though he has never played before. In Atlanta, he is learning his new position in the team. It seems surprising that a 21-year-old from London could be chosen for a top American team. But Lawrence is used to surprising people. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but decided to focus on discus. In just 20 months, he became the fourth-best discus thrower in the world. Lawrence went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus. He wanted to get ready for the world championships. He thought about American football before, but it seemed crazy. When he arrived in the USA, he decided to try it. He read about NFL trials in Atlanta and applied, even though he had never played. Was he nervous? 'No,' he says. 'I don’t get nervous for many things.' Lawrence did very well in the tests and was the most impressive player. He was happy to hear that. But he knows he has a lot to learn. How can he join an NFL team with no experience? 'Coaches say I have what it takes. It’s about how hard I work,' he says. Is he worried about being selected? 'No, there’s no pressure. People say I will be selected, but I’m not worried.' Lawrence had a tough time at the Olympics when he came last in the final. But he is happy he made it to the final. 'That was an amazing day,' he says. 'The final didn’t go as I wanted, but that’s sport.' After the Olympics, some people thought he was affected by the loss. Lawrence doesn’t talk about it. NFL players earn a lot of money, over $400,000 a year. Lawrence has changed from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Should he focus on one sport? 'I understand why people say that,' he says. 'I’m trying to do something I dreamed about as a schoolkid. If it doesn’t work, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I’ve made has been planned.'"
99,B2,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty land below. The dark brown and green colors made me feel better. It was mid-September, but it had not started snowing in Siberia yet. I saw no signs of people, just mountains, streams, and forests going on forever. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said in a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow. He was flying to sell safety clothing to the local mining industries. His English was almost as bad as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I told him I was flying to Magadan in far-eastern Siberia with a one-way ticket. I wanted to return home to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unsure and said ""Holodna"" (cold) while pointing outside. I tried to show him with hand gestures that I had warm clothes, but I did not tell him that I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment were bought at low prices. I was not sure they would work well, especially my big postman’s over-trousers which I bought for £10. It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall was full of students. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer kept talking. I was thinking about a question. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I wrote a note, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In front of me was Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He read it, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I opened it and read, ""OK."" Six years later, I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher. The job was challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and had long holidays for adventures. Twice since I started teaching, I met Al. He loved adventures after our bike ride through Pakistan and decided to cycle around the world. Since that first ride, Al set himself bigger challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was his biggest. Sometimes he thought the ride or the road would break him. It sounded tough, but I envied him. He was having an amazing adventure, finding he could handle each new challenge. He proved wrong those who said he could not do it. He did something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,B2,"In the Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns to fly through tall pylons, which are 15 to 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to see what it feels like to take part. One hour before the flight, I signed two forms. The first said I was healthy, and the second said I would empty my pockets because small things can be dangerous during the flight. I learned I had to try to stay aware of where I was. ""The horizon is your best friend,"" they told me. ""The pilot will tell you where to look."" I also promised to relax and enjoy the view when flying upside down. Thirty minutes before the flight, I had a safety talk. They told me not to touch anything. When we were moving on the runway, my legs were up, and I tried not to touch the steering pedals or switches. I decided I would not relax and enjoy the flight. In high-speed flying, you must stay calm and focused. You need to tense and relax at the right times. Panicking is not good. This did not comfort me as we started moving fast on the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway. We were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the fastest acrobatic planes, ready to go. The plane took off, and two seconds later, we turned sharply to the right. It was a quick, strong move, and I felt the air leave my lungs. I looked at the horizon, tensed up, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I felt 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned left and dived, leaving my stomach high up and my lungs tight. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, flying between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour, but my excitement was cut short by a sharp right turn. We hadn't done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane. My hand shook so much that the plane shook too. Then Dario said something. I asked him to repeat it, but he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ""Are you okay?"" ""Yes."" ""Have you had enough?"" ""No,"" I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane in a full circle. Some people might find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. But I thought it was too much. At the top of the loop, flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ""Relax, relax, look up."" I looked up and saw fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It was ""soft"" compared to what the pilots do in races. To show this, Dario ate sandwiches happily after we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night I dreamed of doing loops again and again."
101,B2,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you have seen polar bears in a nature documentary, it might be filmed by him. He likes the temperature to be -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first love, and he learned about living in cold places. His big chance came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I took the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I knew that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife series. ‘I started at a good time. When I began, not many people had been to the Antarctic. There were people who filmed coral, elephants, and chimpanzees. I became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were waiting to be filmed.’ The camera and communications technology was very simple when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is easier to film today. If you filmed something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can film a lot and look at it right away. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you missed. You filmed less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I know how it feels. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. But he could not tell which birds they were. When Allan got permission to film for a big TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy job. It is a world of polar bears and is very hard to get to. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very hard. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow for 23 days, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We move around to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I see something so quick that I almost miss it. But the camera is on the hole on full zoom and my eye is very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she slides down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he says, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and see the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,B2,"In 2004, Pen Hadow was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies. He had to swim in very cold water and face frostbite and polar bears. Eight months later, he also reached the South Pole. Now, he is back in the Arctic for a new expedition. This time, Pen and two colleagues will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole in three months. They will measure the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and the results will be very important for scientists. This will show what global warming is doing to the ice.
Pen was trained for this job. As a child, he was cared for by a woman who worked for a famous polar explorer. She made him go out in the cold with little clothing. His father loved adventures in the cold, and Pen became very strong. Pen is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps with his polar guide business. Mary says she worries more about him when he is driving because he is thinking about the Arctic. For fun, Mary once raced Pen in a mountain event. She finished an hour before him.
Pen and Mary live in the country with their two children. Pen says it is harder to leave them now. Last time, he told his son to take care of the family, which was too much for him. So, Pen plans to have little contact with them while he is away. He is getting ready for the trip and checking his equipment carefully. Ann Daniels, a top polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, the photographer, will join him. A team of six will fly in supplies.
Pen says being in a team is more stressful for him. He is also worried because he is turning 47 and has not trained enough. He thinks his mission is important for science. Before, reaching the North Pole was a personal goal. Now, scientists will use the data, and more people will learn about the Arctic. Pen believes their skills are now very useful."
103,B2,"I took a year off. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. These activities were great, but I wanted something competitive. I wanted to stay in shape, so I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle’s invitation: ‘Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?’ I love rowing and missed it, but I wasn’t ready to train every day. I talked to my rowing friends about the race, but they weren’t interested. If I entered the race, I would want to win. Would Ben help me win? No. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work. I also had to think about losing money from not working. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete. It’s nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I’d have something new to talk about: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure. One big lesson was to be thankful for the easy life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but it was straightforward. I trained all day, nearly every day, with a set program, doctors, and dieticians. I worried about people’s reactions to me racing with a TV presenter. I was afraid it would look like I just wanted to be on TV. My worries went away during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. But he couldn’t row. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but Ben needed to improve a lot. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,B2,"'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in the north of Finland. I was 26 and wanted a change. I dreamed of cold, quiet places, different from noisy London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They let me work as a husky dog handler for the busy winter season. From December to February, many tourists come for sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow. The rides can last from one hour to five days. Anna and Pasi started with six dogs, but now they have more than 100. They also have a second place called the 'wilderness farm’. It is a simple place with no running water and sometimes no electricity. They said I could join them for three months if I understood the work was hard. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I look at a page with pictures of more than 100 huskies. I need to learn their names, but I feel nervous. I stop looking at the page and look out of the window. People say spring moves north at about 26 km per day, with flowers and leaves opening. But I see winter moving south, and the rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus ride north is what I hoped for. We drive through dark forests with snow-covered trees, stopping sometimes for reindeer. I arrive at the farm after dark. As soon as I enter, I get boots and go outside. 'Do you want to start right away?’ Anna asks. I hear barking, which gets louder as I reach the dogs. Three people are busy with the huskies, getting them ready for sleds. The dogs are very excited and want to run. I can’t hear well to introduce myself, and the others are too busy to talk. I stand nearby and pet a quiet dog. Someone waves at me to get in a sled. A command is given, and we start moving into the dark with only a headlight. November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become a husky guide, but first, Anna asks if I am useful. I don’t know what to say. I have never driven a snowmobile, done woodwork since school, or used an axe. 'Do you have a driving licence?’ someone asks. I nod, feeling better. The basics of dog-sledding are easy to learn: lean into corners, use both feet on the brake to stop, and never let go of the handlebar. But other things are hard. Feeding and giving water to the dogs is difficult in the cold. Water freezes quickly, so we make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, I am tired from pulling sleds and being pulled by excited huskies. But I feel proud. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,B2,"'On that day, Radcliffe ran past the finish line, and the press gathered to talk about her amazing run. Her time was so good that she could compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about a natural treatment, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says she didn't really understand how big her achievement was at the time. She and her team had a motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her team, listening to the radio. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was also there. After 16 kilometres, Radcliffe's agent worried she might not keep up the pace and could drop out. Hartmann was upset by this, but he knew it looked risky to start so fast. With 800m left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometres very fast and sprinted the last part in 2 mins 25 secs. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run quicker than that.’ The race director, Dave Bedford, said he didn't think anyone would beat that time soon. Radcliffe thought she would try again next year, but it didn't happen. After the race, people wondered how she beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with her for weeks, helping her with the 250-300 kilometres she ran each week. He said she could handle a lot of pain. Hartmann traveled from Ireland to her training base in France, and her husband would say, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ She was always ready for a two-hour session. Hartmann gave so much time to Radcliffe that other athletes were upset. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has beaten her record? ‘Not really. I trained hard, but others are more talented. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe people race each other more than themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘I never relaxed, even when I was winning. I always pushed hard.’ That marathon was her best race. She never ran as fast again, but she inspired many women to start long-distance running.'"
106,B2,"'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, came out, I didn't know how people would like it. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I thought our show was new and different, but I was worried. Would people like a cooking show that talked about techniques, history, and science? I watched the first show feeling both happy and scared. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to other projects, like a book about my restaurant. Each project felt like a journey into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I wrote several books called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often real, with travel and meeting people. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest book. In it, you travel the world to meet amazing people, like a man who makes the best pasta. These people have spent years trying to make perfect food. Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the show was hard, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was not included. But after a long meeting, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on feelings, memories, and surroundings. I knew the recipes were not 'perfect', but I used my skills and talked to food experts to find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through trying new things. The TV show let me explore new foods, people, and places. I was excited to learn about memory and nostalgia in food because I started my career this way. Finding the best ingredients took me around the world. Some adventures included visiting a tomato factory that used the wrong tomatoes and a dairy farm that was not good enough to film. To perfect each recipe, I did things like hand-milking a cow, using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken in a hospital machine, and almost burning my house down to make a pizza.'"
107,B2,"'We were still far from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field. It stopped moving. John got out and looked at the engine. He stood there for a long time. ‘Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,’ he said, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field was big, with grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I said, because it was always good to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John walk away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’ So I told them about how I heard two birds talking before we left London. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather, and a worm. ‘That’s silly, no one understands bird language,’ Bea said. My eyes hurt. ‘I do.’ But my voice was not strong. ‘Liar.’ I felt bad. How could I be lying if I remembered everything? The more I thought, the less sure I was. ‘Mum…?’ But she was asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind. They waved and smiled at her through the window. We followed John into a café. It was near where our van was parked. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘It might be expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum said, and we sat in the shade. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ‘It’s like syrup,’ she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked at the engine. ‘It’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said when it got dark. Mum put blankets on the ground for us to sleep in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ‘I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,’ John said. Later, we were in a truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John driving. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept thinking about how we’d get home since our van needed to be pulled. I thought it might be easier to take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep.'"
108,B2,"Lucy was at a welcome party in a hotel ballroom. She was talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her. One was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from Europe. Lucy didn't hear the girl's name well because of the noise. It was something like Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy. They spoke English well and talked about the music they were playing and their travels.
Lucy said, ""I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer."" It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She didn't want to do many of the things that took her around the world. She missed so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't wanted to come to the Prague Festival either. Only fifteen pianists in her age group were chosen from around the world, and she was one of them. Her dad bought her a necklace to celebrate, and her little brother Gus dreamed of going to the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music. Lucy hadn't applied to the festival herself. Her mom did it for her. ""I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,"" her mom said. Lucy thought her mom just didn't want her to say no.
The guy from Tokyo asked, ""Tanglewood?"" Lucy said, ""Yeah."" He asked, ""How old are you?"" ""Fifteen,"" she replied. He looked at Liesel/Louisa, who said, ""Wow."" Lucy didn't mean to brag. It was hard to know when she was just sharing or showing off. ""It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're going to try..."" Liesel/Louisa said, ""Excuse me,"" and left. Tokyo stayed and asked, ""Have you ever been to Japan?"" Lucy said, ""Once. When I was, like, eight."" Then Lucy's grandfather came and said, ""Lucy, let me introduce you to someone."" He took her away from the conversation. ""And don't get too friendly with the competition,"" he said. ""They're not the competition,"" Lucy replied. ""Everyone is the competition,"" he said.
Her grandfather took her around the room to talk to important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but she only heard half of what was said. In the elevator after the party, her grandfather said, ""You did well in there, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are."" Lucy liked being somebody, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special at school. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,B2,"""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to go out into the real world,’ said Dad. It’s hard to argue with him, so I wanted to see what experts say. It’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, feel they belong, and are learning important skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is a big part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just use media for things like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do – they live in it. It’s not good or bad – it’s what you do with it that matters.’ How is our social networking like what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like hanging out at the youth club, like today’s parents did when they were young, to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. It helps teenagers find out who they are away from their parents and learn to get along with others. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you find that out: you can post about your favorite music or sports, discover what you like, and see that other people think differently. Research shows that people who use social media a lot are not as self-centered as those who don’t.’ He says social media can help if you’re shy: ‘Talking online can be easier than face-to-face, and you can practice social skills in a safer place.’ Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help if you’re quiet and have special interests because you can find others who like the same things. ‘If only three people in your school like a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a group online with the same interest, you can feel popular in a different way,’ he says. Pauline White, a digital education expert, says: ‘People your age can find new interests online, join groups of people who like the same things, and create their own content. This is using social networks well.’ She thinks social networking is becoming creative: teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about what they like. Photo-sharing sites, she says, are changing creativity. Photographers can connect, learn, share images, and grow their interest. ‘This helps with jobs and will be useful at work,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and get known – and you need to know how it works to get customers. For example, if you make a product and have 1000 friends on social networks, they could be customers. If you connect all those networks, there’s your customer base.’ Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they grow up and start working, agrees Matthews. ‘One great thing about many sites is the chance to work with others to create and share content. Working together is a key skill for the 21st century and important for jobs in the digital age.’"""
110,B2,"'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they don't usually think of a long trip through nine western states in the US and a part of Canada. But my parents wanted something different for our summer vacation this year. My dad planned a big family trip. He and my mom kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" while my twin brother and I looked at each other, thinking, ""There are probably good reasons why!"" In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With just enough space for us in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" We left our big home for smaller places to stay for the next five thousand miles. I wondered what we were getting into. We drove west through Oklahoma. Even close to home, we had adventures. We stopped for the night in Oklahoma under the dark, starry sky, but only after almost being blown off the road by a dust storm. We learned that on the road, cows have the right-of-way! The next day, we got up early and started driving again. I saw a pattern. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to feel the same, but each adventure was different. We walked on the Great Sand Dunes and went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur there showed us what we would experience later. We learned that roads for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw old and new things together. We got used to traffic because of road work. We laughed when we saw the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park. There, we saw the sun set over bear areas near the roads. Traffic stopped for bears crossing, and we had a close encounter with one, which gave us unforgettable memories. As we drove, life at home seemed far away. Even the old hotel we stayed in, with no internet or phone service, didn't make us less excited. It was a 95-year-old building, but the views were amazing. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we drove back south. My parents were right. You don't need to go to a faraway place to find something special. It was nice to be home again, and I didn't fight with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos from our trip to look through. I knew I would remember the unplanned and spontaneous moments.'"
111,B2,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old. She was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school and live at the college. She had a nice room with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone. Jeff and Dahlia would still watch over Amy.
Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. She only remembered a little about her grandmother and never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose’s parents were not very happy, but Daisy insisted. Rose didn’t know why her parents didn’t get along with Daisy, but they had a disagreement years ago. Rose was ten when she last saw her grandmother, but she had happy memories. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked to bring people together. Rose expected dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Daisy was not a typical old lady. She went to many social events.
Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, or go out without asking permission. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new phone for emergencies. Rose was happy. They agreed to trust each other. Daisy would trust Rose to make good decisions, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were problems, they would talk about it.
Rose was not a wild child. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were good. In five weeks, Rose would start a new school, meet new friends, and begin her life again. It was her fourth school in five years, so she was used to it. This was the last time she would change schools, as she would start her final two years. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new part of her life."
112,B2,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to think she might write a novel. Charlotte thought writing a book would be a big achievement because it seemed hard. She didn't know what other teenagers were doing, like being in the Olympics. When she turned 13, she decided to try writing a book. Now, that book is about to be published. Charlotte told her old teacher, who was surprised. The teacher thought Charlotte would write a book when she was 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't understand why she should wait if she could be good at it now.
It's a winter afternoon at Charlotte's publisher's office. I was surprised to see a 15-year-old girl there. Her book is a big achievement: the story is exciting and well-written. Nothing about it, except the age of the main character, shows it was written by a teenager. A public relations person is with us in case Charlotte needs help, but she doesn't. Charlotte is confident and smart, but also calm. She knows she is young and doesn't have all the answers. She says, ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. I don't think my understanding of the world is limited by my age, but I'm not very wise. I wanted to explore the theme of taking responsibility.""
Charlotte thinks teenagers are often shown in three ways in books: as outsiders who become accepted, as naïve and knowing nothing, or as awkward and not socially skilled. She found this annoying. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who aren't inadequate in some way. Some writers make teenagers feel they can't know who they are because they're not experienced enough. This can hurt their self-belief.""
Charlotte loves reading famous fantasy writers, but they almost stopped her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and life. I asked myself: do I have to do this to write a good book?"" She likes a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It says if the reader guesses what will happen, the suspense is gone.""
Some might think Charlotte's parents, who are journalists, helped her get her book published. Her father's friend in publishing helped get her book read. She knows she was lucky because getting a first novel read is hard. ""Every writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talents, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte says."
113,B2,"""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience with ski-jumping, went first. He skied down the slope fast and jumped. His arms were in the air, and something looked wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and fell into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth said, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t ready for freestyle skiing. On other skiing holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it. My parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing centre in the US. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps with fake snow. Students jumped and landed in foam cubes. After practising indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this, ski jumpers just hoped for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat part before the slope goes down again. Land in the right zone, and you keep moving. Land on the flat, and you stop, which hurts. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to go fast towards the jump. My legs slowed down, and I landed on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but I felt shorter by midday. ‘You need to control the jump,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines. I thought I’d hate being inside, but bouncing was fun. Some moves were like ski-jumping, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body does in the air. Gareth talked to us. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work. I only knew what was happening before take-off, then I was in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain. I had more problems before I landed right. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But it didn’t last. On the last run, I didn’t slow down, jumped, and landed well. Then I saw my skis sliding down the slope without me."""
114,B2,"'Imagine you are on a rollercoaster in a theme park. Your hands are sweaty, and you hold on tight as the ride stops and then slowly goes up. There is a pause. Then, the rollercoaster drops quickly, and you feel your stomach lift. You move fast, turn left, and go upside down. You scream because you are scared. But you chose to be there, like many people who visit theme parks every year. Amusement parks are a big business. They have exciting rides to attract people. Many people work to make these rides, like engineers and designers. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' sounds like a child's dream job. But it is hard work. They must make rides fun and safe. They also need to make new things to keep people interested. Most of the ideas used in rollercoasters today were made by John Miller in the early 1900s. Back then, rides were more extreme, but now designers must follow rules. I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts said it is about making people feel excited but safe. Rollercoaster teams create stories, like a space adventure, to make the ride fun. Professor Walker said that experience and trying new things are important. Jeff Hornick, a theme park director, said designers need to love thrills to understand what people want. I asked if new technology like virtual reality will change rollercoasters. Walker said it can add to the ride, but the real rollercoaster experience will still be the most important for a long time.'"
115,B2,"'Miranda Ellington is 25 years old and has done a lot as a choreographer. She makes dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also dances sometimes. She says dancing helps her remember what it feels like to follow orders from choreographers. This can be hard and stressful. As a choreographer, she teaches and likes working with young students. New dancers like to try new ideas and take risks. They want to succeed but do not know their strengths and weaknesses yet. They accept criticism and sometimes give feedback, which Miranda likes.
When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on dance steps and lets the music guide her. Even if she does not like the music, she tries to create the best dance routine. If dancers do not like the music, it can be frustrating, but she has to find solutions. She cannot change the music because it is already chosen for big productions. She wishes she could try different music to make rehearsals better.
Miranda does not want to work with just one theatre or school. She thinks it is important to meet new people and adapt to different styles. This helps her not to become stuck in one way of working.
Miranda talks about a documentary on ballet dancers and choreographers. She says it shows the real life of a dance company. There is a scene where a young dancer gets many corrections, and Miranda understands this. It is hard to watch but true. People do not realize how much work ballet takes.
I ask Miranda what makes a great dance show. She says it is when music, costumes, lighting, and dancers all work well together. Perfection is hard, but aiming high is good. Sometimes, good dance steps are ruined by bad costumes or props.
Miranda has done many types of work. I ask if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She does not like labels and wants to try many things. Maybe one day she will focus on one area, but for now, she wants to explore.'"
116,B1,"'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to experience? This conversation gave me the idea for my four-day trip and a film to make people turn off their TVs. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I put three wheels and some cables on it and used old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Some friends joined me, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I have been on many walking trips in recent years, but this was something new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads. This meant I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while I sit on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest show on TV. You can see the film on my website.'"
117,B1,"'When I read about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port was surprised when I asked for one ferry ticket because the islands are popular with families. I told him I would join ten others to swim around the islands. He still looked confused, but he smiled and showed me to the boat. Our group had sent emails before we started, but there was little time to talk before our first swim. Our guides said a support boat would be with us all the time, and they showed us how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first 1.5 km swim, and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger, and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I wanted to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to finish this first distance, and I was happy when I did it on my own. The next days were the same: jumping in, swimming at a comfortable speed, and stopping to look at the scenery. As the swims got longer, my speed and happiness also grew. We did not need the support boat much. I can’t wait to come again next year.'"

I work with great people, I have a lot of free time, and life is never boring. This makes it a great job for a young person like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school in another country, away from my family. I always flew alone when school started and ended. I felt lonely, so I asked the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers, and some said yes. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for something new. At the interview, there were many young people, and many got the job. They were often very qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I talked about my strengths and past work experience, not just that I loved to travel, because everyone says that. I got the job! I recommend this job to anyone because there are many good things about it. The free flights are not the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying: 'no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.' It feels like a big family. Even though we don’t see each other all the time, we are still close. When I am not working, I do not have to take work home. If I have difficult passengers, which is rare, I know the flight will end soon, and I will probably never see them again!'"

Most children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after we encourage them, they try and reach the top. This makes them feel very happy. Some children miss home at the start of the week. It's not the very young ones who miss home the most – it's the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we say they can call home after lunch. Then, when they ask again after dinner, we say it's too late now, call tomorrow. Most children are fine after a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us because they had a great time. Sometimes, it's not the children who feel lonely. We have parents who call a lot, asking how their child is doing, which is not needed. Often their child is busy playing games or doing something else, so we tell the parents to call back later. We often see a certain type of child come, usually wearing expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand why.'"

In the UK, it was hard to do the show with only British actors. This is because young actors in the UK can do fewer shows each week than in the USA. So, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, the director found many talented actors in the UK, and they just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, and it is full every night. People want to hear the songs that were first popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. ‘It’s great that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially on a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have school lessons every day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ What do his friends think of the show? ‘My whole class came! The theatre has special ticket prices for schools. They loved it and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found another guitar and asked me to play with him and the other young actors. We played a song called Days, which I didn’t know. Jamie helped me, and I was happy when I finally played it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s skills and wished I could play like him. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! The young actors were already musicians, and some play many instruments, but none had played in a band before. They found it easy. Jamie said the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it is really worth seeing.'"
