1,"Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: you might think you are just telling people, ""Hey, I'm here,"" but you are also letting everyone know you are not at home. This made people more aware that sharing too much online can be risky. The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, offering possibilities like wealth and fame. So, we dive into the internet, sharing personal stories and photos. But soon, we realize that the online world can be dangerous and confusing.

However, there is hope. Years ago, a group of online pioneers explored these risks. In the early days of the internet, they faced challenges like losing jobs and friends and dealing with fame, even before social media existed. These pioneers, the first bloggers, have experienced what many of us are going through now. We should learn from their experiences to avoid repeating their mistakes.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the ""WWW,"" which was mostly used by students and scientists. The web was created at Cern, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw it as a chance to share his life. He created a detailed online autobiography with text, photos, and art. In 1996, he started a daily blog, and many people followed his bold use of this new medium. Hall shared everything, but one day, his site disappeared, replaced by a video called Dark Night. He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" He realized that sharing too much online made people not trust him. He stopped blogging, but the problem of oversharing remains. Sharing online is fun, but if you expect it to make people like you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a colleague sent her blog to the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, and she lost her job. Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to big mistakes.

Armstrong's story ended well. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned that while the internet lets us say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
2,"Text: Some time ago, scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" This film used a mix of documentary and drama to show that there is a lot about our universe we don't understand. Most scientists agree that we don't know everything about the universe. However, some scientists felt the need to warn the public about the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""a very dangerous piece of work."" This made the film seem interesting to watch. At first, the film seemed harmless, with scientists saying that new discoveries show the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the film talked about discoveries like water molecules being affected by thoughts. It mentioned a Japanese researcher who claimed that the shape of a water molecule could change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice after being talked to by someone happy, and looking bad after being exposed to someone in a bad mood. Some people find this evidence convincing, but many scientists say, ""Give me a break."" They believe that while the idea is amazing, there needs to be solid proof. Pretty pictures of crystals are not enough. The real issue is that the film's claims were not strange enough. For example, water molecules might have properties due to a form of energy that comes from nowhere and is linked to a force expanding the universe. This idea is supported by decades of research. Scientists have discovered that the universe is made of unknown matter and is driven by a mysterious force called ""dark energy."" Besides the film, other discoveries are also amazing. Neuroscientists found that our perception of events is delayed by about half a second, but our brains edit this out. Anthropologists think they have found where modern humans first lived and why they spread across the world. Some theorists suggest there are links between life on Earth and the universe's design. Science is far from complete. We are further from knowing everything than ever before. Concepts like chaos and quantum uncertainty limit what we can know. Some top physicists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" to explain all forces and particles in the universe. Many people think the universe can be described in one word: incredible."
3,"Text: 'In simple terms, I find writing novels challenging and writing short stories enjoyable. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. These two activities complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I value. The trees provide shade, and the wind moves the leaves, which sometimes turn a bright gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, showing the change of seasons. Since I started my career as a fiction writer, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. My routine is this: after finishing a novel, I want to write short stories; after completing short stories, I focus on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and vice versa. These two types of writing might use different parts of the brain, and it takes time to switch from one to the other. After starting my career with two short novels in 1975, I began writing short stories from 1984 to 1985. I knew little about writing short stories then, so it was difficult, but the experience was memorable. I felt my fictional world expand. Readers seemed to like this other side of me as a writer. One of my early works, ‘Breaking Waves’, was in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. This was my start as a short-story writer. One joy of writing short stories is that they don’t take long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to shape a short story (though revisions can be endless). It’s not like the long commitment needed for a novel, which can take a year or two. You go into a room, finish your work, and leave. That’s it. Writing a novel can feel like it goes on forever, and I sometimes wonder if I will finish. So, writing short stories is a necessary change of pace. Another nice thing about short stories is that you can create them from small things – an idea, a word, an image. It’s often like jazz improvisation, with the story leading me. Also, with short stories, you don’t have to worry about failing. If the idea doesn’t work, you just move on. Even great writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn’t always write masterpieces. I find this comforting. You can learn from your mistakes and use that in the next story. When I write novels, I try to learn from the successes and failures of my short stories. In this way, short stories are like an experimental lab for me as a novelist. It’s hard to experiment in a novel, so without short stories, writing novels would be more difficult. My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint footprints I have left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers.'"
4,"Science can be very abstract, like philosophy, or very practical, like curing diseases. It has made our lives easier but also posed threats. Science tries to understand everything from tiny ants to the vast universe, but it often struggles. It influences poets, politicians, philosophers, and even tricksters. Its beauty is clear to experts, but its dangers are often misunderstood. People sometimes overestimate or underestimate its importance, and its mistakes are either ignored or exaggerated. 

Science is full of conflicts. Old theories are often changed or replaced by new ones, similar to how new music styles are first mocked but later accepted. Scientists can be competitive and emotional. This book will explore how scientific ideas have changed not just science but also human thought. We will focus on ideas, not practical inventions like non-stick pans. We will admire these ideas but also question them, recognizing both human creativity and limitations. 

Science is always changing. Scientists often challenge each other's ideas. Usually, these changes don't affect society much, but sometimes they cause big shifts in our beliefs. For example, in the 17th century, science described the universe as a giant clock. Three centuries later, physics showed that our observations can affect the universe. Some people think this shows science can't fully explain the universe, but scientific changes usually help us understand and predict nature better. Isaac Newton explained more than Aristotle, and Albert Einstein explained more than Newton. Science makes mistakes but keeps progressing. 

At the end of the 19th century, many physicists thought there was nothing new to discover. Then came radioactivity, X-rays, electrons, quantum mechanics, and more. Biology has also made many discoveries. Some people now claim we are close to a complete theory of everything. Maybe. 

Science is not just a harmless hobby. In the last two centuries, we have started to control nature, sometimes upsetting its balance without understanding the consequences. Science needs to be monitored. Non-scientists should not ignore scientific advances because they affect the future world and future generations. Science is now part of how we plan and shape our future. This is not just a philosophical question; it affects national budgets, health, and even the future of life on Earth."
5,"From around 2015, after years of growth, major publishers noticed that ebook sales had stopped increasing or even decreased. This raised new doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. One publishing executive admitted that the excitement about ebooks might have led to poor investments, with his company losing faith in the value of printed books. Despite the clear idea that digital and print books can exist together, people still wonder if ebooks will replace print books. Whether predicting or dismissing this idea, the thought of books disappearing continues to capture our imagination and spark debate. Why is this idea so strong? Why do we see ebooks and print books as being in conflict, even when evidence suggests otherwise? The answers go beyond ebooks and reveal our mixed feelings of excitement and fear about innovation and change. In my research, I have shown that the idea of one medium replacing another often comes with new technologies. Even before digital technology, people predicted the end of existing media. For example, when television was invented, many thought radio would die, but radio survived by finding new uses, like being listened to in cars. The idea of books disappearing isn’t new either. As early as 1894, people thought the phonograph would replace books with what we now call audiobooks. This pattern has repeated many times. Movies, radio, television, and smartphones have all been seen as threats to print books. Some thought the end of books would lead to cultural decline, while others exaggerated the benefits of ebooks. The idea of the death of the book often appears during times of technological change. This story reflects our hopes and fears about technology. To understand why these reactions are common, we must consider that we form emotional connections with media as they become part of our lives. Studies show we develop close ties with objects like books, TVs, and computers, even naming our cars or getting frustrated with our laptops. So, when new technology like e-readers appears, it doesn’t just mean economic and social change. It also means adjusting our bond with something important in our daily lives. As technology advances, we miss what we used to have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. For example, when the printing press spread in 15th-century Europe, people sought original manuscripts. The move from silent to sound movies in the 1920s made people nostalgic for silent films. The same happened with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. Not surprisingly, e-readers have made people appreciate the physical quality of old books, even their smell. This should reassure those worried about print books disappearing. Yet, the idea of a disappearing medium will continue to be a popular story about technology’s power and our resistance to change. We use familiar stories, like tragedy and endings, to understand change. The story of the death of the book reflects our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves."
6,"Text: 'Almost every weekday morning for a year and a half, I woke up at 5:30, brushed my teeth, made coffee, and sat down to write about how some of the greatest minds of the past four hundred years managed their daily work. I wanted to see how they organized their schedules to be creative and productive. By writing about the simple details of their daily lives – when they slept, ate, worked, and worried – I hoped to show a new side of their personalities and careers. I wanted to create interesting portraits of these artists as creatures of habit, just like us. The French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ‘Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are.’ I say, ‘Tell me what time you eat, and if you take a nap afterward.’ In this way, this book is about the circumstances of creative activity, not the product itself. It’s about how things are made, not what they mean. But it’s also personal. The novelist John Cheever believed that even writing a business letter reveals something about your inner self. My main concerns in the book are issues I face in my own life: How do you do meaningful creative work while also earning a living? Is it better to focus completely on a project or to work on it a little each day? And when there isn’t enough time for everything, do you have to give things up (like sleep, money, or a clean house), or can you learn to do more in less time, to ‘work smarter, not harder’, as my dad always says? I don’t claim to answer these questions in the book – some of them might not have answers, or can only be solved individually. But I have tried to show examples of how different successful people have faced these challenges. I wanted to show how big creative ideas are built from small daily actions; how working habits affect the work itself, and vice versa. The book’s title is Daily Rituals, but I focused on people’s routines. A routine can seem ordinary and automatic, but it can also be a well-planned way to use limited resources: time, willpower, and optimism. A good routine helps keep your mind focused and prevents you from being controlled by your moods. The psychologist William James thought you should put part of your life on autopilot; by forming good habits, he said, we can ‘free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action.’ Ironically, James himself often procrastinated and couldn’t stick to a regular schedule. Interestingly, it was a moment of procrastination that led to this book. One Sunday afternoon, I was alone in the office of the small architecture magazine where I worked, trying to write a story due the next day. Instead of working, I was tidying my desk, making coffee, and wasting time. I’m a ‘morning person’, able to focus well in the early hours but not so much after lunch. That afternoon, to feel better about this habit, I started looking online for information about other writers’ work schedules. These were easy to find and very interesting. I thought someone should collect these stories in one place – so I started the Daily Routines blog that afternoon, and now, this book. The blog was casual; I just posted descriptions of people’s routines as I found them in biographies, magazine profiles, newspaper obituaries, and similar sources. For the book, I’ve gathered a much larger and better-researched collection, while keeping the short and varied voices that made the blog appealing. As much as possible, I’ve let my subjects speak for themselves, using quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. In other cases, I have summarized their routines from other sources. I should mention that this book wouldn’t have been possible without the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose work I used. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also guide further reading.'"
7,"Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in interest rates when he was six years old. His father, who was careful with money and had a big mortgage, decided they couldn't afford a holiday to Spain. Instead, they rented a chalet on the English coast. There, on a rainy August day, Howard found an ammonite* on the beach. From that moment, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. By the end of his university studies, he knew what kind of palaeontologist he wanted to be. He was interested in the very early history of life, not in dinosaurs or the Jurassic period. He studied ancient, delicate creatures found in grey rocks. 

When he finished his doctoral thesis, he worried about finding a job, especially the kind of job he wanted. He was confident in his abilities but knew that deserving something doesn't always mean you get it. When a job at Tavistock College in London was advertised, he applied immediately, though he wasn't very hopeful. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to lead the panel had an argument with his wife, crashed his car, and ended up in the hospital. The interview went on without him, and the professor who replaced him disliked the original professor's favorite candidate. This led to Howard getting the job. Howard was surprised by the support from someone he didn't know, but later learned the real reason he was chosen. He was a little disappointed but mostly happy to have the job he wanted.

Howard often thought about how his professional life was organized and planned, unlike the chaos of personal life. He realized how strangers could change your life, like when his briefcase with lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. Angry, he returned to the college, postponed his lecture, and reported the theft. Then he had coffee with a colleague and a visiting curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This meeting led him to learn about a new collection of fossils that would be his biggest challenge and secure his career. If not for the theft, he wouldn't have known about this opportunity. He quickly changed his plans, deciding not to go to a conference in Stockholm or take students on a field trip to Scotland. Instead, he focused on finding the money to visit the museum in Nairobi."
8,"Charles Spence is willing to try almost any food. ""We have ice cream made from bee larvae at home,"" says the Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University in the UK. Although they look like maggots, they have a ""slightly nutty, floral"" taste. Making bug-eating acceptable is just one of the challenges Spence and his team are working on. Through his research on how our senses combine to create our perception of flavor, Spence is quietly influencing what we eat and drink. He works with both large food companies and top restaurants. Spence and his colleagues study how we experience food and drink, a field informally known as gastrophysics. They look at details like who we eat with, how food is presented, the color and texture of plates, and background noise—all of which affect taste. Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal,"" co-written with Betina Piqueras-Fiszman, offers many interesting insights. Did you know that the first person to order in a restaurant usually enjoys their meal the most? Or that we eat about 35% more when dining with one other person, and 75% more with three others?

Spence's lab in Oxford is simple and low-tech. It has soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. By keeping costs low, he can work creatively with chefs who can't afford academic research. Much of his work is funded by a major food company. In the past, research funded by industry was seen as less serious in universities. But now, since the government wants universities to show their work has an impact, this type of research is more valued. Spence is helping well-known brands reduce salt and sugar, often because of government rules. Companies do this gradually so customers don't notice the change. ""Research shows that if you tell people about the changes, they focus on the taste and don't like it as much,"" he says.

Spence first met Heston Blumenthal, a famous experimental chef, while working on a project for a big food company. People used to think science and food didn't mix, but most food is scientific. Blumenthal and Spence worked together on the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish at Blumenthal's restaurant. Interestingly, Spence notes that the Italian futurists were experimenting with sound and food a century ago, but it didn't become popular. Now, the food industry is using Spence's sensory science widely. For example, his research shows that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched sounds make it taste bitter. An airline will soon match music with the food served to passengers. Last year, a brand released a smartphone app that played music while your ice cream softened, but they didn't match the music to the taste, which Spence says happens often.

At home, Spence's dinner parties are unique. Once, they ate rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. Another time, they used remote-controlled, multi-colored light bulbs. They've also had parties with a tone generator, headphones, and different drinks to see if they have different pitches. For Spence, home, shops, food conventions, and international gastronomy conferences are all extensions of his lab."
9,"Our brains are busier than ever. We are bombarded with facts, fake facts, chatter, and rumors, all pretending to be information. We have to sort through this to find what we need and what we can ignore. At the same time, we are doing more tasks ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights, and salespeople helped us in stores. Now, we do most things on our own. We are doing the work of many people while trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows. Smartphones help us fit as much as possible into every spare moment. But there is a problem. We think we are multitasking, doing several things at once, but this is a dangerous illusion. Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT, says our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we think we are multitasking, we are actually switching quickly from one task to another, which has a mental cost. We are not expert jugglers; we are more like amateur plate spinners, quickly switching tasks and worrying about dropping one. Multitasking makes us less efficient. It increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause mental fog. Multitasking also creates a craving for new stimulation. The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain, is easily distracted by new things. This is a problem because we need this part of the brain to focus. Just having the chance to multitask can hurt our thinking. Glenn Wilson, a former professor of psychology, calls it info-mania. His research found that trying to focus on a task while an email is unread in your inbox can lower your IQ by almost 10 points. This loss is greater than the loss from being tired. Russ Poldrack, a neuroscientist at Stanford, found that learning while multitasking sends information to the wrong part of the brain. If students do homework and watch TV at the same time, the information goes to the striatum, which stores new skills, not facts. Without TV, the information goes to the hippocampus, where it is organized and easier to remember. Multitasking also involves decision-making, which is hard on our brains. Small decisions use the same brain resources as big ones, leading to poor decisions. Business leaders, scientists, and writers often mention email as a problem. It is not the email itself, but the overwhelming amount of communication. A colleague's 10-year-old son said his father ""answers emails"" for a living, which is almost true. We feel we must reply to emails, but it seems impossible to do so and get other things done."
10,"In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino spent his nights breaking concrete into pieces to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other fruit bat mothers if they can’t find the right position to give birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, these questions would not have been important. Animals had behaviors, and science recorded the results of these behaviors. The idea that animals have feelings and moral systems was seen as sentimental. But recently, this has started to change. Research into the behavior of bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has begun to explore animal emotions. This change has reached popular science books, like Mark Bekoff’s ""Wild Justice"" and Victoria Braithwaite’s ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a debate: can animals be said to have consciousness? This leads to another question: do animals have a conscience, a sense of right and wrong? In a recent experiment with cows, those that opened a locked gate to get food showed more pleasure than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does this mean for how we produce and consume beef? The observations are clear, but their interpretation is debated. Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, author of ""Second Nature"", believes the logical response to this research is to stop eating meat. He thinks humanity is on the verge of a major ethical change. Aubrey Manning, Professor Emeritus at Edinburgh University, believes we should rethink our view of animal thinking. He says, ‘the only tenable hypothesis is that animals do have a theory of mind, but it’s simpler than ours.’ Professor Euan MacPhail thinks we should stop giving animals human traits. The issue is not just scientific or moral, but philosophical. Since defining consciousness is difficult, can we ever know what it is like to be a bat? Balcombe describes an experiment that suggests starlings, a type of bird, can get depressed. At Newcastle University, starlings were split into two groups. Half were in large, comfortable cages, and the other half in small, empty cages. Both groups learned to eat tasty worms from one box and avoid unpleasant worms from another. Later, when only unpleasant worms were offered, only the birds in comfortable cages ate them. Balcombe concluded that being in a bad cage made the starlings pessimistic. Balcombe, who has worked with animal rights groups, has a clear bias. He says, ‘We look back with horror on times of racism. Our view about animals will someday be the same. We can’t support animal rights while eating a cheeseburger.’ If he were the only one with this view, it might be easy to dismiss him. But Professor Aubrey Manning shares his view. Manning has written a textbook, ""An Introduction to Animal Behaviour"". He says, ‘What we are seeing is a pendulum swing. At the start of the 20th century, people thought animals were like us, and there was a reaction against that. Now we are going the other way. But it is a highly debated subject, and you want to avoid the sound of academics with personal grievances and strong opinions.’"
11,"Critical thinking is a way of understanding what we read or hear. Adrian West, from the Edward de Bono Foundation U.K., says that argument can help find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it might also change how we solve problems and think deeply. West warns that we face a lot of poor thinking and opinions, which can overwhelm our ability to reason. More data doesn't always mean better knowledge or decisions. 

The National Endowment for the Arts reports that reading has dropped by 10%, and this decline is speeding up. Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, believes that focusing more on visual media can reduce critical thinking. She says that less reading might lead to less critical thinking because people focus more on real-time media and multitasking. However, we still don't have a clear answer on how technology affects critical thinking. Technology's impact is complex, and it can be both good and bad. For example, a computer game might help or hurt critical thinking. Reading online can improve analysis, but too many links can stop deeper thought.

Greenfield, who studied over 50 reports on learning and technology, says that technology changes how we think. Reading helps imagination and critical thinking, while visual media can improve some information processing. But most visual media don't allow time for reflection or imagination. This can lead to people, especially young ones, not reaching their full potential.

How we view technology affects our thoughts on critical thinking. Video games and cognition show this conflict. James Paul Gee, an educational psychology professor, says video games can be good for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills. They let players explore ideas that might be hard to access otherwise. In the digital age, as reading and math scores drop, we need to understand how technology affects thinking and analysis."
12,"Matthew Crawford is a writer and motorcycle mechanic. He left office work because he was unhappy with it. His first book talked about the benefits of manual work. His latest book is about dealing with modern life. He got the idea for this book while shopping. He noticed ads on the credit card machine while entering his pin. Crawford realized that these ads are hard to avoid and take our attention. He believes that what we focus on is personal, but we are losing control over it. It is becoming harder to think or remember past conversations. To avoid constant interruptions, people are closing themselves off and avoiding simple interactions like talking to strangers. Crawford says we experience the world through things like video games and phone apps, which can be manipulative. These things reflect our desires and can take over our attention. Many people are worried about this issue. For example, office workers complain about emails but spend their free time on them. Studies show that just seeing a phone on the table can distract us. There is no scientific proof yet that our attention spans are shorter, but we are more aware of other things we could be doing. Crawford thinks technology has made it easy for us to focus on ourselves. This constant choice affects our self-control and social life. We prefer texting to talking because it feels safer. By only interacting with representations of people, we might lose something important in society. Screens are part of the problem. Crawford gives an example from his gym. There used to be one music player for everyone, which could cause tension. Now, people listen to their own music with ear buds, making the gym less social. Crawford suggests two solutions. First, we need rules to reduce noise and distraction in public spaces. More importantly, he suggests engaging in skilled activities like cooking, playing ice hockey, or racing motorcycles. These activities require dealing with real things and using good judgment. They help us connect with the world in a satisfying way. This doesn't mean everyone should become a chef, but it's important to use your judgment. There are many benefits, including professional satisfaction. Constantly fighting distractions is tiring and makes it hard to focus. Paying attention to one thing helps you focus better on other things."
13,"Text: ""‘What do you do for a living?’ is a common question. We often define ourselves by our jobs. Usually, this question is easy to answer. However, when you are a philosopher, like me, it can be a bit tricky. Calling yourself a philosopher might sound pretentious. Saying you study or teach philosophy is fine, but saying you are a philosopher can seem like you claim to know some special truth. This is not true; philosophers are just like everyone else. But this idea makes me pause. Why does this stereotype exist? One reason is that philosophers are seen as people who judge others and value intellectual life. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE) said that a life of thinking, or a philosophical life, was the best life. Few modern philosophers agree, but philosophy is still linked with thinking deeply. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said, ‘the unexamined life is not worth living’. He meant that just accepting what society says is not satisfying. Our ability to think about the world helps us control our lives and make decisions. But living an examined life doesn’t mean reading lots of philosophy books or spending all your time thinking. It means looking closely at everyday experiences to see if they are important. It doesn’t mean living like a wise person away from society. In fact, to help people, the examined life should be practical and shared with others. This leads to another reason for the misunderstanding about philosophers: academic philosophy has become distant from real life, especially for people without formal training. This isn’t entirely philosophers’ fault: university funding and evaluations are linked to expensive and hard-to-access journals. So, philosophers often only talk to other experts in their field. For most people, philosophy can seem far from reality. If philosophers once tried to change this view, many have stopped. The university system created this isolated environment, and academics have supported it. As some areas of philosophy focus on specific, technical debates, explaining them to non-experts is very hard. Philosophy, in some cases, has moved away from society. This needs to change. I sometimes call myself an ‘ethicist’ because I work in ethics, the part of philosophy that looks at human actions. But recently, I feel this title doesn’t fully describe my work, because ethics is often linked to rules and laws. This is a new development in philosophy: ethics now often means applied ethics, which looks at the fairness of social practices. The job of an ethicist today is to decide if an action is ‘ethical’ or acceptable. These are important questions, and I often think about them. However, philosophy is more than this. A typical discussion might start by asking if illegally downloading films is wrong (it is) and then explore ideas about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy helps people look more closely at their actions and beliefs. Sometimes we find out what we already know; other times, we see our beliefs are hard to justify. By examining these ideas, we help everyone."""
14,"Text: 'People who love food, like foodies, chefs, and gourmands, might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, in history, philosophers have often talked about food to discuss other topics, like learning. Sometimes, discussions that seem to be about food are actually about other, loosely related ideas. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus talked about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain in many areas of life. Yet, his name is often linked with a love for eating and drinking. We see his name used in restaurants and food shops, likely because businesses think it will attract customers. Food is social and cultural. It comes from history and is shared with others in our communities. These communities give us people to eat with and the systems to grow and share food. We interact with food more than any other product, making it an interesting topic for philosophy. Once food is made, critics talk and write about it. But why do they have such an important role? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill, but that food critics are just better at describing tastes. This area has not been studied much because most research on perception focuses on sight. Another part of food is its beauty. We say paintings or music are beautiful, but not usually food. Some philosophers think that with modern cooking, food should be part of discussions about beauty, like art or poetry. But food is eaten and disappears, unlike art, which lasts over time. So, some think food cannot be considered in the same way as art. There are many ethical questions about food. We can ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, local, vegetarian, or non-GMO foods? Our choices often show our ethical beliefs, and philosophers explore why we make these choices. Cooking at home and in restaurants is different. Home cooks have a duty to their guests because of personal relationships. At home, everyone shares food and friendship. Professional cooks have responsibilities to their employers and the food, so their kitchens are not open to everyone, only to qualified people. Their relationships are professional, not personal. A recent essay called ‘Diplomacy of the Dish’ looks at how food can help bridge cultural gaps. This happens in two ways. First, we can appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food. Second, we build personal connections with people from other cultures by eating together, a practice with a long history in diplomacy. The essay includes many examples and stories that make this part of food philosophy interesting for readers.'"
15,"Rob Daviau, from the US, creates 'legacy' board games. He felt that the board games he played as a child were not fun or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a storyline or if decisions made in one game could affect the next. He changed a classic board game called Risk to make a new version: Risk Legacy. In this game, decisions made during play have a lasting effect. Players might have to tear up cards, write on the board, or open packets with new rules. The game is played over a set number of sessions, and past actions become part of the game. Daviau said: ‘You could point to the board and say: “Right here! You did this!”’

Daviau was then asked to help create a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular game where players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. While Pandemic Legacy was very popular, SeaFall was seen as a real test of the legacy format because it was not based on an earlier game. Set in the age of sail (16th – mid 19th century), players explore and conquer new lands. Legacy game designers must think about all possible player choices to keep the story together. They use testers to see how the game will play out. Jaime Barriga, a tester for SeaFall, said: ‘It takes a lot of time. Sometimes the first few games are great, but then it starts to fall apart, and you have to fix everything.’

Legacy board games were not expected to become popular. Even Daviau thought it would be a small interest. ‘When I was working on it, I thought: “This is different and good,”’ he said. ‘But it’s strange and breaks many rules. I thought only a few people would like it.’ However, many players, like Russell Chapman, loved the idea. He thinks it is a big step forward in game design. ‘It’s a new level of commitment, intensity, excitement,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing more exciting for a board gamer than learning a new game or way to play.’

Another fan, Ben Hogg, said the adventure was more important than worries about the game’s lifespan. ‘At first, I was worried about changing and ruining the board,’ he said. ‘But Pandemic Legacy changed that. Most people don’t watch the same movie twice, do they? You’re buying an experience. It’s like the stories in video games.’ The legacy format is influenced by video games and popular TV series. Daviau once wanted to be a TV writer but moved to advertising and then game design. The love of storytelling stayed with him. Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compares designing a legacy game to writing a novel. ‘You need to know how it starts and ends,’ he said. ‘But you also need more than just an outline.’

While Daviau feels proud of his work, he is interested in seeing what others do with the idea. But he also thinks people will soon want something new. Colby Dauch, from the publisher of SeaFall, believes the legacy format has changed how people think about board games. ‘It’s the kind of idea that changes what a board game can be.’"
16,"Text: 'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at New Zealand’s National Aquarium. He moved across the floor and squeezed into a drain leading to the Pacific Ocean. This story was shared widely online and seemed like something from a children's movie. Stories like this, about animals escaping, are fun because they make us think animals are like us. This is especially true for octopuses, which are very smart but look so different from us. How can these sea creatures open jars, recognize faces, use coconut shells as armor, and even play? 

People often think it's unscientific to say animals are like humans, but Dr. Frans de Waal, who studies primates like gorillas and chimpanzees, disagrees. He says the real problem is not recognizing the human-like traits in animals, which he calls anthropodenial. By looking at animal-cognition research, he shows that animals can do many things we thought only humans could do, like thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives. Animals are smarter than we thought.

In the past, people believed animals had complex minds. In medieval Europe, animals could even be put on trial for crimes. In the nineteenth century, naturalists looked for connections between human and animal intelligence. Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, said the difference between humans and animals is one of degree, not kind.

In the twentieth century, behaviorism changed how people viewed animal intelligence. Animals were seen as machines that responded to rewards and punishments. People who thought animals had inner lives were considered unscientific. This view came at a time when humans were destroying animal habitats and ignoring animal welfare.

Dr. de Waal believes we are now starting to see animal intelligence as similar to human intelligence, though not the same. He says the best tests of animal intelligence consider the unique traits of each species. For example, squirrels might not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid nuts. In her book, The Soul of an Octopus, naturalist Sy Montgomery suggests that if octopuses tested human intelligence, they might think we are not very smart because we can't change our skin color like they can.

Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found his way to the ocean, but he knows that viral stories can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys feel envy. When some monkeys got cucumbers and others got grapes, the ones with cucumbers got upset. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a video clip of the experiment convinced more people. This shows how our minds work in interesting ways.'"
17,"Text: 'Robotics, once only seen in science fiction, is now becoming a major technological change, similar to the impact of industrialisation. Robots have been used in car and manufacturing industries for many years, but experts now say that robots will soon be used in many more areas. However, many countries are not ready for this big change. Most people agree that robots will take over many jobs in the next 50 years, but they still believe their own jobs will remain the same. This is not true: robotic automation will affect every industry soon. For example, an Australian company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot called Hadrian X that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, a job that would take two human workers almost a day. In San Francisco, a startup called Simbe Robotics has made Tally, a robot that moves through supermarket aisles to check that products are stocked and priced correctly. Supporters of robotic automation say that robots cannot yet service or program themselves, which means new jobs will be created for technicians and programmers. Critics warn that we should not ignore the importance of human skills at work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert in robotics, studies how robots are changing the workforce. His research shows that soon, many robots will be smarter and able to work with humans. In a few years, many top companies will have a chief robotics officer, and some governments will have laws about robots. Salaries in the robotics field will rise, but many jobs will remain unfilled due to a lack of skilled workers. Zhang says that people with lower skills will be affected by automation and should retrain to adapt. New developments in technology will lead to new types of robots for consumers, like robots that live in our homes and interact with us. This change offers great opportunities for companies but also requires new rules to protect our safety and privacy. With many jobs at risk, education is key to preparing for the future workforce. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'"
18,"Text: George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, is known for his simple answer to why he wanted to climb Mount Everest: ""Because it’s there."" This response reflects a common curiosity about why people engage in such dangerous activities. Mallory's answer might inspire some to follow their dreams, challenging them to face the unknown. The real value of his answer is its simplicity, suggesting that climbing might be just for adventure and fun.

In 1967, Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores wrote an important essay called ‘Games that Climbers Play’. He described seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He believed that the style of climbing, like using more or less equipment, should match the rules of the specific climbing activity. Over the years, this idea has become very popular in Western climbing discussions, from magazines to debates.

Many climbers love the feeling of freedom that climbing gives them. However, climbing can also be very limiting, like being stuck in a tent during a storm. This creates a paradox: climbing can feel both freeing and restricting. But some argue that the simplicity of climbing, with limited choices, is a form of freedom.

US rock climber Joe Fitschen offers a different perspective. He suggests asking ""Why do people climb?"" to explore why humans are drawn to climbing. Fitschen believes climbing is in our genes, a natural part of us that pushes us to take on challenges and test limits, even with risks.

US academic Brian Treanor adds that climbing can help develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for nature. He believes these virtues are important in our modern, risk-averse world. Climbing, therefore, has practical value in helping people develop traits that are useful in everyday life.

Another idea is that climbers who climb without help or technology must be fully committed to succeed. Experts Ebert and Robinson argue that independent climbs deserve more recognition because they are harder and riskier. However, this view has caused some controversy, as it might encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Finally, climbing can be seen from a non-Western perspective. Many climbers talk about being ""in the moment"" or ""in the zone"" during a climb. The physical effort, active meditation, and intuitive problem-solving are key parts of climbing. Some say these aspects are similar to Zen philosophy, which aims for a state of perfect peace. This offers another reason why people are drawn to climbing."
19,"For over sixty years, the pianist Alfred Brendel became a leading figure in classical music. He was known as an intellectual and serious person who focused on European piano music. He wrote and performed a lot but rarely taught. People close to him saw a playful side, but this was not often seen in his concerts. His life was a disciplined routine of study, travel, and performance. 

Then, a few years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel did not take the request seriously. He had taught very few students and did not see a reason to start now. He quoted another famous pianist: ‘You don’t employ a mountain guide to teach a child how to walk.’ However, something about Kit, who was about 14 at the time, caught his attention. Brendel listened to him play and was impressed. Kit played very well from memory and gave Brendel a CD of a recital where he played beautifully. Brendel thought, “I have to make time for him.” Kit’s performance was rare because he had a complete understanding of the music and the necessary subtlety.

As Brendel is retiring from public performances, Kit is starting to become known, but Brendel is careful to prevent him from burning out. Kit, now 19, is always busy learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, or playing tennis, all under the watchful eye of his mother. He also composes music. Brendel says, ‘Learning to read music is helped by trying to write something yourself. Kit has a phenomenal memory and is a great sight reader. More importantly, he listens to his own playing and understands my explanations. He not only understands but can also apply it throughout a piece.’

Brendel is cautious about raising expectations. He is upset when newspapers call Kit the future great pianist of the 21st century, as it can be harmful. Like many talented young musicians, Kit can play some things very well, but others need more time and experience. Critics expecting perfection could be damaging.

Now at 80, Brendel is more relaxed in his retirement. He says, ‘When I was young, I didn’t want to be famous quickly, but I wanted to achieve certain things by 50. By then, I had done most of them, but there was still room for more, so I continued. Although I don’t have the physical strength now, my mind is still active with music I’ve never played. I don’t perform now, but it’s a nice new phase in my life.’"
20,"When I was little, I always thought gardens were magical places. My Grandad’s garden was not in a dirty city. It was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. You couldn’t reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this – places of escape, peace, and quiet. Grandad’s garden was simple. He didn’t have a greenhouse like some of his neighbors. Their greenhouses were made from old window frames, with plastic patches where glass was broken.

At home, my father was often quiet. He wasn’t without humor, though. He liked to say things like, ‘It’s immaterial to me,’ instead of just saying, ‘I don’t mind.’ He probably wished he had achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, but he wasn’t passionate about it. He and my mom once thought about moving to Canada, but it didn’t happen. He was very skilled at home repairs, like making bookshelves or cupboards.

My parents only moved house once, but my mother often changed the furniture. The biggest change was when a piano arrived. I wanted to like it, but it intimidated me. I liked the brass candlesticks on it, but my mother thought they were too fancy and removed them. I was never allowed to play the piano; my sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I didn’t get lessons, she said, ‘You’d never have practiced.’

I loved the river the most. I would go there with a fishing net and sandals that were too small, with the fronts cut out for my toes. I’d find a spot to leave my sandals and picnic, then look for fish to catch. After trying to keep them alive at home, I would release them back into the river.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father said, ‘There’s an apprentice gardener job in the Parks Department. I thought you might be interested.’ My dad might have preferred me to be a carpenter, but I think he saw my passion for gardening. Even though he didn’t like gardening, he noticed how much I loved it."
21,"Lawrence MacEwen crouches down on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. I do the same. A strong Atlantic wind threatens to blow us off the steep cliff and into the ocean 120 meters below. MacEwen’s sheepdog, Tie, comes up, and his owner gently strokes him. Despite the howling wind, MacEwen looks perfectly at home on his island. He is showing me around. Pointing to the north, he shouts, ‘That island is Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do.’ I see heavy clouds dropping rain on Rum’s mountains. ‘Just beyond Rum is the island of Soay.’ Suddenly, MacEwen says, ‘I have sheep to move,’ as rain approaches. We walk down the slopes, and he tells me about the island: Muck is three km long and half as wide; its geese eat a lot of grass; and the MacEwens have lived here for 3000 years. Moving the sheep interrupts our conversation. Tie, the sheepdog, is circling the sheep but not doing it well. ‘Away to me, Tie. Away to me,’ MacEwen calls, meaning the dog should go to the right. Tie doesn’t listen and goes straight through the flock, causing confusion. ‘Tie,’ MacEwen says, disappointed. ‘That will never do.’ The dog looks ashamed. The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son Colin manages the island cottages; and their daughter Mary runs the island hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their two boys can explore the island and sail small boats in the summer. ‘They go out and come back only when they’re hungry.’ But island life has its challenges. For example, electricity is only available part of the time. On my first evening, I wait for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I find Mary preparing breakfast by torchlight. I manage without electricity and mobile phone service. ‘There is mobile reception on the hill,’ Mary tells me. ‘Most people last a couple of days, then just put the phone away.’ So I do too. Everything on Muck seems wonderfully unusual. Today, the boat brings groceries and three musicians, who perform in the island’s tearoom. The concert is a big success, with islanders tapping their boots to the music. That night, by a warm fire, Lawrence MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. ‘Her father bought a small farm on the isle of Soay from a newspaper ad, without seeing it. He’d never been to Scotland. Jenny was sent to manage it.’ Did Jenny know about farming? ‘She had good typing skills.’ I go to bed with rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, with almost all the food coming from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish. I bring it back to Mary at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it’s delicious. Also uncertain is my ferry ride the next morning to another island. Many ferries had been canceled in the past two months due to high seas. If my ferry didn’t come, I’d be stuck on Muck for two more days. Which, now, phone or no phone, I secretly hoped for."
22,"Text: 'The game design industry was once mainly for computer scientists and self-taught people. It didn't have many ways for others to join. Often seen as just a hobby for young people, the video games industry is now taken seriously. Industry experts are not surprised. It's not easy, though. Video game spin-offs from new movies need many team members and months of hard work and skill. Like many industries, it's hard to enter, but it is growing. Jim Donelly, from an online games magazine, says: ‘It’s very hard to make progress in big companies or to influence big mainstream games. But the industry needs game designers more than ever. Not just directors who lead a whole game, but also people who design systems and parts of games.’ So, how can you enter this competitive industry? Many companies prefer people with a computer science degree, but Jim disagrees. ‘There is only one way: make games. The tools are available. You won’t get a job if you haven’t made something. Game design is more a way of life than just a job. Like any creative work, it must be done to be real.’ Another expert, John Field, sees other options. ‘There’s a lot to be said for “just doing it”, but it’s more complicated. Many want to work in games, but few meet the industry’s needs; even fewer have the creative talent, technical skills, vision, and business ability to really help the changing industry.’ Can you do it alone? ‘Maybe, but it’s hard,’ says John. ‘A good postgraduate course in games can help and give support and guidance. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and have a strong interest in arts and culture. They may have worked for a few years after graduation but realized games are their passion. They are not just fans but are excited about the future of games and know about the growing variety of the form. Connections can also help. To get ahead in games, as in many areas, you need to network.’ The old idea of a teenage boy playing games all day is gone. Now, games are seen as a mature medium that grabs our attention. Families often play together on interactive consoles. Smartphones offer many new games through apps and social media. John believes there is room for growth. ‘Games have become popular for large audiences. They are also a great way to learn, and I see this area as full of possibilities and opportunities.’"
23,"Text: 'Since I was a child, all I’ve ever wanted to do was play football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I had a friend who came to the park with us, and his dad was very pushy. He always said, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that.’ My friend could have been a good player, but he stopped wanting to play and has never played football since. I’m glad it didn’t happen to me, but I know it could have been different. When I score an amazing goal from far away, people often say it’s just luck, but it isn’t. I have practiced shooting from a distance since I was a kid. Only by practicing can you score the spectacular goals that feel so exciting. The best players in the world, who have amazing natural talent, would never have achieved what they have without years of practice. Sometimes you see young players crashing into each other, but I was taught technique. If I’m teaching kids, the most important thing I try to teach is to enjoy learning skills. I used to do every sport at school. I’d get involved in anything, from rounders and baseball to athletics and basketball. I know now it’s important to get a good education, but football was the only thing on my mind then. The teachers were doing a good job, but I didn’t realize it at the time. I don’t want it to be like that for my son. We’re already trying to read him books even though he’s too young to sit still for long. I hope the fact that he usually wants to kick them around doesn’t mean he takes after me in that way. At the start of my professional football career, the manager made sacrifices so that some of us younger players could play for the first team, but he never made a big deal about it. He never said, ‘This is your big chance to prove yourselves,’ but we all knew we had to. Although I scored in the first game of the season, we lost, and a famous TV presenter said, ‘You can’t win anything with kids’. That made us aware of how much we had to do. You always have a few doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team despite what he said. I rely on close friends and family a lot. But having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people sometimes say to me, ‘I can’t believe you let your mother keep working.’ Of course, I’ve helped my parents financially. I paid off the loan on their house and bought them a car last Christmas. My family are strong individuals and I think they would be offended at the idea that they should be on the payroll. My mum doesn’t earn a lot as a hairdresser but she loves what she does. On the other hand, it gives me pleasure to use my money to make things easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, though not as much as people say, but that doesn’t give me all the answers. After I stop playing, I think I’ll take a year off or maybe even longer, doing the things I haven’t been able to do all these years. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing. I can’t do that now because if I were to break a leg skiing and couldn’t play football again, I wouldn’t be insured.'"
24,"Sam Carter was the reason we were living at Reef Point. He was my father’s agent in Los Angeles. My father couldn’t write anything sellable while we lived in Los Angeles, so Sam, worried about losing clients and money, offered to find us a cheap place to live. During the summer, the beach was empty because sea fogs often covered the sun. Reef Point wasn’t popular with day-trippers. The road was not inviting, and the nicer resort of La Carmella was nearby. Only people with little money or those who loved surfing would come to Reef Point. But when the weather got hot, the place filled with people. After months of being almost alone, we were now surrounded by people and activities. My father was busy trying to write a script by a deadline and was in a bad mood. Most days, I went to the beach with a book and my dog, Rusty, for company. We didn’t have a dog when we first moved to Reef Point, but Rusty decided to stay with us. I tried to chase him away, but he kept coming back. One morning, I gave him water, and my father half-heartedly threw a boot at him. Rusty stayed closer. I asked my father who Rusty might belong to, and he said, ‘He thinks we belong to him.’ Rusty loved the beach and often dug things up to bring to me. Sometimes he brought things he hadn’t dug up, like a new sneaker or a bright beach towel, which I had to return to their owners. He also liked to swim and always came with me, even though I swam faster and farther. He never got discouraged. That day, my father had gone to Los Angeles to deliver his script, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming. As the sun set, we watched the surfers. They had been surfing all day and didn’t seem to get tired. One surfer stood out to me. She was very skilled. She decided to stop for the day and rode in on a final wave. She said, ‘Hi, why didn’t you join us?’ I replied, ‘I haven’t got a surfboard.’ She suggested I get one, but I said I had no money. She asked if I was British and visiting. I said I lived there. She asked if my father was American. I said no, he came to write a film script of a novel he wrote. She asked if she might know him and his name. I said, ‘Rufus Marsh.’ She recognized the name and mentioned his book, Tall as the Morning. I nodded, and she looked at me with new interest. I realized people were friendly but only really interested when I mentioned Tall as the Morning."
25,"Violet Hetherington stood in a long queue at the dock in Southampton, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie, who often traveled, had advised her to arrive late to avoid waiting, but this time the advice was wrong. An announcement over the loudspeakers said there was a problem with the computer system, which made the passengers frustrated. They had paid a lot for this trip and expected better service. Violet felt like leaving, especially when she realized she had lost her phone. She couldn’t call the taxi company to check if she left it there because all her contacts were saved on the phone. Her son Harry always warned her about this kind of mistake. 

Violet asked a friendly couple behind her if she could use their phone. She called Harry and left a message, asking him to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at her flat. If it wasn’t there, she would have trouble finding the numbers she needed in New York. Part of her felt relieved, but she didn’t tell Harry that. Harry thought he was wiser than his mother, while her younger son Daniel was more understanding because he was forgetful too. 

Finally, the queue moved, and Violet handed over her travel documents to board the ship. Her heart sank when she saw the ship’s foyer, which looked like a hotel trying too hard to be fancy. There were fake walnut panels, shiny chandeliers, and carpets like those in airports. She followed signs to the elevators, which were full of tired passengers. Violet was pressed against the side of the lift as it stopped at each floor. At last, she reached the twelfth floor and was relieved to find her room had the balcony she wanted. She had paid extra to ensure she could see the sea, ignoring Annie’s advice to wait for a last-minute deal."
26,"When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction, he didn't know he was about to discover the mystery of Vivian Maier. Maloof was searching for images for a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, USA. Instead, he found 30,000 images by Maier, a street photographer with a talent for capturing interesting images. Since then, Maloof has collected an archive of Maier’s life and work. In his attic studio, he has her cameras, 2,000 rolls of film, 3,000 prints, and 100,000 negatives, along with many 8mm movies and audiotapes. One morning, Maloof looked around at all of it, realizing he had found something special by chance. ‘When I bought all this, I had no idea what it was,’ Maloof said. ‘I’m a third-generation flea market seller and could have easily just sold it all to someone else.’ Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been trying to learn more about Maier’s life. They talked to local families who hired her as a nanny and employees of the shop where she developed her film. Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent much of her childhood in France. In 1951, she returned to New York and in 1956 moved to Chicago to work as a nanny. Maier, who was known to be private and a bit unusual, always carried a camera. She wore oversized coats, broad-brimmed hats, and sturdy shoes. ‘On her day off, she would leave with her camera in the morning and return late at night,’ said Maren Baylaender, whose husband hired Maier to care for his daughter. ‘She was private but had strong opinions about movies and politics.’ Maier knew a lot about theater and movies. Although she wasn’t very sociable, she wasn’t afraid to walk the streets with her camera and talk to people, some of whom she recorded on audiotape. She seemed very dedicated to her ‘second job’ of documenting the world around her. ‘She was a true artist and followed her dreams,’ said Rydzon. ‘She didn’t let anyone stop her.’ Maier’s work is pure art; none of it was for commercial reasons. Her images often show women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. ‘What is intriguing about Vivian is that there are so many interesting pictures,’ said photography expert Larry Silverman. He sees the influence of other photographers in her pictures and wonders if she developed her own style independently. ‘Was Vivian very sophisticated or did she take ideas from others?’ Maloof often wonders if he’ll ever go through all the negatives, which he keeps in three tall, fireproof file cabinets. Interestingly, he had no real interest in photography until he found Maier’s work. Inspired by her photos, Maloof started taking his own pictures. ‘As I learned more about photography and looked at her work again, I realized it was the people and street scenes that mattered to her,’ he said. ‘There was so much more to this work than I thought, and I realized I had found something more important than I ever imagined. Now our goal is to make her name known. To get Vivian Maier into the history books.'"
27,"Text: 'When a novel is called ambitious, it often means it didn't fully succeed. But this is not true for Eleanor Catton’s book, The Luminaries. I interviewed her in the UK when the book was very popular, but she was calm, even though she was still in her twenties. She had just come from Germany and was going back to New Zealand the next day. She shared a story about being stopped at passport control and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed her novel to the officer, who asked, ‘What’s it about?’ This is not an easy question for an author. The Luminaries is set in the 1860s in New Zealand. There are a series of crimes, and 12 men meet to solve them. The story becomes very complex. Catton said she wanted to write a murder mystery, not a historical novel, but found the past gave more chances for complications for her characters. The book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters enough attention. When I asked how it feels to be successful at a young age, she said, ‘It’s nice coming from a small country because everyone feels the success is partly theirs. There’s a family feeling at home, and I got a lot of support from other people’s grandmas.’ She added, ‘What is annoying is when people think I’m not trying to do something philosophical in the book.’ Catton wanted to write the book in the shape of a spiral, with each part half the length of the one before. It speeds up as it goes. I asked if it matters if the reader notices this. ‘I wanted to create a book with patterns that didn’t matter, but if you cared, you could see them,’ she said. Despite the experimental structure, The Luminaries is an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot. Surprisingly, she didn’t plan the story beforehand. ‘I would write myself into a corner and then see how imaginative I could be to get out of it,’ she said. It’s clear she also wanted the book to be fun for the reader. We talked about her love of TV drama series. Thinking of how The Luminaries uses cliff-hangers and different viewpoints, I asked if she might be interested in screenwriting. ‘That could be pretty cool,’ she said. Her conversation is full of enthusiasm, with a low, secretive laugh. She becomes animated when talking about her work and New Zealand. ‘I notice when I come to Britain how my imagination changes just by being in a different place. I see why writers move away from New Zealand to busy areas, to be around many people.’ But for now, New Zealand will continue to be her home. I hope it gives her the inspiration for many more novels.'"
28,"Text: 'As a boy, when Jonny Kinkead wasn’t using the tools in his dad’s garage, he was playing with a guitar. These two interests have been his job for the past forty years: making steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand. ‘I’m still fascinated by the guitar,’ he says. ‘How can you create a beautiful sound by just putting together two pieces of wood? And by using different types of wood, you get different sounds? Even now, it amazes me.’ Jonny learned to play his brother’s guitar when he was eleven. Then, at sixteen, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. ‘Some people would get a holiday job and save up for one,’ he says. ‘But I thought if you wanted something, you made it yourself. I studied guitars and learned how different shapes and types of wood affected the sound, and how to put them together.’ Although the bass was the first instrument Jonny built from scratch, he and his brothers had been doing similar things with other items. ‘We drew model boats and airplanes and then built them, so I knew the process. My father taught us how to use saws, sharpen chisels, and things like that. I’d also been fixing and customizing instruments for my friends.’ Jonny’s bass guitar turned out well, but he hadn’t thought about a career in building guitars. ‘I was also interested in painting and sculpture,’ he says. His interests changed, and after finishing school, he chose to study architecture at university. ‘Architecture involves design, which I liked, and being an architect seemed like a good idea at the time,’ he remembers. Halfway through the course, however, he left. ‘I was too individualistic for it,’ he says. ‘But I left with a clearer idea of what I wanted to do. I was still into sculpture, but I realized that guitar-building is a type of sculpture – one that involves shaping sound. And I thought it might be more practical than pure art because you’re making things people use.’ Since then, Jonny has made guitars for a living. For the first ten years, he also cleaned windows part-time. The first guitars he sold only covered the cost of the materials, but as he became known as one of the best guitar-makers, he could charge a bit more. But even now, almost forty years later, Jonny says he is ‘still just getting by’. He admits he can never make more than ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. In the early years, the key was to make an effort to get known. He would go to music festivals most weekends and get musicians to try his guitars and talk about him to their friends. He also had to learn how to price his instruments – when it came up in conversations with musicians, he didn’t have an answer because focusing on such things didn’t come naturally to him. Jonny believes developing a career is easier for today’s new guitar-makers in the UK. ‘When I started, people thought the only good acoustic guitars were made in the USA,’ he says. ‘UK-made guitars weren’t seen as the real thing, even though we’ve always had good instrument-making courses here and the skills have stayed pretty much the same. But now the quality of our hand-made guitars is recognized.’ Jonny says that valuable techniques can be learned in the classroom, and he thinks new instrument-makers should take the courses available. He also feels, however, that there is no substitute for trial and error. ‘The thing to do is to look at other instruments, see where people have succeeded or failed, and try different things,’ Jonny says. ‘If you make the back too thin or too thick, it won’t sound good. If you’re taught by someone else, you only learn one way, but if you’re self-taught, like I was, you learn everything.’'"
29,"Text: 'Any discussion about English conversation must start with the weather. This is a tradition, and like many writers on Englishness, I will quote the famous comment by Dr. Johnson, an eighteenth-century diarist: ‘When two Englishmen meet, their first talk is of the weather’. This observation is still true today. However, many people stop here or try to explain why English people are 'obsessed' with the weather, but they often fail. They fail because they think that when English people talk about the weather, they are really interested in it. For example, the American writer Bill Bryson says that English weather is not interesting, so the obsession is hard to understand: ‘To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it. All those exciting weather events like tornadoes and blizzards are almost unknown in the British Isles.’ The English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees with Bryson and says that English weather is interesting because it is unpredictable. ‘Bryson misses the point. The English interest in the weather is not about strong emotions. It is about its uncertainty. You can never be sure what you are going to get.’ My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the point. Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather. English weather-talk is a kind of code to help English people talk to each other. Everyone knows that phrases like ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ or ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ are not really about the weather. They are greetings, conversation starters, or fillers. English weather-talk is like ‘grooming talk’ – similar to how monkeys groom each other to bond socially. There are specific times when weather-talk is used. Some writers say the English talk about the weather all the time, but this is not true. There are three main situations for weather-talk: as a greeting, as an ice-breaker to start other conversations, or as a ‘default’ topic when there is an awkward silence. This means there is a lot of weather-talk, so outsiders think English people talk about nothing else. An English conversation may start with a weather greeting, use more weather-talk to break the ice, and then return to weather-talk if needed. It is easy to see why people from other countries, and even some English people, think that English people are obsessed with the weather.'"
30,"Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian’s Wall in Britain, trying to explain to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds what an amazing engineering achievement it was for the Romans to build something 120 km long and 5 meters high about 1900 years ago. The students were already interested because they chose this trip over more glamorous tours to Spain, Greece, or France. But they really wanted to know why the wall was built, and Alice felt her answers were not good enough. When she couldn't find a suitable historical novel to add context and interest to life at the Wall in Roman times, she decided to write one herself. After retiring from teaching after 31 years, Alice started a new career as an author in 2001. 

Alice felt she had taken a big step into the unknown. ‘Teaching is like acting; it’s giving a performance every day and is really physically demanding. Writing is exciting and a bit scary, but it’s not as exhausting. My former teaching colleagues envy me because I’m still in touch with children through my fiction.’ Alice says her main goal for her novels is to fill a gap in today’s children’s fiction. ‘A lot of adolescent fiction these days deals with negative experiences. It is very well written,’ she adds, ‘but a lot of it is dark reality; or there is total fantasy, like Harry Potter. My books are neither.’ 

Alice always tried to teach English and History as related subjects – lessons about ancient Greece alongside the novel Tale of Troy – and is motivated by her love of children. ‘I’m very interested in that moment when a child goes from being bored to interested and then from not understanding to understanding. I love having bored children because then the game is on. It’s all up to me to make it work at that point.’ She sees her writing as an extension of teaching. Although she was inspired to write her first novel because there was a gap in the market, the idea also came from the ‘empty nest’ as her two sons were leaving home, and a suggestion from her head teacher that she would enjoy a creative writing course. Alice was surprised. ‘I’d been teaching for 25 years. She said it would be good for me. But I didn’t want to spend my summer holiday doing a course I didn’t think was necessary.’ 

Before she was accepted on the course, she had to send the tutors her best piece of fiction, which she found out only a few days before she was due to leave. ‘I sat down at the computer and immediately invented a story of a Roman couple and their baby-to-be.’ Three hours and 30 pages later, she sent it in and was accepted immediately. During the course, the other students analyzed her piece as it progressed, gave her excellent reviews, and suggested she get it published. With 8,000 report cards as the only evidence of her writing ability apart from that one story, she asked the head teacher of her school for a year off to write her first novel. It helps Alice that her husband is the critic and editor Zachary Leader – his help in editing the novel was key. Alice says, ‘My mother-in-law thinks we’re now rival authors, but I think we complement each other. He works with what I’ve got on the page – he reads a chapter and changes the sentence structure, and if it’s not working, he suggests changing the words. My instinct is to keep on adding another scene. That’s the difference between a fiction writer and an editor or critic.’"
31,"Text: 'To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, who are champion triathletes, to take part in a special race. The race would be man against car, and brother against brother. In the wild and mountainous Yorkshire Dales of northern England, Jonny and his younger brother Ali would race to the same point. Jonny would drive a car on roads, while Ali would ride a mountain bike across the countryside. ‘I’m looking forward to it,’ Jonny said, as the brothers got ready at the start line. ‘I’ve never done anything like this before: it’s exciting! These roads have beautiful views – and also it’s very cold right now, so I’ll be able to sit in the car and stay nice and warm.’ Alistair was also eager – though unlike Jonny, who wore jeans and a sweatshirt, he was dressed in full winter cycling gear. The cold didn’t bother him. ‘To be honest,’ he said, ‘I’ve seen his driving before, so I’m not sure he’s even going to make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.’ The race started at the beautiful Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and was to finish at Yorkshire’s highest road, Fleet Moss, about 350 meters up. No problem for the car, perhaps – but with Alistair’s first couple of miles involving a 25 percent incline, the older Brownlee brother had a tough start. They barely had time for a quick handshake before they were off. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, heading for a track going straight up the hill and then across the countryside to Fleet Moss, Jonny jumped in the car and was soon on the road. The next time the brothers would see each other would be at the finish line. The only question was, who would get there first? Jonny’s early confidence was quickly challenged. Barely 15 seconds into the drive, he faced his first obstacle. A giant tractor came out of a field and onto the road. ‘Welcome to Yorkshire,’ he complained to the cameraman in the back of his car. ‘If Alistair beats me, it’s all because of this farmer!’ After tense moments, the tractor was out of the way, and Jonny was back in control, driving into the morning mist. Alistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the slope. Barely a couple of miles in, and as his brother relaxed, he had to get off and carry his bike up the hill, past walls and over fences. Sheep watched as the Olympic champion kept a steady pace, carrying his bike. Finally, he reached the top. On the other side was open ground, and with the sun coming out, he had a chance to show his skills. Head down, feet on the pedals, Alistair was picking up speed. In the car, Jonny faced another local obstacle. The villages in this part of Yorkshire have been there since before cars were invented – and the roads that link them were not made for speed. Jonny tried to get through another very narrow corner. The car slowed to a crawl, then passed through a stream on the road. Clear of the last village, the car was on a straight race to the finish line. Neither brother knew how close the other was. As Jonny sped through the final straight to Fleet Moss, Alistair was flying across his last field and back onto the road himself – approaching the finish from the other side. Head down, legs pumping… and then a squeal of brakes as he reached the line. And then, finally, Alistair looked up. ‘Is he here?’ he asked the waiting crowd. ‘No? Really?’ He raised his arms in victory. ‘Yes!’ Minutes later, the car pulled up and Jonny stepped out. ‘Well done,’ Jonny said with disappointment. ‘I’m gutted.’'"
32,"Text: 'The silence is what you notice when you play on Centre Court at the Wimbledon tennis championships. You bounce the ball quietly on the soft grass; you toss it up to serve; you hit it and hear the echo of your shot. The trimmed grass, the rich history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all make you feel separated from the outside world. The quiet of Centre Court helps my game. In a tennis match, I try hard to focus only on the game and the point I’m playing. The silence is broken by noise when a point ends: applause, cheers, people shouting your name. I hear them, but it feels distant. I don’t notice the fifteen thousand people watching every move my opponent and I make. I am so focused that I forget there are millions watching me around the world as I play Roger Federer in the 2008 Wimbledon final – the biggest match of my life. I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle Toni, my lifelong coach, taught me from a young age that this was the most important tournament. By the time I was 14, I was telling my friends I’d play there one day and win. Before 2008, I played and lost, both times against Federer – in the final the year before, and the year before that. The 2006 defeat wasn’t so hard. I was just happy to have made it that far at twenty. Federer beat me easily, more easily than if I’d believed in myself more. But losing in 2007 left me very upset. I knew I could have done better, and it wasn’t my skill that failed me, but my mind. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing always hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and lose it. Toni, a tough coach, usually doesn’t comfort me; he criticizes me even when I win. I must have been very upset because he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and finals. I told him he didn’t understand, that this might have been my last chance to win. I know how short a professional athlete’s career is, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more, and I let a big one pass in 2007. Toni couldn’t ease my sadness. Yet he was right. Another chance came in 2008, just one year later. I was confident I’d learned from that defeat; that my mind would not fail me this time. The best sign that my mind was ready was my belief that I would win. At dinner with family and friends the night before the final, at the house we rent when I play at Wimbledon, we didn’t talk about the match. I didn’t forbid them from mentioning it, but they knew I was already playing the match in my mind. From then until the start of play, that space was mine alone.'"
33,"Text: 'A young, idealistic Englishwoman arrived in Africa in April 1957. In one of her first letters home, she wrote, ‘I am living in the Africa I have always longed for, always felt stirring in my blood.’ She spent most of her life in Africa and became known as a citizen, journalist, scientist, activist, and environmentalist. Her name was Jane Goodall. In 1963, Britain’s National Geographical Society made Jane Goodall famous with articles and TV documentaries about her chimpanzee research. Her fame grew with her own writing, including award-winning children’s books and the 1971 bestseller In the Shadow of Man, translated into 47 languages. Jane Goodall is one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century, possibly only second to Marie Curie. Ironically, her fame might have overshadowed her real achievements. Many articles, interviews, and books tell her life story, but they often focus on her adventurous spirit or her dreams of living with wild animals, rather than her scientific work. These images can undervalue her true contributions. Based on the number of references to her research, the success of her students, and the data from her forty-year study, Jane Goodall should be seen as a leading pioneer in her field and a top zoologist. Her main achievement is that she helped us understand the social and emotional lives of chimpanzees. Before her work, people misunderstood the dangers of wild chimpanzees. No one knew they ate meat or used tools. We didn’t realize they shared emotions with humans or had social systems like ours. We also didn’t know that chimpanzee communities had different cultural traditions. Her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe (1986), is the most important work in this area. Her study of wild apes in Gombe, Nigeria, is considered one of the great scientific achievements. Jane Goodall changed how we study animals and how we think about ourselves, as chimpanzees are our closest relatives. Even as a child, there were signs of who Jane Goodall would become. One clear sign was in 1939, when she was five years old. One day, Jane disappeared, and the police were called. After a long search, she reappeared with straw in her hair. Her mother asked where she had been. Jane said she wanted to know how hens lay eggs, so she hid in a henhouse for five hours to find out. This curiosity can be seen as the start of her career as a biologist.'"
34,"During our first hour-long conversation, Shirley Ford talks to me using different voices: a cheeky 8-year-old boy, the boy’s tired mother, a funny elderly Scottish woman, and a very fast-talking alien. Her voices are familiar to people who watch children’s TV and cartoons, and to those who have seen computer programs about health and safety. ‘I’ve just done a voiceover about back injuries,’ she says, ‘so I had to quickly learn how to say lots of medical terms.’ Shirley explains what it takes to do voiceovers. ‘Many actors think they can do funny voices, and many probably can,’ she says. ‘But there’s more to it. You have to make the script come alive for an audience who can’t see you. You wouldn’t believe how many famous people want to do voiceover work. Producers invite them to auditions for publicity, but often they don’t get the parts because they’re used to acting with their whole bodies.’

After school, Shirley took a drama course, planning a regular acting career. During the course, she sometimes sang jingles for TV adverts. ‘One day,’ she says, ‘the man who ran the recording studio suggested I try out for the part of a rabbit in a cartoon. It seemed silly – I hadn’t studied drama to play rabbits – but I tried it for fun and, amazingly, got a major part.’ Shirley realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be her path. ‘Things just happened for me,’ she says. ‘In my second film, I was lucky to play the main character – and her brother and mother.’

Adult female actors often provide voices for small boys and girls. Their voices are lighter than male actors, and hiring child performers involves complex procedures and many forms, which production companies on tight schedules prefer to avoid. Shirley has learned to create the right sounds from the back of her throat, and to avoid always sounding like the same child, she collects new voices by watching children’s TV. Cartoons are the highlight of a job that includes educational videos and vacuum cleaner adverts. ‘Those are hard because you have to sound excited about something you don’t care about, but my years in this profession help,’ she says. ‘They’ve taught me that the trick is to smile while you're talking – that makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. When I have days doing animation work, it feels like a holiday; interacting with other actors makes a big difference.’

The competition for work is tough, and a good showreel – a recording showing what the artist can do – is essential. ‘It’s definitely worth investing in a strong showreel,’ Shirley says. ‘There are agencies that help voiceover artists put them together.’ She claims to have reached the top of her profession through persistence as much as talent. ‘Whether it’s making your showreel and taking it to all the film and TV companies, advertising agencies, and recording studios, or simply practicing your voices, it’s all about setting goals and not giving up.’

For anyone thinking about a career in voiceovers, Shirley recommends attending ‘specialist workshops – they cover all types of voiceover.’ She also believes a passion for human sound is important, describing herself as obsessed with voices and, in a way, becoming the characters she performs. ‘If I’ve been in the studio doing a particular kind of American voice, for example, it can take over me and I’ll be speaking like that for hours, maybe even days afterwards,’ she says. ‘My children have grown up used to their mum talking in completely different voices.’"
35,"People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. This makes sense because cartooning is a job many dream about as kids, like being a race car driver. However, most people eventually choose more realistic jobs, like becoming a tax lawyer or making car parts. The idea of making a living by drawing doodles, like those in school notebooks, seems silly. Yet, some people do it. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have wanted to do it for a long time. For me, after a typical cartoonist’s childhood (loving comic strips, drawing for school publications, being known as ‘the kid who draws’), I studied graphic design in college. After graduating, I showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find someone at a newspaper who needed political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas, they bought them, and in a few months, I was earning enough to support myself. 

To become a cartoonist, you don’t need a university degree, much money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But if it were that easy, there would be as many cartoonists as teachers. The technical barriers are low, but it’s still a tough job. No one should try to become a cartoonist unless they feel they can't do anything else. It’s easier to get a regular job that pays the rent and leaves time for family and hobbies. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I’ve done political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I’ve also been a writer, a caricaturist, and sometimes a designer. I don’t turn down any work because you can learn a lot from jobs you don’t really want to do. It also helps to be smart, well-read, and curious about everything.

What about the business side of being a cartoonist? There was a time when many cartoonists could find regular jobs doing cartoons for newspapers and magazines. But those days are almost over. Today, cartooning is mostly an entrepreneurial activity – you have to create and sell your work. The more comfortable you are with this, the better you’ll do. I’ve seen cartoonists with average talent and great business skills do better than artistic geniuses with no business sense. It surprises me how often I meet people who have never sold a cartoon but are afraid someone will steal their ideas. Some are so worried they won’t let others see their work! Legally, to protect your work, you just need to draw a little ‘c’ for ‘copyright’, put a circle around it, and write your name and the date next to it. But honestly, it’s more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal a cartoon and it goes viral online, it’s not a disaster – it can be a very lucky break!"
36,"Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and decided to get rid of some things. One of these was an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. It was a sleek, black, Japanese-made guitar. I usually hate throwing things away, so why did I want to throw this away? I took it to the rubbish dump and was about to throw it on a pile of trash when a young man came up to me, looking confused. He asked, ""You’re not just going to throw that away, are you?"" I said I was, already feeling a bit of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I said yes. We went our separate ways. In the years that followed, I often regretted my decision. Then, a few months ago, I received an email that changed everything. It reminded me of a story about a man who lost his wedding ring in the ocean and found it years later in a fish. The email was from someone I didn’t know, a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He said, ""I’ve got your electric guitar."" The guitar had been bought and sold several times since I gave it away. Keith found a name-and-address label on the back and used my name to find me online. He contacted me through the newspaper I work for and offered to sell it back to me. I was so emotional. I would have paid anything, but his price was fair. I had forgotten my dad’s habit of putting name-and-address stickers on everything, including my guitar. My dad would have laughed at this story! My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar in the 1970s when it was popular. I loved its calming sound, but I didn’t make much progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar, playing simple music. It was also the time of punk music, where you didn’t need to play well to be a rock star. When I got my guitar back from Keith, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and smaller than I remembered. I felt the need to stand up and play it with a strap over my shoulder. My fingers remembered the chords, even though I couldn’t draw them. My fingertips felt the pain of pressing the strings. The electric guitar is not really for playing alone. Now that I’m learning it again, maybe I’ll form a band. My son is learning the saxophone; maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are others like me. We could call ourselves ‘The Regainers’!"
37,"There has been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote the book ""Insomniac,"" about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not getting enough sleep and how it affects our minds, bodies, and moods. As any person who struggles with sleep will tell you (and I spoke to many), sleep is very important for our mental, physical, and social health. It seems that those who have trouble sleeping understand best how important it is. So, it's good that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about them in the conversation. We often lose dreams. When you wake up early, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep, you mainly lose REM or 'Rapid Eye Movement' sleep, which is the stage with the most dreams. Our most vivid and emotional dreams happen during REM, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep in REM, so someone who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM. When researchers stop people from having REM sleep, they have more and stronger REM sleep the next night to make up for it. This suggests that dreams are important. When researchers found REM in 1953, many agreed with the famous psychologist Sigmund Freud, who said that understanding dreams was the best way to understand our minds. But it wasn't that simple. Later research on the brain didn't support this idea. The study of dreams shifted to looking at their physical origins instead of psychological ones. Currently, there is not much agreement among dream researchers, says Harvard University sleep scientist Robert Stickgold. Dreams are important. At a meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Society, P.F. Pagel from the University of Colorado Medical School talked about a study that found actors, writers, and directors are better at remembering and using dreams than people at his sleep center. He concluded that people use dreams more if they are interested in creativity. It makes sense that filmmakers have a strong connection with their dreams because films are very dream-like. But I wondered, are creative people the only ones who can use their dreams? Doesn't everyone – like teachers, software designers, and politicians – need to think creatively? Dreams, Stickgold says, help us connect things in new and surprising ways, using knowledge from the past and present to find new ideas. Dreams might help us see new patterns and create combinations that break our usual ways of thinking. For example, Stickgold found that when people are woken up from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when woken from other sleep stages. They 'ignore the obvious and put together things that make a kind of unexpected sense ... This is what creativity is,' says Stickgold. I write better when I wake up from intense dreams. Even a troubling dream, even one you can barely remember, seems to help with thinking. On those days, words and images come so quickly that my fingers can barely keep up. I don't know how it works, but it does. But creativity isn't just for writers or artists. We live in a complex world. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly as we deal with relationships with colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends. This is why we need to dream."
38,"Susie Ray moved from London to a small coastal town in south-west England twenty years ago. In her studio, which has a beautiful sea view, there are empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters. Susie is a leading artist in the copyist art movement, known for her ability to recreate the richness of early-20th century impressionist paintings and the brilliance of 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. Despite her talent, she doesn't keep her own work because they are in high demand. Over her 30-year career, she has copied works by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that even art experts can mistake them for the originals. While the originals are worth millions, her copies sell for between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on them. Susie’s clients include galleries and private collectors, but she keeps their names private. Some collectors use her copies to save on insurance by keeping the original in a bank safe. Susie is honest about her work and always signs her name on the back of the canvas. She knows that selling a copy as an original is illegal and has never been tempted to do so. Although she has faced financial struggles, her situation is more stable now, and she values her reputation. Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, which paid very little but taught her accuracy. She advises young artists to learn to draw well and to study hard. Susie specializes in French impressionists like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. She believes that modern art, like impressionism, is more challenging than it seems because it requires both speed and precision. Although Susie has tried creating her own art, she prefers copying because it suits her perfectionist nature."
39,"During her racing days, nothing was more important to Ellen MacArthur than the sea, except maybe being the fastest on it. She was obsessed with sailing since she was a child. She felt a special connection with the boats that took her around the world. They worked together as one. When she returned to land, everyday life seemed unimportant, and people asked too many questions about the race. She quickly wanted to be back on the ocean, challenging herself against nature, even in dangerous places. After she came second in the Vendée Globe, a non-stop, solo round-the-world race, she showed me her boat, Kingfisher. It was her home and workplace for 94 days. She explained how she carefully planned everything, even the number of kitchen paper rolls she needed. Preparation was crucial, she said. She proudly showed her stock of freeze-dried food, the small gas stove, and the neatly organized medical supplies. The boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, she sees the world like a boat: small, beautiful, and fragile, with limited resources. Her perspective changed during a trip to South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic, where she helped with a bird survey on albatrosses. She realized things she hadn't thought about before. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her think about how humans take what they want and move on. When I visited Ellen’s office, she was finishing a conference call. She explained why we must act now to save the planet. ""No one is making more coal, oil, or gas. They are precious resources we have only once. We need to find a way not to use them up."" At first, her message was to use less, but then she saw things differently. Now she talks about re-using, like reusable industrial carpet tiles. For the last three years, she has visited factories, mines, and power stations, speaking to governments and businesses about our dependence on non-renewable resources. ""I will never be an expert,"" she says, ""but I love learning. The current situation is something I can't ignore. Sailing seemed selfish compared to this. This is about finding how my voice can be most useful. It really matters.""

She also started the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works with businesses and education to help young people rethink and redesign a sustainable future. ""I do miss the adventure of being at sea,"" she says. ""It is part of who I am. You are connected to everything around you. You don't have time to feel lonely. You focus on the record, on practical things, on survival. My new message is not as simple as saying, 'I’m going to be the fastest person around the world.' I may have been the fastest, but this is more important than anything I've ever done."""
40,"Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he could become very famous. Many young people spend a lot of time on computers and video games, so Jordan hopes to inspire them to go outside and try new things. His climbing team includes his father, Paul, and his mother, Karen. They call themselves ‘Team Romero’. Climbing Everest is just one part of their goal. If Jordan climbs Everest and Vinson Massif in Antarctica, he will be the youngest person to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent. Not many people do this before they are thirty. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish before he turns 20.

I talked to some experienced Everest climbers, and none of them thought it was a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the world’s highest mountain. They agreed that a young climber might be physically strong enough, but they were not sure if a teenager would be emotionally ready. They also doubted that a young person could have enough experience to make safe decisions while climbing. The Romeros have heard these opinions before. Paul says, ‘I know people criticize us, but I can’t focus on that – there’s still a lot to do. Karen and I think about the risks all the time, but we believe our experience as climbers will help. Watching Jordan grow gives me confidence. He’s becoming strong and mature.’

I also wonder why Jordan wants to do this. Is it just his father pushing him too far? Paul says, ‘This isn’t about me trying to be famous because of my son. At first, Jordan talked about doing this later, but we thought: ‘Why not now?’ We regularly check with him to make sure he still wants to do it.’ When I ask Jordan what he enjoys about the challenge, he says, ‘I just focus on achieving my goal.’

In the past, not many people cared about being the youngest or fastest to climb a mountain or sail an ocean. Today, every adventure is shared online, and every climb becomes a record-setting challenge. The more exciting the record, the more people are interested. This gives Jordan a problem. People might say that focusing on records takes away the fun, but if Jordan wants to inspire others, he has to be in the media. This means blogging, taking photos, and giving interviews. He has to do something amazing, like climbing Everest. ‘And you know what?’ Paul says. ‘If Jordan decides he wants to stop climbing and play basketball instead, we’ll stop this project and go to the gym.’"
41,"Text: 'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be pretty sure they’re not listening to classical music. Most of us can name many pop groups, but if you ask my friends who Brahms was, they probably won’t know. I have just started a music degree, but the people in my course don’t know more about classical music than others our age. If you don’t know who wrote the music, you probably don’t own any recordings of it. The statistics must be sad for a lover of classical music. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies. I still find that hard to believe. So, why has interest in this type of music, which has lasted for centuries, declined? The older generation blames our obsession with TV and video games, but I don’t think that’s the reason. The simple truth is that classical music doesn’t attract most people, especially teenagers, who are the ones most likely to buy music and concert tickets. I know some teenagers who go to classical music concerts, but they are a minority. Although I am a musician and play in an orchestra, I’m not a big classical music fan. I enjoy many styles, but judging by what’s on my computer, my classical music listening is probably close to that 3% figure. So why don’t teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Also, experts say we have trouble paying attention for more than about three minutes; too short for most classical pieces, but perfect for a pop song. Pop is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and focus. The topics of pop music are more appealing than a long classical piece with no lyrics. Classical music is powerful, but not full of the issues that concern teenagers. The way we listen to music has also changed. In the past, families would gather at home to make music together, and playing an instrument was important. The only other way to hear music was at a concert. Now, you can find any music you want online, but the soundtrack to our lives is rarely classical. When did you last go into a shop that had classical music playing? One of my teachers says that audiences at classical concerts have increased recently. Maybe, but I bet not many of those new audience members are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in many places, but no matter how cool the posters are, I see mostly grey hair in the crowd. I don’t know why people like classical concerts more in middle age, but I do know that if you’re a teenager and your parents love something, you’ll probably try to avoid it. Some say the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers is the fault of our schools, but many kids are eager to play classical music in their school orchestra. They arrive early to practice and stay after school to rehearse. Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but otherwise, it is not their music of choice. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, it’s always pop music.'"
42,"Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother’s car and looked at Almonside School. ""I’ll make you sorry I’ve come here,"" she said to herself. Her mother was getting out of the other side of the car and didn’t hear her, but Bonnie didn’t mind. Her mother already knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside was a strange school, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside; it was confusing at first. Then she saw the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre… ""Riding centre,"" said Bonnie, suddenly interested. ""Headmaster’s study,"" said her mother. ""This way."" Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. ""I wish you’d walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,"" said Mrs. Wyndham tiredly, but she didn’t expect Bonnie to change. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to Bonnie’s new headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Suddenly, Bonnie stood up. ""Why should I just sit here?"" she thought. ""I’ll be thrown out soon anyway,"" she thought to herself, ""so why not get it over with?"" She left the building and went towards the riding centre, following the sign. There was an old building for the horses and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. They were well cared for, she could see that right away. Almost every stall had a horse, and she walked along, looking at each one. ""I know what they’re doing here,"" she told a small pony as she touched its nose. The next horse surprised her. ""Aren’t you the best of the lot!"" she said. He was brown with a bit of white. Lively, probably, but Bonnie liked that. ""I feel like we’ve met before,"" said Bonnie, stroking his neck. ""In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition…"" His name was Maverick. Suddenly, she wanted to ride him. ""I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle for you. They can’t be far."" The room with the riding equipment was unlocked, to Bonnie’s delight. Focused on putting a saddle on Maverick, she forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on the big horse outside, she felt like a queen. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. ""You’re the best horse I’ve ever ridden, Maverick,"" she said, ""and I mean it, because I know about horses, even if I don’t know about anything else."" She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. ""If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,"" she said. She rode around the paddock. The rhythm was exciting, and the breeze made her cheeks glow. She felt Maverick trusted her, and she was sure he’d jump well."
43,"Cody Simpson is a 15-year-old Australian who has become famous for his music. He has released many successful songs. But how did he go from being a relaxed surfer to performing on stage for thousands of fans? Cody explains, ""I first picked up a guitar when I was six and started writing songs at seven."" At that time, he was also swimming and surfing every day, which were his main interests. When he was 13, he posted some videos online of himself singing at a school concert. These videos changed his life. Fans loved them and asked for more. Cody recorded more videos at home and shared them online. The response was amazing.

Cody was also a talented swimmer, training with top coaches. But when record labels showed interest, he had to make a difficult decision: stay in Australia to continue swimming or move to the US to pursue music. Cody chose music. ""It was very hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose a career,"" he says. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. ""It was a big surprise to most people,"" he recalls.

Cody moved to the US with his family, leaving one dream behind to follow another. His family stays out of the spotlight but supports him from the background. Cody believes it's important to have supportive people around you. He sometimes worries about how his decision affects his younger brother and sister, especially his eight-year-old brother who travels and studies on the road. But his family reassures him of their support.

Cody's success shows that saying ""yes"" to opportunities, even when they are scary, is important. ""Everything happened so fast,"" Cody says. ""Now, I visit countries I never thought I would and perform for many fans. It's a dream for many people, but I know it won't last forever."""
44,"I jumped out of bed, lifted a corner of the bedroom curtain, and looked at the river bend. A new crack in the ice shone in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the wall of sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still hurt from lifting them into place. Last week, I worked with most of the town’s adults for long hours, showing I could do it. Not that my grandfather noticed much. With one hand still on the curtain, I looked along the half-mile of steaming black water from the wood processing factory in Milltown. With fragile ice on both sides, the dark open patch was followed by solid ice downstream. As I took off my pajamas and reached for my kayaking wetsuit, I saw a boy on the far side of the river. A boy I didn’t recognize. I frowned. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf along the water warmed by the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and reached for my kayaking jacket. I checked the pocket for the lucky chain I keep there – a silver chain my famous grandfather once brought back from a trip to South America. Better than having a famous grandfather is having this chain, which only he, my mom, and I know about. Plus, I have the diary he kept on that journey. I keep it under my pillow and read parts of it before I fall asleep. I patted the chain again and went to the kitchen. ‘Morning, Rex.’ Mom smiled at me as I grabbed a banana from the kitchen counter. ‘You’re up early for a Saturday. I’ll make brunch after your training session. Be careful, now.’ ‘Thanks, Mom.’ I headed down the hallway, almost bumping into Grandpa as he stepped out of his bedroom. ‘Can’t you watch where you’re going?’ he shouted. ‘Where are you going, anyway?’ ‘Sorry, Grandpa. I’m going kayaking.’ As if my wetsuit didn’t make that obvious. As if he didn’t see me in my kayak every morning. Grandpa is Grandpa, and I try to ignore it when he gets angry, but it’s getting harder. ‘What’s the point of training? You didn’t win the competition,’ he said. For a moment, his sharp words hurt like he wanted them to. But I took a deep breath and counted to three. He crossed the hall and slammed the bathroom door. Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile. ‘Don’t mind him. He’s…’ ‘…not himself at the moment,’ I finished for her. I didn’t say that he’d always been that way. But, like Mom, I try to be patient with him. When I was a child, he was my hero – from the time he first showed me photos of him in National Geographic magazine. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, above his dusty expedition medals and trophies. But I don’t go into his room anymore. I have my own growing collection of trophies to look at and, maybe soon, my own face in National Geographic. And yet, a part of me still wants to stay devoted to him, this grumpy old man. Mom smiled. ‘At least he’s coming out of his bedroom more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep it up, even on these cold days!’ I smiled back at her as I peeled my banana. ‘It’ll be warmer in South America,’ I said. ‘If I find sponsors for my expedition.’ She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. Stepping into the backyard, I hurried towards the boathouse."
45,"Text: Mum caught Jess by the arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, leaning against the wall, was an unframed painting. It was clearly one of Grandpa's, but different from his usual work and not finished. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in the scene; not one she recognized, maybe not even a real one, just a fantasy river. The picture was strange and beautiful in a mysterious way. The riverbank was barely visible, just a hint of green, drawing the eye into the pale waters towards a hidden sea. There were no animals, birds, or people; it felt right that way. It seemed like there was no place for living things in this distant vision. Yet, Jess was fascinated, thinking of autumn coming after a long summer. Mum spoke again. ""It has a name."" Her voice sounded too casual, hiding her excitement. Jess understood why. Grandpa never named his pictures. He just painted them and let others interpret them. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. ""River Boy."" The words seemed important to her, but she didn't know why. There was another mystery. She looked at Mum. ""There is no boy."" ""Exactly. Strange, isn't it? For him to be so specific. Maybe he'll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum! You should have known better."" ""I know, but I couldn't resist. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. You can guess his response."" Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would have said. ""He told you it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and language, like a poem, and we either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard enough without having to explain it to everyone."" ""Ignoramus, he said."" ""… every ignoramus what it means. And if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they'd never get any work done. And he said …"" Mum interrupted, laughing. ""Something like that. Anyway, I hoped you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be a sort of muse for him."" ""Muse?"" ""Someone who inspires an artist."" She knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but usually to say the muse wasn't kind to him that day, or he had to be nice to the muse because he had a difficult part to work on. He never suggested the muse was her. She always thought he meant a goddess, not a person. And it was hard to imagine anyone, even a goddess, influencing someone as stubborn as Grandpa. ""He doesn't need me to inspire him,"" she said. ""He's been painting all his life."""
46,"Text: 'When I woke up this morning, I didn’t plan to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I’m not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. For example, if I had tripped over the bed with Dad’s Stanley knife in my hand, the blade might have cut the carpet by itself. I’m not saying that happened, just that it could have. I didn’t mean to damage the carpet. I didn’t wake up thinking, ‘Today I will cut a hole in my carpet.’ It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Later, you wonder why you thought that, but by then it’s too late. This happens to me a lot. I’m very unlucky that way. I was actually trying to find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. Gran gave me the cabinet when she moved to a flat. It’s really cute! It’s small, painted white, with pink and blue flowers, and has tiny glass doors. Gran used to keep china ornaments in it. I keep my collection of shells and fossils there. Gran knew I always loved her corner cabinet. I was so excited when she gave it to me! But it is a corner cabinet, shaped like a triangle, so it has to stand in a corner. I have only two corners in my bedroom because it’s the smallest room in the house, shaped like a wedge of cheese. The big front bedroom is Mum and Dad’s; the one at the back is my sister Angela’s; the little one over the garage is my brother Tom’s; and the tiny one is mine. Mum says when Angela goes to University, Tom can have her room and I can have his. And when Tom goes to University, I can choose. But since Angela is only fifteen, I think I’ll be in my tiny room for years. I don’t really mind; I like my little bedroom. It’s cosy, like a nest. I love the sloping roof and the window at floor level. The only problem is the lack of corners! My bed is in one, and my wardrobe in the other. I tried fitting Gran’s cabinet between the roof and the floor, but it was just a bit too tall. If I could only cut a couple of centimetres off the bottom of it... That’s when I had an idea. If I couldn’t cut the cabinet, how about cutting a hole in the carpet? It seemed like the obvious solution. What Dad calls lateral thinking. I thought he would be pleased with me. He always tells us to ‘think outside the box’. And that was exactly what I was doing!'"
47,"The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live hidden in the walls and floors of a house. They secretly 'borrow' things from normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV version of the novel, I knew it would be hard to meet people's expectations. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how everything should look. I used the original drawings from the book a lot because I didn't want people to say I got it wrong. The author wanted the series to show the Borrowers' point of view, not a human one, which made filming more complicated. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so if we filmed them walking across a room or going on a borrowing mission, we had to be 10 times further away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from no higher than 15 centimeters to get the Borrowers' perspective. They wore out many pairs of jeans! We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots. One big challenge was getting the shadows right when combining images of the tiny Borrowers with normal-sized backgrounds. We created a special technique for this. After the series was shown, the famous US film director George Lucas called to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was wonderfully surreal. When I asked them to carry things like a giant pair of scissors, they really got into it. I remember the coins - they were bigger than dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because they made the crew laugh so much. In the story, there’s a scene where the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, actors had to be swept down a tunnel with hoses and said it was so scary, they didn’t have to act at all. One important thing for me, which other directors struggled with, was getting the costumes right. I had them made from heavy canvas so they stuck out like dolls’ clothes. This made it hard for the lead actress to bend in her costume. She couldn’t sit during breaks and couldn’t take the dress off because she was sewn into it every morning. The lead actor's trousers were made from a rug because normal material would look too smooth. Unfortunately, the weather was really hot during filming. I don’t think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes! Most of the action away from the Borrowers’ home was shot with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene to show how each one should look – I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren’t accurate, but they worked well enough. The budget didn’t allow for time in special effects studios during the day, so I worked nights for three months. We had to work hard and fast – I once shot a whole scene before realizing there was no film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was successful in showing the magic of the books."

Let’s see how long it takes before the craziness starts. Because it will, you know. It always does. The fake smiles, the wannabe friends, the can-you-get-me-free-tickets-to-one-of-your-dad’s-concerts? ‘Everything’s going to be fine,’ I tell her. She kisses her fingertip and touches my cheek before I get out of the car. Then she drives away, leaving me alone with this new school and new situation. But this is what I wanted. To get away from my old life on the road and tour tutors. So while the rest of the band is renting here during the recording, we’re staying for good. I wanted to come to this school because I want to meet real kids for a change. How about a kid with a mom who works in an office? Or a dad who cuts grass? That’d be so cool. So normal. I walk into the school’s main office. ‘Hi, I need my schedule please,’ I tell the school secretary. ‘Name?’ She looks as friendly as an ice bucket. ‘Desert McGraw.’ ‘Desirée?’ she asks, leaning closer. ‘Desert,’ I repeat. The secretary seems confused. ‘Oh,’ she says and types ‘McGraw’ on her keyboard. That’s one good thing. Few people recognize my last name because my dad only uses his stage name. ‘What grade?’ ‘Eleventh.’ ‘One second, it’s printing,’ the secretary says. Then she hands me the paper. English Literature, first period. Cool, I can handle that. English has always been my favorite subject. I’ll be late, though. English is in Room 214, second floor. I studied the map the night before, so I wouldn’t look lost. When I get to the door, I hear the teacher already calling names. ‘Aurelio Gonzalez.’ ‘Here.’ She continues while I slip in quietly and sit at the last desk in the second row. The girl next to me smiles. Her eyes look at my normal and, I think, clever outfit – jeans and a T-shirt. Ha! Nobody will suspect me now! ‘Nice shoes,’ she whispers. I look down at my expensive shoes with the tan embroidered flowers. Oh no, I knew I shouldn’t have worn these. Dead giveaway. ‘Thanks,’ I say. The teacher pauses. ‘Desert... McGraw?’ she says slowly. ‘Here.’ The teacher smiles and introduces herself as Ms. Smigla. She talks a lot and gives us our course outlines. After we review them and she tells us about the books we need to read this year, she actually gives us time to talk! All teachers should do this. ‘So why’d you move here?’ my new friend asks. Let’s see, I have lots of choices here. Do I say it’s because I wanted a normal life away from cameras, reporters, and the red carpet? Or the real reason, according to Dad? ‘We need a change, Desert,’ he said, ‘and this is the perfect place to record the new album. Energy, color, culture... just what our last album needed.’ Personally, I think he just wants to relax on the beach. Why else would they have picked South Beach Sounds, a recording studio near the sand? ‘My dad had to relocate,’ I tell her. Yes, lies always work better. ‘What does he do?’ she asks. Oh, whatever. Everyone’s going to find out eventually, anyway. But at least I’ll have some time to pretend to be normal until they do. ‘He’s an artist,’ I say, playing with the zipper on my backpack. ‘Cool. I’m Becca, by the way.’ And she didn’t seem to care. Excellent.'"
49,"Text: 'Today, the average American teenage girl is expected to be the Student Council president, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what being an American teenager is like now. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and stay unnoticed, because being average is not enough. Not being ambitious is seen as laziness. ""People, often adults, forget how much pressure teenagers have these days. We have lots of homework, tests, extra activities, jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home, all while trying to have a social life,"" says teenager Kristen Loose. Even though these stresses are normal for teenagers today, negative stereotypes about them still exist, often spread by the media. You know the stereotypes: lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-centered. While some teenagers may fit these descriptions, it is not fair to say all teenagers are like this. ""Many people think we spend most of our time watching TV and using our cell phones,"" Loose says. Loose believes this is mostly wrong. She admits to having her cellphone nearby most of the time, but not just for fun. It is not only for texting friends; it is a tool that teens use to make their lives easier. Students today are expected to have quick access to the world and be reachable at all times, which can look like a cell phone addiction. With smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can now do their work anywhere. Instead of listening to music on the way to school, they could be listening to language lessons. Schoolwork and other activities no longer stop at the school gate but need 24-hour attention from already busy teens. Many teenagers start their days around 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and often end after midnight. Their schedule is full of school, after-school activities, family duties, and homework. Then, they have to get up and do it all again the next day, with less than the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. The US National Sleep Foundation found that about 20 percent of all teens get the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. Also, 28 percent of teens said they fall asleep in school about once a week because they are so tired. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen thinks that after all her activities, she gets about 18 hours of free time a week. With 168 hours in a week, 18 is not much. Olsen rarely spends those hours on social media or TV. Instead, she focuses on volunteer work. ""I think the stereotype of teenagers is that they only care about themselves and their own interests,"" Olsen says. Despite this image, Olsen says her favorite part of the week is volunteering. ""I love helping others and look forward to making a positive impact in my school and community during the week."" In 20 years, who knows what the stereotype for teenagers will be, but they will still be proving it wrong and pushing the world forward. There will be another generation of students who are changing the world, all before they finish school.'"
50,"The teenage members of the Earth to Sky Calculus Club live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US, east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. This group has launched over fifty balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth. It's a science project with a twist: part astronomy experiment, part adventure, which attracts teenagers. I join them one weekend in late spring. They are about to release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These happen when a rock or metal piece enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a light trail. As it gets dark, the teenagers attach a soft insulated $5 lunch box to the balloon. Inside is a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer. Two GPS trackers are on the outside to help find it later. A gas tank, donated by someone from a nearby state, inflates the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car. An older boy made a seven-hour trip to get it. ‘I didn’t really mind,’ he says. For kids in this club, that’s normal. Finally, it's time for lift-off. ‘Five, four, three, two, one,’ they chant, and the balloon rises. Some run and track it with flashlights, lighting up the balloon in the dark sky. There is quiet and a sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappears. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the clear sky, just four hours from Los Angeles, a busy city of about 4 million people. I see a boy get into a sleeping bag and fall asleep. ‘We're the only ones talking,’ says one girl quietly. ‘I know,’ whispers another. A meteor crosses the sky. As the balloon rises, the air pressure drops, and the balloon expands until it pops. A parachute helps the lunch box land safely. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. Getting it back isn’t easy, but that’s part of the fun. There is little inhabited land around Bishop, so the lunch box usually lands in remote areas. ‘To me, recoveries are a big part of the program,’ said the group’s leader, who notes they've lost only two lunch boxes in 53 launches. ‘Part of the journey is getting to know this landscape in a way you normally wouldn’t.’ This time, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, but to get it, the team had to drive south of the Sierra and then back up the western side. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as it could be dangerous if the lunch box was on a high peak or a tall tree. ‘These students are native to the Eastern Sierra,’ their leader says. ‘What seems wild to some is normal to others.’ It took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, on a flat rock, in a waterfall. The camera didn’t record any shooting stars. It’s a bit disappointing, but it’s a chance to discuss atmospheric waves and how they work above mountains. And it’s another adventure story to share."
51,"Chloe Morgan admits that science, especially Palaeontology, didn't interest her much until she was fifteen. It happened by chance. Her younger brother was interested in dinosaurs, a common phase for kids, which she hadn't gone through. She helped him with a science project and found an article about new discoveries in Palaeontology. It amazed her, and she knew she wanted to pursue it. 

I asked her about the support she received, as Palaeontology wasn't a common career choice for young people then. She remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already famous. She was nervous, even though he was known to be friendly. She worried he might find her annoying with her questions, but he was patient and willing to listen, which made her feel comfortable.

I mentioned how palaeontologists are shown in movies and TV shows. Chloe thinks films like Jurassic Park have increased interest in dinosaurs but not necessarily in Palaeontology. She feels that palaeontologists are often shown as either eccentric geniuses or awkward geeks, which isn't accurate. Her job is varied; she digs up dinosaur bones, works in labs analyzing fossils, and writes for scientific publications. She also communicates scientific findings to the public, which she finds important, especially for young people. She believes talking about dinosaurs can inspire children to learn about science.

Chloe worked on the TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, helping ensure the dinosaurs were shown accurately. She says the program attracted audiences of all ages because it showed dinosaurs in a new, realistic way, different from movies like Jurassic Park.

Chloe thinks dinosaurs fascinate us because they appeal to our sense of exploration and discovery. They remind us that there is still much to learn, and Palaeontology is like a form of time travel."
52,"Text: 'I’m just going to say this once: when you’re traveling by car with your family, even if you’re six years old, you probably know you’re not ‘there yet,’ even as you keep asking ‘Are we there yet?’ And really, once you get there, it’s not ‘there’ anymore, is it? It’s ‘here’. So if you think you might be ‘there,’ you should ask ‘Are we here yet?’ And I’m sure no one wants to be ‘there yet’ more than the mums and dads who hear that question over and over on long car trips. I mean, seriously – what are we kids complaining about? Just think about it. Wouldn’t you rather be relaxing in the back seat, with nothing to do? You can watch DVDs you haven’t seen before, listen to music, or do puzzles, while the scenery goes by outside the window. In the front seat, mum or dad is there to give out juice boxes and cookies, or change the radio station and temperature – basically, to keep everything running smoothly! Are we there yet? I hope not. That is, until someone in the car does something annoying – usually my younger brother, Tim. Like putting his foot on my side of the seat. What? He can’t do that! So I put my foot on his side. Then it’s his other foot, then a hand, and soon he’s in my space and we start fighting. The driver and co-pilot reach back to separate us as the car speeds up and swerves. They tell the younger sibling to stay in his own seat and keep his hands to himself. This calms things down for a while. And the beautiful scenery continues to pass by. Soon after, I’m trying to read, and I feel something – a breeze on my arm. But the car’s not going fast and the window’s not open. Where’s it coming from? My brother is in the next seat, quietly blowing on me. He’s on his side, not touching me – so he’s found a loophole. Just breathing? What’s wrong with that? The anger grows. Tim gets yelled at, there’s more swerving. Then slowly things calm down again – for now. Over the years, Dad has developed ways to deal with us kids in the back seat. For example, when we ask ‘Are we there yet?’ he often says, ‘Yup. We’re here. Get out of the car.’ ‘But Dad. We’re still on the highway, going 70 miles an hour.’ ‘Oh, well, then maybe we’re not there yet.’ That kept us quiet for a while. You know you’re finally ‘there’ when you see the grown-ups get out of the car and go as far away as they can from the kids who have bothered them for hours. So remember: if mum and dad are still close enough to answer your question, then the answer is: no. You’re not there yet.'"
53,"John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford, UK, where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They hope people will love the experience and come back. Zuzi explains that they wanted to create a place where people can connect without using technology. She says, ""Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to bring people together to communicate face-to-face.""

The games played in their café are called 'Eurogames'. These games have gentle themes like farming and building landscapes. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, now known as Catan, created by German designer Klaus Teuber. In this game, players build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone involved until the end. This idea was improved in 'co-operative' games, where players win or lose as a team, encouraging more social interaction. One popular co-operative game is Pandemic, created by North American designer Matt Leacock. In Pandemic, players work together to solve global problems. Leacock was inspired by a Eurogame called Lord of the Rings. He remembers playing it with friends and feeling excited, whether they won or lost. This inspired him to create games that bring people together.

Leacock loved board games as a child but often felt disappointed by them. With help from his uncle, he started designing better games. Pandemic became very successful, and its follow-up version included more storytelling. Leacock says it is like an electronic game where you develop characters and the story changes.

The growth of video games has helped the success of modern board games. Video games have made playing games more normal. Ben Hogg, from a leading games company, says, ""Everyone with a smartphone has at least one game they like to play."" Video games used to offer social interaction in arcades or with friends at home. But now, many video games are played online, where players are not physically together. This has led some people to look for games they can play with others in person.

John and Zuzi's café shows that tabletop gaming is more than just fun. In our online world, these games offer a way to connect with others in real life, and this trend is likely to continue."
54,"Jamie Scott has written and produced some of the biggest UK hits in recent years. His story shows why endurance and persistence are important in the music business, even if your career starts with many false beginnings. Jamie says his mother was a great singer and she helped him start playing the guitar. The only radio station he heard at home was for middle-aged people, which influenced him as he grew up. He says he was 12 before he heard a modern song. Around that time, he had to choose between tennis, which he played at a national level, and music. He spent his lunchtimes in the school music room playing the piano. ""With tennis, I was quite good,"" he says. ""But it wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It was just too much hard work."" At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He was in a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist but not as interested in a music career. ""I went to my parents and broke down,"" he recalls. ""I told them this is what I wanted to do, that I had been writing lyrics in economics lessons and playing the piano every day when others were outside."" His dad gave him 18 months to succeed; if not, he would have to find a job. After some close calls with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19 because of one song. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. In the end, he found success behind the scenes rather than on stage. After a tough time with a UK record label, he asked to leave and switched to another label to release a new album. Fame and fortune did not come. ""In my own artist career, I feel like I've been in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" he says. ""But as a writer, I've been in the right place at the right time."" Writing for others is where he truly succeeded. ""I like to think I'm one of the main writers in the UK that labels send new artists to,"" he says. This, he believes, helps start their careers. Sometimes he explains to the artists he helps that writing with the charts in mind is okay. ""Why not? Don't you want 10 million people streaming your music next month? I'm not saying they should write a bad song, but we should create something amazing that will also sell well."" It's refreshing to hear someone speak honestly about wanting to write big hits. Jamie is not arrogant; he just knows he wants to write number ones and has the talent to do it. Instead of worrying about what others think, he focuses on his goal. ""That's the goal when I go into the studio with someone,"" he says. ""We need to aim for global success and write the best music of next year. It's not just about being cool. We want to write classic modern pop songs."""
55,"Tony Connor is a new kind of celebrity. He is very famous online, but people who don't watch online videos of bike stunts might not know him. He is a 'street trials cyclist', which means he jumps from one difficult place, like a roof or a wall, to another. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I met him for an interview at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, many local boys and older people recognized him and called him 'an absolute legend'. After seeing his skills, I agreed with them. Even though I was doubtful at first, I was impressed by his bravery and creativity. Before each stunt, he explained what he planned to do, and I often doubted he could do it. But after he succeeded, he seemed not very interested in my praise. Despite his online fame, Tony says he is a reluctant celebrity. He finds it hard to be social and prefers doing things rather than talking about them. This is interesting because his fame comes from social media and camera technology. He says this technology helps people like him make a living. However, he sometimes feels that everyone is too focused on cameras and screens. But he is not complaining because his videos allow him to earn money from what would have been just a hobby in the past. From my experience interviewing top athletes, I know that two important factors make a child into a top competitor: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. These are more important than talent and help someone keep going despite failure. In risky sports, mental strength is very important. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times on easy but new obstacles. He just got up and tried again until he succeeded. Not everyone sees Tony as a hero. Some people think he takes unnecessary risks. Tony says these people don't understand the sport and don't know he gets expert advice to reduce risks. He is careful about the risks he takes. He says some people never feel scared and shouldn't do these sports, while others feel fear but can overcome it. He is in the second group. He is not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning. Sometimes he needs time to get ready mentally before trying a new stunt. He knows he must not lose confidence before jumping. If he fully commits, he is fine."
56,"Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many dangerous challenges for charity. She has run a marathon in the desert and traveled down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a high wire, which is a long thin piece of metal, 66 meters above the ground. She walked between two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist connected to another wire above. To help her keep her balance and not fall, she carried a long stick that weighed eight kilograms. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Even though she had some circus skills, she found out that high-wire walking was very different. ""The training was a shock,"" said Helen. ""I didn’t realize how strong I’d need to be. Every day started at 8 am with a run up a steep hill; then came an hour of exercises, with another hour after my day practicing on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could continue. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt a lot. But it was important to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!"" On the day of the challenge, it was windy, and Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I’ve done,"" she said afterward. ""I’m glad it’s over!"" However, the experience has not stopped Helen from planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike."
57,"In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, which is an old bicycle with one big wheel and one small wheel. Before this, he had written a book about his travels in Canada in a 50-year-old car. He loved motor sports and worked building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff rode an old bicycle to work and even used it to go on holiday to Amsterdam. ‘That trip opened my eyes,’ he says. ‘I decided to see the world by bike.’ Jeff didn’t want a normal touring bike and wanted to build one himself. ‘The craziest bicycle I could think of was a penny farthing, so I went to the museum to see how they were made.’ After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, he finally set out in 2006. He traveled for three years through 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. ‘Although I met cyclists who could ride up mountains on their bikes, which I couldn’t do, I never regretted my penny farthing. The further away from home I got, the more amazed people seemed by it.’ His worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream. A serious fever left him in a hostel bed without medicine for ten long days. He had no money for hospital bills or the journey home. Yet despite all this, Jeff now says, ‘if I could afford it, I would set off traveling again tomorrow on my penny farthing.’"
58,"I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have started using an exciting tool called a 'night-vision scope'. This tool helps us see the ducks in the dark! We are concerned about black ducks because their numbers have dropped a lot, and we are not sure if there is enough food for them on the east coast. We know a lot about what they do during the day, but nothing about their night activities because we didn't have the right equipment before. This new 'scope' gives us clear pictures, even on nights without moonlight, so we can learn more and make better decisions about how to protect their habitat. The work is very hard. There are four of us, and each of us works six hours a day. We have studied ducks in different places, and I have had to take a boat to some sites and write down notes on every duck I see. The weather has been challenging – some nights are mild, but often it is wet. Also, it is so quiet that I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We have only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep, even for our special snow vehicles. Still, I enjoy the challenge, especially compared to what summer will bring – hours in a laboratory, where we will look at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it is important to do this. And I wouldn't change it for anything!"
59,"Text: 'When I tell people about my job, they can hardly believe it exists. But it's true! I spend my workdays eating chocolate. Tasting chocolate is important to make sure customers get perfect, high-quality chocolate bars from the company I work for. Every week, I get samples, which are small amounts of chocolate, from our factory. I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, like nuts and fruit. I spend time choosing the best ones for the chocolate. Next to my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products I make. I keep my colleagues happy by giving them samples! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients to experiment with. It's great to have a private space to go to during the day. No two days are the same in this job. Sometimes I am at our food lab, and other times I’m traveling to buy our raw materials. Since I have a young family, that can be hard. But I love the variety and lack of routine in this job, although I think the best part is still the chocolate! People often ask if I get bored of chocolate. I’ve worked with it for a long time, and I’ve never felt like I didn’t want to eat it. In fact, I often go home and eat more in the evening!'"
60,"Text: 'Have you ever thought about what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson is from Circus Experience, a place where young people learn circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching things like balls or even fire, and trapeze, which means flying through the air above an amazed audience. In the year-long course, students slowly take more risks in each class, and parents can come to some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains, “For a circus career, performers need to avoid doing the same thing all the time – it’s important to keep performances exciting and full of action. If you want to be successful in the circus, you must keep practising. Another great part is making friends with other performers and learning from them. Being fit is also very important - circus artists, like athletes, train every day to stay strong. Training is very important, but the best performers are those who want success, have imagination, and never stop improving their skills. People often think you might get injured, or that you might only work for a short time each year. But, actually, the real issue is planning for the future because you can only travel while you’re young, and then you need to think about other options.” The course also teaches business planning. Many former students start businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns, however, it’s not a job for making money! “The work usually means not having a regular salary. It’s also competitive - but great fun!”'"
61,"Text: 'You may not know her name or her face, but you’ve probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a professional backing singer. She supports the lead singer by singing in the background. Many people think that backing singers aren’t good enough to be lead singers. That’s not true – they have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry! ‘What I love about my job is that when I walk into the recording studio, I never know what I’ll be asked to sing,’ she says. ‘It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock. Or it might be a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. I’m often surprised by producers’ requests. I was once asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue, I just do the job!’ ‘Excellent musical abilities are essential for my work, plus the ability to learn quickly. There’s often no printed music to look at. I’ll never forget my first experience of recording the background music for a film. It was very complicated because there were eight of us, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra as well. I was terrified: I knew that if I got something wrong, it would mean recording everything again, which nobody likes. Recording sessions are long enough as they are.’ ‘One of my favourite jobs is doing recordings for songwriters. Less experienced writers don’t always understand which musical range suits the female voice best. By listening to me perform their song, they can figure out how to improve it.’"
62,"Julie Deane started her business with only basic knowledge of fashion. She created a successful company with her 'satchels', which are traditional bags used by schoolchildren. These satchels are now sold in famous shops and are popular with many celebrities. Before choosing to make satchels, Julie considered different business ideas, like cake decorating and party planning. She didn't just go with her first idea. When she decided on satchels, not everyone agreed with her choice. Julie says, ""Many said there was no demand for them – but I was convinced."" She worked with her family from the beginning, especially her mother, who had never had a career but had a natural talent for business. The design of the satchels came from children's storybooks. Although Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, they have been important to her success. At first, she sold about one satchel a week. To create interest, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers, hoping they would write about them in their blogs. They did, and interest in her satchels grew, as did the speed of production. Julie now enjoys seeing which celebrity is pictured with a satchel! While other companies spend money on online advertising, she uses the internet community to get ideas for new styles, keeping her products fresh and exciting. There was a difficult time when another company copied Julie's design to sell similar products. Because of this, she now makes sure she trusts her production team as much as her own staff. Visitors often comment on the positive atmosphere in her offices – people love working there. There is now a new factory, and while buildings are important, it's the team that makes it a special place."
63,"When Vicky Harmiston was a child, her parents let her and her brother Jamie choose what to do in their free time. Vicky decided to try many different sports. She was a good swimmer, and her coach thought she could become a champion. But the swimming club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to balance training with schoolwork. When they were teenagers, Jamie, who loved cycling, bought a special racing bike and started competing. Vicky thought it looked exciting and decided to try it too. She says it was the best decision she ever made. Soon, she was cycling every day and doing very well. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school. Vicky had a successful career in track cycling and won several competitions. Then, at 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky said, ‘I loved winning competitions for years, but I started to feel tired of it – and when the excitement stops, there’s no point. Luckily, I found a new career.’ Vicky got a job with a charity called CycleZone. ‘We work with young people who have never enjoyed sport,’ she says. ‘The first thing we do is teach them to ride a bike. We want them to believe in themselves and their abilities. CycleZone does a great job, and it brings young people together as part of a group.’ The charity uses celebrities to promote their work. Vicky says, ‘I know some people doubt if celebrity support is always good for a charity. They say celebrities only do it to promote themselves, which hides the real work of the charity. But if famous singers and actors can help, I think they should.’"
64,"Ana Ronson, a singer-songwriter, grew up in Ireland. Her parents were not musicians, but there was always music at home. Her grandfather played the guitar and taught Ana and her brother. Ana first sang in front of an audience at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to gain confidence. After some time in the club, she sang with 50 other students at a concert and felt happy. A year later, her brother, who was in a band, asked her to write a song for them. She wrote her first song, Falling Stars, in just three days. She enjoyed it so much that she joined a songwriting course taught by a professional songwriter. Even though she was the youngest, she knew more about music than many others. However, Ana felt the teacher didn’t listen to her, so she wrote a song called Something to Say about her feelings. She posted it online, and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics. Joss Alton, who owns a recording company called Isotope Music, traveled from across Ireland to ask her to join Isotope. At first, Ana was unsure because she didn’t know the company and didn’t want to be told what to sing. Joss convinced her this wouldn’t happen, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The tickets sold out quickly, and it was a great evening. Ana prefers writing songs about difficult times because she feels there is more to say. One of her favorite songs is Decision, about why her brother stopped singing for a while and how it made him unhappy. Ana hopes fans like her songs, but her goal is to write about personal experiences that are important to her."
65,"Last year, I went on an amazing trip. I traveled by boat on a guided group tour along the west coast of Canada. It was my brother Harry’s idea. He’s a journalist, like me, and he wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don’t share that interest. However, I had always wanted to visit the area since I saw it on TV as a child. I knew it was where our great-grandparents lived before moving to Europe. So, I kept asking Harry if I could go too, and he finally agreed! A few days before we left, there were storms in the area we were going to. But luckily, the weather forecast for our trip was for calm seas. I was busy at work and didn’t have much time to think about what needed to be done. But Harry promised he’d taken care of everything, so I stopped worrying. After arriving in Canada, we joined the group, packed our limited supplies into small boats, and set off. The guide said that very few people lived along that coast, and on the first morning, the only other living creatures we saw were dolphins and birds. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the early-morning fog made it hard to see far, so I just focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of amazing colored fish, many of which I didn’t recognize. It was great to stop caring about how quickly or slowly the day was passing. We never forgot lunch or dinner, which we all made together over campfires. When we finally fell asleep on the boats each evening, even though the beds were hard, it felt like stress-free living! When it was time to leave, I was sad. How could I return to normal life again? But I knew if I stayed, I’d miss family and friends. I was also looking forward to telling everyone at home about our adventures!"
66,"My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many games would make me love basketball, but it actually did the opposite. I loved telling my friends how good my dad was, especially when he won, but I usually took a book to read instead of watching the games. 

When I started secondary school, I was not yet a teenager but was already two meters tall. Seeing my height, my sports teacher asked if I wanted to train with the basketball team. Even though I enjoyed the training, I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real match. However, the teacher believed in me more than I did. It took me some time to agree, but a few weeks later, I played against another school. My mum and dad came to watch, which made me nervous, but it was OK in the end!

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was fifteen. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. However, I didn’t enjoy living far from my parents at first. At home, I couldn’t spend much time with friends because of all the training, so that part didn’t change much for me. I got used to my new life in the end, and my English improved quickly too!

I became a professional player at eighteen, three years after arriving in the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was fifteen, but I was too light for my height, so I had to fix that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and have never regretted it."
67,"Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. After thinking about different options, I trained to be a weekend tour guide in my home city, Chicago, USA. This job involved taking visitors around the city, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I got to see my city through the eyes of tourists, and it felt new every time! After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. I thought it would be simple, but I found out that to get a licence, I needed to know a lot more than I had learned. All Chicago guides must answer many questions about the city, including local architecture, history, and public transport rules. After several challenging but interesting months, I got my tour guide qualification and registered as an independent tour guide. Tour guiding is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of your group. You also need to be entertaining, tell interesting stories, and react to changes, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to enjoy a well-organized tour, not hear about problems. I need to make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might post a negative review online. Good reviews are important because they attract more customers. That’s why making tours fun and stress-free is essential. My enthusiasm and energy mean my reviews are usually very good, and my tours are often recommended to other visitors coming to Chicago."
68,"My name is Ella and I am 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand for two weeks with my sister Josie. Josie is five years younger than me, but we get along quite well. We went to volunteer at an elephant sanctuary, which is a place where people care for sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was unsure if we would have much in common with the other volunteers because they were all much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. In the end, we didn’t need to worry. One of our main tasks at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so this took most of the day. Josie found it really hard work, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meal made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river with big brushes and soap. I found this very fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants! My favorite part of the day was the evening. By the light of the moon, we walked with the elephants into the forest where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a bedroom, so we didn’t have much space. We chose this because Josie didn’t want to be alone. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn’t include meat, which we both don’t like. After dinner, all the volunteers and staff spent the evenings talking and playing games. Now that we are back in the UK, Josie doesn’t talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I’m not sure she is being completely honest. I think she might be a bit upset with herself for not making the most of her time there because she missed her friends too much. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to go there. Maybe she will go back one day – I definitely will!"
69,"I'm Gina D’Costa and I have a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people for their friends or homes; many different customers want flowers. Hotels and offices often have flowers in their reception areas, and sometimes we help with photo sessions for businesses by providing flowers for their advertising pictures. Once, I even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding. It was a lot of work, but I was really proud of what we did. My day starts at 4 a.m. when I go to the market to buy fresh flowers. Most people are still asleep then, and my friends think I'm crazy, but I love what I do. It's often colder and darker than I'd like, but that's normal at that time in the morning, so I don't mind. The flower market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. The sights and smells make it hard to choose. If I were choosing for myself, I'd probably only get pink ones because it's my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what other people want aren't always the same. It's not always possible to find the flowers customers want because not all flowers are available all year. I don't really like arguing about prices with the flower sellers, but it's part of the job. Flowers aren't cheap, so I have to try to get the best price. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and set up vases with the flowers I bought. Then we make flower arrangements and figure out how much the orders will cost. Customers are often surprised by how expensive they are, and I sometimes have to ask them to think again about what they want. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I like thinking about how to put together the nicest flowers for the money someone wants to spend. That's what you have to do when you're selling things – I wouldn't want any other job!"
70,"My city has a modern cinema that shows all the latest films I want to see, and many films for kids on the weekends. It’s close to where I live, but a year ago, I felt something was missing – the chance to talk about a film in detail with others after watching it. So, with two friends, I started a film club! We decided not to rent a cinema to show the films. Instead, we choose a different place in the city each month. For example, we used an old factory to show a film set in Antarctica. It was very cold, which made the atmosphere perfect for the film, which was amazing! Some places we use are even free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, so we can keep our prices low. We’re happy to make enough to cover our costs – we’re not trying to make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially now that we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we’ve sold because everything is online – no more worries about empty seats! There’s still always plenty to do, but when people of all ages come up at the end to say what a great experience they’ve had, it’s wonderful. The website has been a great help, and we’re now in contact with other film clubs all over the country. We’ve visited to see how people do things in different places – but it’s always nice to return to our own club! We’ve started a blog, too, because we know that most people now go online for information about films, rather than read reviews in local papers. We’ve also tried putting up a few posters in cafés. Nothing is as successful as word of mouth, though – people recommending us to their friends. And the audience loves the special activities we organize with each film – last month it was a movie quiz, which everybody enjoyed."
71,"Text: 'Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, so I decided to do something special. I started a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many young photographers had done this before, but it seemed like a great idea to me, so I started. After a few weeks, I decided to put these photos on a website for young photographers. I wanted to create a photo diary and show my photos to other people. I was surprised to find out that others liked how I saw and photographed things. I also enjoyed taking photos of many different subjects. Then someone suggested that if my photos had a common topic, my project would be better. I agreed and began to focus on taking photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing—they were taking color photos. Sometimes I doubted my project and almost gave up, but I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos for fun. I’ll never forget when the judges told me I had won first prize; I was so happy because my project meant a lot to me. It was the first time I realized my photography might be good enough to work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio and I’ve never regretted my career choice.'"
72,"I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try camping, sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. These were things I had never done before. In the NYC, you can do different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, and they are run by adult volunteers called 'leaders'. When you finish each level, you get a certificate. 

When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organize activities at a local children’s club for two hours a week. I wasn’t sure it was a good idea because I had joined that same club when I was eight and found it hard to make friends. I was quite shy then, and all the other children already had their own friends, so I stopped going after a few weeks. I decided to take the challenge, but only because I wanted my first NYC certificate. 

Soon, I wanted to spend all my free time at the children’s club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. When I finished the challenge, the NYC leader let me continue volunteering at the club because I had made great relationships with the children. Now I’m there for about four hours a week, and I always look forward to going. 

Because of what I’ve learned at the children’s club, I’ve decided that when I finish school in three years, I want to go to college to become a qualified youth worker – someone who works with children. I had never thought about my future job before starting at the club, and the idea of youth work had never entered my mind. This has been my favorite part of the NYC so far, and I’ve improved my communication skills while helping others. I’ve got several other NYC certificates now, and yes, one of them is for camping!"
73,"I was born in Denver, USA, and I started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, about two hours from Denver. The hill looked very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was so young that I hadn't thought about snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I did well. After this, I quickly developed a love for the sport and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people enter many competitions and get bored of snowboarding, but my love for competing and winning has grown stronger as I’ve gotten older. This helps me push myself harder. I like not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect 100 at a local competition. I wasn’t sure I’d try the jumps that got me this score until I started. That achievement made me trust my abilities more. In the summer, I focus on training and my studies because there’s no snow. I train every day, but it’s nice not to follow a strict diet like in the winter. I also spend a lot of time with my friends. It helps me deal with not being able to do what I love and am good at. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I think it’s important to have another option in case I don’t succeed as a professional snowboarder or if I get injured. I’m considering becoming a doctor if I can find time for college. I can’t imagine getting tired of snowboarding, but I know I can’t do it my whole life."
74,"When I was fifteen, I wanted everything my friends had, and I never thought about the future. For example, I didn't know what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it only if I paid for it myself, so I decided to work part-time and save money. I learned a valuable lesson from this. I worked every Saturday in a café, but I didn’t enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business. I saw my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it. I found it easier than I thought. My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. Mum showed me how to make nice things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first jewellery to friends and family. They said they loved them, but I thought they were just being nice. To see if others liked them, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists bought my jewellery to take home as gifts. Soon, people from all over the country called to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but it was just us at the market stall! That’s when I knew it could work, and I decided to create a website. Since then, I’ve made a lot of money through my business, mostly online, but we still have our stall too. It’s been a lot of fun so far."
75,"When Janine Stuart was just 13, she wrote a novel called Being Amelia, which became a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine’s life. In an interview about her book, Janine said, ""Because of my father’s job, my family moved around the country a lot, so I’ve become good at making new friends. I know what it’s like to be the new student in a class, and that helped me write about how the main character, Amelia, fits into a new school. Some of the funniest parts of the book are about Amelia’s home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since I’m my parents’ only child, I had to use my imagination to describe that."" Janine started her novel one summer when she was bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a published author, and her teachers had always encouraged her to write, so it seemed natural for Janine to start writing. The year before, she had entered a short story competition on a young writers’ website and won first prize. That’s why, when Janine finished Being Amelia and sent it to a publishing company, the people there were eager to read it. They loved it, and a year later, Janine’s novel was in bookshops. One review of Being Amelia mentions that, even though the book has pictures of happy teenagers on the cover, the characters in the story face some difficult challenges, and this makes readers believe in them. The reviewer says that although Janine is still very young, and Being Amelia isn’t a very long novel, she has shown that she’s a better writer than some other bestselling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer: ""At first, I hid when people recognized me in the street, but now it’s OK. Although I’d like to give advice to other young writers, they have to find what works for them. For me, I know that all I have to do is spend time with my friends, and I’ll soon have something interesting to write about!"""
76,"I'm Tom, I'm fifteen years old, and three years ago my family and I moved to a castle on a small island! It all started when my father was asked to be the castle’s manager. He works for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and keeps them open to the public. He was happy because he thought he might not get such a great chance again, but it took some time for the rest of us to agree that Dad should take the job. We were worried about what life on the island would be like – we knew the castle might not be as comfortable as our cozy home just across the water, and there was no school. Once we moved, though, we quickly got used to island life. The castle isn’t very beautiful, but our apartment in it is comfortable. The island feels very friendly in summer because it attracts lots of visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. During the winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren’t as many teenagers among them as I had hoped. The adults all support each other and help with repairs on the island, which often involves a lot of hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling by boat every day back to my old school. I was excited about going on stormy days when there are huge waves – but the ferries don’t run then! And I’ve found out that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. So when schoolmates come home to stay with me, I always tell them to hurry up! But we often get the most fantastic views, like when the sun goes down over the sea. Some days, though, it’s so foggy that you can’t see anything, then within hours it’s bright sunshine again – it still seems amazing when that happens, even after living here all this time. Of course, we do get terrible storms, and I sometimes wonder if the castle is strong enough to avoid getting damaged. But then I remind myself it’s been here for centuries – and it’s still standing!"
77,"I live in a house in the beautiful countryside of Scotland. I have always loved nature and wild animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby: birdwatching! I went to some mountains in northern Scotland with my family, where we saw many birds in their natural environment. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to tell different species apart and find the best places to see them. It was amazing, and after returning home, I joined a local young birdwatchers’ club. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I’m almost there. On family holidays abroad, I’ve had the chance to see birds from other countries, too. We always look for places with group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list! I’ve been to Egypt, and last summer we went to South America, where I hoped to see my 200th species. I wasn’t too disappointed when it didn’t happen, as I’ve learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video online about this challenge, and many teenagers enjoyed it and said it looked like a fascinating hobby. When my teachers saw it, they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I didn’t feel nervous until just before they introduced me and I walked onto the stage. I knew I’d remember what to say and had some notes to help me, but the whole school and all my friends were watching me! I only relaxed when it was over, and the teachers said I’d prepared well and they’d really enjoyed it. I might even do another one next year! I’m lucky to live in the countryside. I understand why many teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are actually plenty of birds to see, especially in places with lots of green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone needs to connect with nature, whatever their age, and it doesn’t have to cost much money."
78,"I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would hurry home from school to play with other boys and girls. I loved it, and after some time, I became a good player. However, my family knew I often got interested in new hobbies and then stopped them, so they probably thought the same would happen with football. But it didn’t. I was already dreaming of playing football professionally when I grew up. And the chance came sooner than I expected. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a talented player. He asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play. After that, she invited me to join her club. I couldn’t believe it at first – I didn’t know young girls could join women’s clubs. But the manager was impressed, and I started regular training with a big club when I was just 13 years old. After that, I improved a lot. Despite this, people still weren’t sure I’d ever be a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. But the coach encouraged me to be myself and believe in myself – he even let me play in one of the club’s championship matches, much earlier than I expected! I’ve never run so hard in my life – I didn’t want the other players to blame me for losing. Then, by pure luck, I scored the winning goal. Even with the large crowd, I could clearly hear my coach’s voice cheering me on, and after the match, the team carried me around the pitch. Fantastic! Since then, I’ve scored many more winning goals! And next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament in my area. The aim is to get teenagers interested in football and to give them a chance to talk to other players in my club. It will let them see the professional environment and encourage them to feel they could play for a top team if they are ready to work hard. But my advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me – you’ll have good times, but be ready for bad times too. I’ve had very few of those, though – so I’ve been lucky!"
79,"Text: 'In recent years, a key change in higher education in the UK and around the world has been to encourage new students to get involved with research early in their studies. This change shows that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists making new discoveries. Instead, research is a basic way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in jobs, because they help you think about the world and do your work. As a student, you add to knowledge. You do not just learn and repeat it; you create it. Creating knowledge means asking questions like Why? How? When? What does this mean? What if this were different? These questions are part of what we call research. Research can be seen as a range of activities. On one end, there is complex, groundbreaking research done by highly trained people, leading to big changes. On the other end, research can be everyday questions and careful work that asks thoughtful questions about issues and makes practical suggestions. Most students have always been researchers in some way. You have done research for school projects or at work. You have asked questions that led to research since you first became interested in studying. You have also used research skills when planning a holiday, growing plants, fixing things, training a pet, or shopping online. In college and higher education, having an enquiring mind, finding problems and questions, and thinking critically about information are expected. Some students may find this hard because, in some cultures, knowledge is seen as already established, and you learn by listening to teachers and books. It might seem disrespectful to question known knowledge and authorities. But in the UK, US, much of Europe, and Australia, questioning established knowledge and authorities is important. This might seem challenging. Critical thinking is very important in research. The research of others is useful to students, academics, and in jobs, but we need to do more than just repeat what we read. We need to think about it, test it, and see if it is logical and supported by evidence. We should not just accept facts and information without questioning them.'"
80,"Cities have always been places of intellectual activity. In the 18th century, people in London met in coffee houses to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso discussed modern art in cafés. However, living in a city is not always easy. The same London coffee houses that encouraged discussion also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. While cities are creative places, they can also be overwhelming and unnatural. Scientists are now studying how city life affects our brains, and the findings are concerning. Although we know city life is tiring, new research shows that it can also make our thinking less sharp. One reason is the lack of nature, which is surprisingly good for the brain. Studies show that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief views of nature can improve brain function because they give us a break from city life. This research is important because, for the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of open spaces, we live in crowded areas with many strangers. These unnatural surroundings affect our mental and physical health and change how we think. 

When you walk down a busy street, your brain has to manage many things: distracted people, dangerous crossings, and the complex city layout. These tasks tire us out because they use a lot of brain energy. A city is full of stimuli, so we must constantly focus our attention. This controlled perception requires effort. The brain is like a powerful computer, but paying attention uses a lot of its power. In nature, we don't need as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He suggested that being in nature can restore our attention. Natural settings capture our attention without causing negative emotions, unlike a police siren. This allows our brain to relax and recharge. 

Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects warned about the effects of city life and tried to include nature in cities. Urban parks, like Central Park in New York, offer an escape from city life. A well-designed park can improve brain function quickly. While people look for ways to boost brain performance, like energy drinks or office redesigns, few are as effective as a walk in nature. So, with all the mental challenges of city life, why do cities keep growing? And why do they remain centers of intellectual life even in the digital age? Research from the Santa Fe Institute shows that the same city features that cause attention and memory problems, like crowded streets, also lead to innovation. The ""concentration of social interactions"" is a big reason for urban creativity. Just as crowded 18th-century London led to new ideas, crowded 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a creative tech hub. Less crowded cities might produce less innovation over time. The key is to reduce the mental stress of city life while keeping its benefits. As the song goes, sometimes people say, ""I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city!"""
81,"Text: 'Where should we look for the mind? This might seem like a strange question: we usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. Today, we have advanced brain-scanning techniques to show this. However, I believe that the study of the mind should not stop at the skin or the skull. There is a lot of evidence, from ancient times to now, showing that objects, as well as neurons, are part of human thinking. From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that stone tools, jewelry, engravings, clay tokens, and writing systems have played a role in human evolution and the development of the human mind. So, I suggest that what is outside the head might also be part of the mind. It is easy to see why people think the mind and the brain are the same. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people without the objects they usually have around them. This makes sense for neuroscientists because of the limits of brain-scanning machines. But this often hides the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I do not want to question the neural basis of thinking, but to show that the mind is more than just the brain. It would be better to explore the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the skin into culture and the material world. This is where a new theory I’ve developed – Material Engagement Theory (MET) – comes in. MET explores how objects become part of our thinking, like when we make numbers and symbols out of clay or use a stone to make a tool. It also looks at how these ways have changed since ancient times and what these changes mean for how we think. This approach gives new insight into what minds are by changing what we know about what objects do for the mind. Think of a blind person with a stick. Where does this person’s self begin? The unity of the blind person and the stick helps us see minds and objects as connected. It also shows the flexibility of the human mind: using a stick, the blind person turns touch into sight, and the stick plays an active role. The brain treats the stick as part of the body. The blind person’s stick reminds us that human intelligence can change a lot by using new technology. My approach sees the human mind as always evolving. It is important to remember that, whatever form the ‘stick’ has taken in our history – from early stone tools to the internet – its main function was as a pathway, not a boundary. Through the ‘stick’, humans feel, discover, and understand the environment, and also move forward. That is why a stick used by a monkey to get food is different. For humans, ‘sticks’ are used to satisfy our curiosity. This unique human tendency to engage with material culture explains why we, more than any other species, make things, and how those things, in return, shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are flexible and change as they interact with the material world. I want to include materiality in the study of the mind. MET offers a new way to understand how different forms of material culture, from stone tools to smartphones, have helped define and transform what we are and how we think. Mind-changing technology sounds futuristic, but humans have used it since they first evolved.'"
82,"Photography is one of the few inventions that have greatly changed how we see the world. This is especially true in the United States, where photography quickly became a part of American culture at all levels. It was used for practical and scientific purposes, in industry, and for art. It also opened up new ways for amusement and entertainment with the arrival of the camera. Historians say that photography might be the greatest contribution of the US to the visual arts. No other art form has been as influenced by US work. This is a big claim, but it shows how photography has become central to US intellectual and artistic discussions. To fully understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the mid-19th century. 

Why was photography so attractive? First, because it was a mechanical process, it matched the growing interest in technology in the US, where change was seen as a normal part of life. Just like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world smaller by improving communication and travel, photography brought the wonders of the world into people's homes with amazing speed. Second, the camera was the best tool for showing one's self-image in a country where personal and national identities were always being created and recreated. Third, the camera was important for creating and keeping a family record, even if it was a bit idealized. Finally, the realistic nature of photographs matched the US artists' tendency towards realism and showing everyday life. 

A photograph draws attention to something, showing what the photographer wants us to see. Every picture says, ""This, you should see!"" Because a photograph is made by a machine, it has a unique quality: it is a record of events, people, or things. It shows what was in front of the camera, giving it a sense of objectivity. However, since it is taken by a person, it also has a personal point of view, or subjectivity. We might think we understand a photograph because we recognize the subject, which is why photography has been called a ""universal language."" But the meaning of a photograph is more complex. No image is shown to us without some context that affects how we understand it, like a caption in a newspaper or its placement in a gallery. To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose and role in its cultural setting: Why did the photographer take it? How did people first see it? The same image might be seen in different places and times, and its meaning can change each time.

For a long time, the camera's importance to artists was not widely known, but now it is very clear. In recent decades, starting with US artist Andy Warhol, who used photographs in his paintings, silk screens, and other works, artists have been using photographs in many ways. In short, photography has become an essential part of art, not against painting, but as an important addition to it, shaping our ideas of representation before the camera was invented."
83,"In 1890, William James, an American philosopher and one of the founders of modern psychology, defined psychology as the ""science of mental life."" This definition is still useful today. We all have a mental life, so we have some idea of what this means. However, even though we can study mental life in animals like rats and monkeys, it is still a complex idea. James was mainly interested in human psychology, which he believed included thoughts and feelings, the physical world, and how we know about these things. This knowledge is personal and comes from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It may or may not be influenced by scientific facts. Because of this, we often make judgments about psychological matters based on our own experiences. We act like amateur psychologists when we give opinions on complex topics, like whether brainwashing works, or why people behave in certain ways, such as feeling unhappy or quitting their jobs. Problems occur when people understand things differently. Formal psychology tries to find methods to decide which explanations are most likely correct in a situation. Psychologists help us tell the difference between subjective thoughts, which can be biased, and scientific facts. Psychology, as defined by James, is about the mind or brain. Although psychologists study the brain, they do not fully understand how it works in our experiences and behaviors, like giving birth or watching a football match. It is hard to study the brain directly, so psychologists learn more by studying behavior and making guesses about what happens inside us. A challenge in psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the mind's workings are not directly observable like an engine. We can only see them indirectly through behavior. Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, using clues from careful observation and logical analysis. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and learn how to control or change the processes it studies. Once these goals are achieved, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply findings to real life. Psychological research has been useful in many areas, like teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people communicate their feelings better. Although people have discussed psychological questions for centuries, they have only been studied scientifically in the last 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or looking into one's own mind, to answer questions. They wanted to identify mental structures, but introspection has limitations. As Sir Francis Galton said, it only shows a small part of brain activity. William James compared it to trying to see darkness by quickly turning on a light. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal reflections."
84,"In a warehouse in a business park in Michigan, USA, there is a place called the Museum of Failed Products. This museum shows the other side of modern marketing, where not all products succeed. Here, you can find unusual items like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were taken off the market because almost no one wanted to buy them. The museum is owned by a company called GfK, and its owner, Carol Sherry, believes each product tells a sad story of failure for the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved.

The surprising thing about the museum is that it is a successful business. You might think that companies would keep their own collections of failed products, but many do not. Executives visit the museum regularly, showing how rare it is for companies to keep their own records of failures. The museum started by accident. Robert McMath, a former marketing professional, began collecting new products in the 1960s to create a 'reference library.' He didn't plan to focus on failed products, but since most products do not succeed, his collection naturally became one of failures.

Today's culture of optimism might explain why these products ended up in the museum. Each product likely went through many meetings where no one realized it would fail. Even if someone did, marketers might have continued to invest money to try to make some sales and save face. Little effort is made to understand why these products failed, and people involved often avoid discussing it.

This focus on optimism is also common in the growing 'self-help' industry. One popular method is 'positive visualization,' which suggests that imagining success makes it more likely to happen. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot has found that people tend to be overly optimistic about their chances of success. Her research shows that well-balanced people often have a less accurate view of their ability to influence events compared to those with depression.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen has studied whether 'positive fantasies about the future' are effective. Her research shows that thinking too much about success can actually reduce motivation to achieve goals. For example, people who imagined having a successful week at work often achieved less.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our beliefs about ability affect how we handle failure. People with a 'fixed theory' mindset think ability is natural and unchangeable, so they see failure as proof they are not good enough. In contrast, those with an 'incremental theory' believe ability can grow with effort and see failure as a chance to improve. Dweck compares this to weight training, where muscles grow stronger after being pushed to their limits. Having an incremental mindset can lead to a happier life, whether or not it leads to success."
85,"Everyone knows that sports teams have an advantage when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but professional sports are changing quickly, and what we used to believe is now being questioned. Two main reasons for this are science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what helps players perform their best, and they have many theories about home advantage. On the other hand, people who manage money in sports wonder why home advantage matters if players are paid well. Shouldn't players perform well anywhere if they are paid enough?

What about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some home games in the Far East to reach their fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe their team needs their support. Fans often think that when they cheer, their team scores, but they forget the times when cheering didn't lead to a goal.

However, there is one thing that fans believe which is supported by science. Home fans often try to influence the referee. In an experiment, referees watched a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This matches what happens in real games. Referees try to avoid making decisions that would upset the home crowd.

Studies show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the 1890s, home teams in England's Football League won about 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. Travel used to be difficult, but now players travel in comfort, and stadiums are more similar to each other. Despite these changes, home advantage still varies by sport. Basketball has the most home advantage, followed by football, while baseball has the least. This might be because baseball focuses more on individual actions, while basketball requires teamwork, which is boosted by playing at home.

Another reason for home advantage might be related to players' testosterone levels, which are higher before home games. This could be a natural urge to defend their home ground. In the recent Rugby World Cup, some underdog teams won at home against stronger opponents, showing the power of home advantage. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""
86,"Text: ""‘The more I practise, the luckier I get,’ said the golfer Gary Player about 50 years ago. This saying is famous in sports and is valued by athletes and coaches. The quote's origin is debated, with many claiming it for other golfers of that time. Its meaning is also interesting. Player didn’t mean he was literally lucky; he meant, ‘The more I practise, the better I get.’ This idea is part of the nature-nurture debate in sports: is talent something you are born with, or can it be developed? However, this is not really a balanced debate. The idea that practice is more important than natural talent has been very popular. Psychologist Anders Ericsson is known for the theory that becoming an expert in any field requires 10,000 hours of practice. This theory has inspired books like Malcolm Gladwell’s ""Outliers"" and others that say practice is the key to success. They suggest that 10,000 hours is enough to make anyone an expert. But, as Epstein argues in his book, this is not always true. He points out a problem with studies on excellence: they often only look at successful people. Epstein explores why some people have certain abilities and others don’t, considering factors like environment, support, and determination. His research takes him around the world, from Kenya to Sweden, and even to the Arctic. In Alaska, he learns that in a tough sled dog race, the dogs’ drive and desire might be influenced by their genes. This suggests that determination might also have a genetic component. Epstein talks about the complexity of the topic, distinguishing between nature (genes) and nurture (environment and practice). He agrees that both are important for elite athletes. He does not dismiss the role of training or environment, suggesting that if Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt had grown up in the US, he might have become a basketball player instead of the fastest man in history. Epstein also looks at how genes can be crucial in some cases and examines issues of race and gender. He asks: ‘If only practice matters, why do we separate men and women in sports competitions?’ Sometimes the best questions are the simplest."""
87,"A recent international report shows that many children in rich countries feel lonely and unhappy. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are children today so unhappy? In her book, ""Kith,"" Griffiths explains that children spend too much time indoors, in front of screens like TVs and computers, and have lost touch with nature. She believes this is the main problem. This idea is similar to other discussions about childhood today. A follow-up study interviewed children to understand their unhappiness better. It found that many children would be happier if they could play outside more. Many people over 40 remember their own childhoods fondly, talking about the freedom they had to explore and play outside. They think this was healthier than the way children live now. However, they often forget that they are the ones who have made life more protective for their children, worrying about risks. Griffiths' book has strong arguments. She talks about how parents' fear of danger keeps children indoors, which benefits the toy and gadget industry. She also discusses trends like giving medication to restless children or making them wear goggles for playground games. It's unclear how common these rules are, but Griffiths expresses her frustration clearly. She also talks about childhood freedoms and rules, from fairy tales to school regulations. While her arguments are interesting, Griffiths sometimes goes too far. She ignores important counter-arguments and at one point compares modern treatment of children to racism, which seems extreme. Griffiths is a romantic when it comes to children. She has an idealized view of them, which might not match reality. She believes children should have freedom to explore and take risks. She says children need small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones later. However, she doesn't explain how to ensure these accidents are ""the right size."" Also, not all children may want the adventurous life she describes. What about the quiet and cautious children? Maybe the real mistake is forcing all children into the same lifestyle, whether keeping them inside or pushing them outside."
88,"I am a research bio-psychologist with a PhD, so I have spent a lot of time in school. I am good at solving problems in my work and life, but this is not because of my schooling. Most life problems cannot be solved with complex formulas or memorized answers from school. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from play. My recent research focuses on the value of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Those with more to learn play more. Carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Primates play more than other mammals because their lives depend more on learning than on instincts. Children, who have the most to learn, play more than any other young primates when they can. Play is how adults and mammals have always educated themselves. The most important skills for children to live happy, productive, moral lives cannot be taught in school. These skills are learned and practiced in play. They include creativity, getting along with others, cooperating, and controlling impulses and emotions. Creativity is important for economic success. We no longer need people to follow instructions like robots or do routine calculations. We need people who can ask new questions and solve new problems. If we can develop thinkers who anticipate obstacles, we will have a strong workforce. This requires creative thinking. A creative mind is a playful mind. Geniuses are adults who keep and build on their childlike creativity. Albert Einstein said school almost destroyed his interest in math and physics, but he regained it after leaving school. He called his work 'combinatorial play'. He developed his theory of relativity by imagining himself chasing a sunbeam. We cannot teach creativity, but we can suppress it with schooling that focuses on imposed questions with one right answer. More important than creativity is getting along with others, caring for them, and cooperating. Children are born wanting to play with others, and this play helps them learn social skills, fairness, and morality. Play is voluntary, meaning players can quit. If you cannot quit, it is not play. Players know they must keep others happy to continue the game. This makes play very democratic. School has become more demanding: breaks are shorter, homework has increased, and there is more pressure for high grades. Outside school, adult-directed sports have replaced spontaneous games. 'Play dates' with adults have replaced unsupervised neighborhood play, and adults now feel they must intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. These changes have been gradual but significant. They are due to social factors like parents' fears, experts warning about dangers, less cohesive neighborhoods, and the belief that children learn more from adults than from each other. Our children do not need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and future generations, we must reverse the trend of the past fifty years. We must give childhood back to children. They must be allowed to play and explore so they can grow into strong adults ready for an unpredictable future."
89,"In many countries, more people in their twenties are using social media to find jobs. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to contact potential employers directly, which used to be possible only by standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with more access, there is also a higher chance of making mistakes. For example, a young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. This executive had many important contacts, and the jobseeker hoped they could help him get a job. But the executive was not happy with this request. She refused his contact request and sent a harsh rejection note, which went viral online. People who saw the note were shocked, and the executive might regret her tone, even if not the message. However, this incident might help young people think more carefully about using social media professionally. It shows that social media can be risky for job seekers who do not know how to use it properly, and many are making mistakes. 

There is an irony here because, in many countries, social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been a big part of young people's social lives for years. When my generation was young, social media was a way to escape from parents and teachers. It was a place to impress and experiment, often based on fantasy. You could talk to someone online for hours and then ignore them at school. With the right pictures or songs on your Facebook page, you could become a different person overnight. But when it comes to professional networking, our experience with sites like Facebook might actually be a problem. Using social media for work is very different, but some young people do not see the difference. We first became popular online by being bold and confident, which might be why some of us still think this is a good idea. Just because many people liked your posts on Facebook, it does not mean you can use LinkedIn to show employers you are worth hiring. We need to understand that what we learned about social networking as teenagers does not apply now, and we must meet employers' standards to succeed in the job market.

One common complaint from employers about young job seekers on professional networking sites is that they are too familiar in their communication and seem arrogant. This reinforces older generations' views of us as an ""entitled generation."" In reality, we are far from this; in many countries, we are desperate to find jobs, which is why we turn to social media. This impression of arrogance can hurt young people's chances of getting a job, even if they have the skills and motivation to be valuable employees.

So, what is the right way to contact someone on a professional networking site? First, clearly explain who you are and what you can offer the person you are contacting. Maybe you could do some research for them or help in another way. This approach gives you a better chance of getting a positive response. Avoid sending impersonal, mass emails, and keep your tone humble to avoid offending the recipient. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it needs careful handling if you do not want to be rejected."
90,"Text: 'Anyone who says they can predict the future of newspapers is either lying or foolish. If you look at the numbers, newspapers seem to be in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national newspapers has dropped by a third to half. The Pew Research Centre in the USA says that newspapers are now the main news source for only 26% of US citizens, compared to 45% in 2001. Many people predict that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. In 1835, a New York journalist said that books and theatre were finished and newspapers would become the main form of social life. But theatre survived newspapers, cinema, and television. Radio has done well in the TV age, and cinema has stayed popular despite videos and DVDs. Even vinyl records have become popular again, with online sales up 745% since 2008. Newspapers were once new media too, but it took centuries for them to become the main source of news. This happened in the mid-19th century with the steam press, railway, and telegraph. It was also important that people started to believe that everything is always changing and we need regular updates, a new idea in those times. Now, we expect change. In medieval times, people only noticed the changing seasons and big events like famine or disease, which they couldn't predict. Life was seen as cyclical, with important truths repeating. Journalism as a full-time job only started in the 19th century. Even then, there was no clear reason why people needed news regularly. Regular newspaper publication can be a burden. Online news readers can check news whenever they want. Search engines and algorithms let us personalize news to our interests. When big stories happen, internet news can update minute-by-minute. Mistakes can be corrected quickly, and there are no space limits for stories. This is very different from newspapers. However, online news often focuses on being first and creating excitement, rather than spreading understanding. In medieval times, news was shared in markets or taverns, mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. In some ways, we are returning to that. Newspapers have not always been good at explaining how the world works. They might face extinction. Or, as the internet adds to our feeling of living in a chaotic world, newspapers might find that they can guide us to wisdom and understanding.'"
91,"Text: 'If humans were truly comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would enjoy the darkness, seeing the midnight world as clearly as many nocturnal animals do. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes made for sunlight. This fact is part of our genetics, even if we don't often think of ourselves as daytime beings, just like we don't always think of ourselves as primates or mammals. This explains why we have changed the night by filling it with light. We have controlled the night like we control rivers with dams. This control has benefits but also causes problems, known as light pollution, which scientists are just starting to study. Light pollution mostly comes from poor lighting design, where artificial light shines into the sky instead of focusing downwards. This bad lighting changes the darkness of night, affecting the natural light levels and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects life processes like migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the idea of 'light pollution' would not have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night around 1800, when it was the world's most populated city. Nearly a million people lived there, using candles, torches, and lanterns. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no public gaslights in the streets yet. From a few miles away, you would have smelled London before seeing its faint glow. We have lit up the night as if it were empty, but it is not. Many mammals are nocturnal. Light is a strong biological force and attracts many species. It is so strong that scientists say songbirds and seabirds are 'captured' by searchlights on land or by light from gas flares on marine oil platforms, flying around them until they fall. Birds migrating at night can crash into brightly lit tall buildings; young birds on their first journey are especially at risk. Some birds, like blackbirds and nightingales, sing at strange times because of artificial light. People once thought light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear night sky. Unlike astronomers, most of us don't need a perfect view of the night sky for work, but we do need darkness. Ignoring darkness is pointless. It is as important for our health as light. Changing our internal clock can cause health problems. The regular pattern of waking and sleeping is a biological expression of the Earth's light cycle. These rhythms are so important that changing them is like changing our balance. In the end, humans are as affected by light pollution as frogs near a bright highway. Living in our own bright world, we have lost touch with our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our true place in the universe, which is best understood under a deep night sky with the Milky Way above.'"
92,"The founder of a large international company recently announced that his company will stop tracking employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by an internet company with a similar policy. The founder got the idea from an email from his daughter, which seemed like it was written by his media team. Ignoring the way the announcement was made, we should ask: is this idea practical? The internet company and the multinational corporation are very different. The internet company has 2,000 employees and offers one service, while the multinational has 50,000 employees and many different services like finance, transport, and healthcare. The idea of ""take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn’t harm the business"" might work better in a smaller company where employees know each other's work better. The founder of the multinational said employees can take as much leave as they want if they are sure their work and team are up to date and their absence won’t harm the business or their careers. But can anyone be that sure? Even if you prepare before a holiday, there is always work waiting when you return. This is just how leave works; work piles up while you are away. Someone following these rules might not take leave at all or feel guilty about it. Guilt can lead to stress, and not taking enough leave can reduce productivity over time. There might also be pressure from colleagues and office gossip about who is off and for how long. This pressure already affects when people start and end their workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture in a company with unlimited leave, where workers compete for promotions. If the security of guaranteed leave is removed, people might feel they can’t take the leave they need, fearing they look lazy. They would lose their legal right to rely on. The policy might make workers feel unable to take leave, or they might stick to their legal rights, making the policy pointless. Modern technology lets us get work messages anytime, blurring the line between work and free time. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy when employees asked how this new way of working fit with the old time-off policy. If the company can’t track work hours accurately, why use an old standard for time off? But if there are no set work hours, all hours could be work hours. Employees might not know if their work hours are being watched, making them self-monitor, which can be harmful. Employment laws exist for a reason. Workers have a right to a minimum amount of paid leave because rest is important for their health. The benefits like better morale, creativity, and productivity from unlimited leave can exist without affecting worker well-being. I doubt that ""taking as much holiday as they want"" is the real goal or likely result of this policy."
93,"**Simplified Text:**

Journal-based peer review is the process where experts in the same field check a scientific research paper. It is seen as a way to ensure the quality of research. This process is said to stop flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. Scientists often mention it to reassure the media and the public. However, reviewing a paper can delay its publication by up to a year. Is this delay worth it to ensure trust in published research? The answer is both yes and no. 

Examining these issues shows that scientific publishing is changing. I am not ready to give up on journal-based peer review. I believe all papers should be checked before formal publication, but things are changing. The use of preprints is a big part of this change. Preprints are drafts of papers posted online without peer review. They allow new results to be shared quickly so others can read, critique, and build on them. 

Publishing in journals has become more about gaining fame and advancing careers. This has changed the motivations of authors and reviewers. Scientists compete for spots in top journals, which publish excellent research. But the high rewards for publishing in these journals can lead to cutting corners. Stories that leave out inconvenient data are more likely to be published. Reviewers now often decide if a paper is good enough for a journal, not just if it is good. For top journals, this can depend on how newsworthy a paper is, not just its scientific quality. 

These problems are known, but few people want to change the system. However, preprints might offer a solution. They do not require a big change from the current system. Preprint archives have existed for twenty years, but they are not widely used. This is partly because scientists are conservative and because many think journals will not accept papers posted as preprints. There is also a fear that publishing without peer review will lead to 'junk science,' but this has not happened yet. 

Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but authors know they will be critiqued by a global community. Tanya Elks, a psychology professor, shared her experience: ‘My paper critiqued a published paper, which is hard to do in traditional journals. With anonymous peer review, the original authors might block a critical paper. By posting a preprint, the original authors could respond, and all comments were public. This way, readers can judge the quality of the arguments. Even if journals reject our paper, the preprint and comments are still available, so our work is not wasted.’

Preprint archives allow global scientific discussions that used to be private. They can also share negative results, which journals often ignore. Preprints increase how often papers are read and cited, showing their effectiveness. By using the web’s openness, preprints focus on the work itself, not where it is published."
94,"Text: 'When I ask my literature students what a poem is, they often say things like ‘a painting in words’. These answers usually don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked a group to choose an object and write one paragraph describing it like a scientist would, and another from the object's point of view, calling it ‘Poem.’ Here’s what one student wrote: Poem I may look strange or scary, but I’m a device that helps people breathe. I’m only used in emergencies and even then only for a short time. Most people will never have to use me. The item? An oxygen mask – a surprising choice that helped the class see how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to fun and useful discussion. When I was in school, poetry often made no sense to me. I saw every poem as a confusing puzzle that blocked true understanding and feeling. After school, poetry becomes something most people care about less and less. Sometimes you see a poem, and it stands out because it is not like regular writing. It almost challenges you to read it, which you do, and often feel let down by its simplicity or because it is hard to understand at first. Still, you feel good for trying. What do we hope to find in poems? Aren’t they supposed to hold deep feelings, beautiful images, gentle thoughts, or sharp humor? The answer might seem to be yes. But if we want tears, we watch movies; for information or sharp critique, we read online articles. Novels offer us worlds to escape to, paintings give us visual pleasure, and music – well, nothing beats the mix of lyrics, instruments, and melody. However, one thing a poem can offer is ambiguity. Everyday life – unlike reading sentence by sentence – is full of it. But these ideas still don’t tell us what a poem really is. If you search online for ‘poem’, it redirects to ‘poetry': ‘a form of literary art which uses the beauty and rhythm of language like sound symbolism, etc.’ This is fine for English professors, but it hides the word’s roots. ‘Poem’ comes from the Greek poí?ma, meaning a ‘thing made,’ and a poet is ‘a maker of things.’ So if a poem is a thing made, what kind of thing is it? Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals – untameable, unpredictable – or to machines – carefully made and precise – depending on their view. But these comparisons don’t hold up when looked at closely. The best part of trying to define a poem through comparison is not the comparison itself but the discussion it creates. Whether you see a poem as a machine or a wild animal, this process can change how you think about machines or wild animals. It can help the mind try new ways of thinking and make us see everyday things differently. The poem as a mental object is not hard to imagine, especially if we think about how song lyrics can get stuck in our heads. The mix of words and melody is powerful, going back to childhood rhymes like ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.’ But aren’t words sometimes like sticks and stones? Think about a poem on a page of a newspaper or magazine, looking right at you: A poem can hit home like nothing else, even though, in terms of ink on paper, it does nothing more than the prose around it. What about all that empty space around the poem – space that could have been used for a longer article or ad? A poem is made by writing and rewriting just like an article, story, or novel, yet it never really becomes what they usually are – a thing made to be sold. Publishers write press releases and send out review copies of poetry collections, but few expect a collection to pay for its printing costs. A poem presents itself not as something for the market, but as something for its own sake. Because of its special status – set apart in a magazine or book – a poem still has the power to surprise, even if only for a moment.'"
95,"I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. Back then, £70 was a lot of money, and it might have been better to spend it on something useful for the house. Still, my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've found has made me happy because it connects me to the past. But after the gold ring, it took 40 years to find something else that impressed Marion as much. 

It was a dull February afternoon, and I had a couple of hours free. I had a place in mind to search, but because it was raining, I chose a closer spot that mostly had old farming tools. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I tried to ignore it but couldn't leave without checking. I dug down half a meter and was lying in the mud when I saw a round, golden ball. I had found brass curtain rails before, so I tried not to get too excited. But as I cleared more dirt, the ball turned into a thick, detailed loop. I stopped and stared. Then I remembered to breathe. I had seen something like this before—the Great Torc in the British Museum. It’s the most famous object from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years old. A torc is a beautiful necklace of gold and silver, with a gold ring at each end, just like the one I found. 

I took it to the car. On the drive home, I kept looking at the torc on the seat next to me. I washed it in my kitchen sink, probably the first clean it had had since ancient times. ‘Marion!’ I shouted, ‘I've got something for you.’ Still looking at my find, I heard my wife come in and stop. ‘What is it?’ she asked. I explained it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. At bedtime, I hid it in our wardrobe. We had never been robbed, but I was anxious. Eventually, I got up, unscrewed a floorboard in my office, and hid it there. The law says such finds must be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy the torc as much as possible before giving it up—I even took it in a plastic bag to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office in the same bag. The registrar was talking to someone when I put the torc on his desk. He turned, still talking, then stopped mid-sentence. The torc was authenticated and eventually sold to my local council. It's now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the field's owner and me. But the torc has been more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for the nation. People say to me, ‘Now that you've found something so amazing, are you going to stop detecting?’ But those brooches and coins are still interesting to me. Besides, if a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop—not while there's a chance of catching a bigger fish tomorrow."
96,"Sleeping is one of my favorite things about traveling, but I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When friends tell me about their busy travel plans, full of activities like visiting museums and hiking, I just smile and listen. What would they think if they knew my travel plans include time for afternoon naps during Caribbean rain and lazy mornings in Italian beds? Better sleep is a happy part of traveling. When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast in my early 20s, I was surprised by how much I slept—more than 12 hours most days. There were noisy birds nearby, but it didn't bother me. Away from home, in a new place with different smells and sounds, I could sleep deeply and enjoyably. Without alarm clocks and responsibilities, sleep comes more easily. But I think there's more to it than just relaxing. I believe sleep is part of our travel experience, not just a break from it. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, and smells. We take in new cultures, music, and landscapes. During sleep, we process all this new information. That's why sleep feels more intense when we travel. Sleep also changes with different places. People worry about jet lag, but I think adjusting to local customs is harder than adjusting to time zones. On the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early to avoid the heat, rest around 10 a.m., and become active again in the evening. Even though Trinidad is just one hour ahead of New York, where I live, it takes me days to get used to their sleep pattern. Once I do, I feel like I've truly arrived. I remember an afternoon in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with new friends. After eating, everyone slowly stopped talking and went to rest on hammocks and sofas. I realized why there were so many pillows on the floor. I joined them and experienced the Latin American tradition of the siesta. I shared not just sleep, but a part of Dominican life. Travel sleep is also memorable. Away from my usual routine, I enjoy the new smells, textures, and sounds in my sleep. If 'slow travel' means enjoying every experience fully, then what is slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed and tell my friends that travel sleep is an activity too."
97,"The woman turned away from the mirror. ""What do you think? And be honest."" Mia picked up a medium-sized hat with a soft layer of gauze and a silk bow. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said to her customer politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking like a bulldog. ""But it is so boring,"" she said. ""Every other woman will wear a hat like that at my daughter’s wedding. This little beauty will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black small top hat on her head. ""Yes,"" she said firmly, ""this is the one I want."" Mia knew she couldn't change her mind, so she smiled and agreed that the woman would stand out at the wedding. She thought of her own daughter, Jen. It was Jen's thirtieth birthday today, and they were having a family gathering. It had been a while since everyone was together, and she looked forward to seeing Jen, Dan, and Luke. She was also curious about the friend Jen was bringing. They knew nothing about this friend, as her husband Jeff had pointed out when Jen called last week to ask if she could bring Tattie. ""Tattie,"" Jeff said when Mia told him, ""What kind of name is that?"" ""It's short for Tatiana,"" Mia replied. ""I think it’s nice."" ""It sounds pretentious,"" Jeff retorted. Her husband disliked anything showy or fake. He also didn't believe in being too polite, which he called Mia’s reluctance to speak her mind. He wouldn’t have hesitated to tell the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat. He might have even said that a trash can lid would look better on her. ""The trouble with you, Mia,"" he often said, ""is that you’re too polite for your own good."" An hour later, Mia closed the shop and entered the back door of Medlar House: her commute from work was only forty seconds. Four years ago, when Luke, their youngest child, left home, Mia had the idea to convert the unused barn next to the house into a bright space for her business. Jeff was doubtful. ""Do you really think people want hats?"" he asked. Mia knew from friends who struggled to find the perfect hat for special occasions that there was demand. She was right. From the start, after Jen helped her create a website for the business, Mia’s Hats was a success. Women came from far away to her showroom in the village of Little Pelham, where she offered a relaxed and welcoming environment. She let them try on as many hats as they needed to find the right one. With changing rooms available, she encouraged customers to bring their outfits so nothing was left to chance. She recently expanded her service to include handbags and costume jewelry."
98,"Text: 'It's a long way from London to Atlanta, and in his new American home, Lawrence Okoye thinks about his amazing sports journey. He is confident, but even he is surprised by how far he has come—from an Olympic discus final to possibly joining a major USA team. Lawrence has never played American football before, but he might be picked for one of the top teams. In Atlanta, he is still learning his new position. The idea that a 21-year-old from London could be chosen for a big American sports team is surprising. But Lawrence is used to proving people wrong. He was offered a place at Oxford University to study law but delayed it to train for the discus, after playing rugby. Within 20 months, he was the world's fourth-best discus thrower. Lawrence went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, preparing for the world championships. 'Yes,' Lawrence says when asked if he is really trying for an NFL contract. 'American football was in my mind, but I decided to try it when I got to the USA. At school in London, I thought about it, but it seemed crazy then.' Soon after arriving in America, he read about NFL trials in Atlanta. Even though he had never played, did he think he could be chosen? 'Pretty much,' Lawrence says. 'I applied online.' Was he nervous being tested with experienced players? 'No,' he says. 'I don't get nervous for many things.' He doesn't talk much, but he believes in his abilities. His test results made him the most impressive player. 'I was very pleased to hear that.' It was the only time he showed pride. But he is also careful. Lawrence has no experience. How can he join an NFL team? 'Coaches say I have the right skills. It's about how hard I work,' he replies. Will he be calm while waiting to hear if he's selected? 'I will be. There's no pressure on me. People say I'll be selected, but I'm not worried.' This calmness might come from his Olympic final, where he came last. He seems to have moved on and is happy he made it to the final with a great last throw. 'That was an amazing day,' he says. 'The final didn't go as I wanted, but that's sport. I can return to it.' After the Olympics, some thought the event affected him. Lawrence doesn't comment. An NFL player's minimum salary is over $400,000 a year, so the money is a big incentive. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now to American football. With his talents, should he focus on one sport? 'I understand why someone would say that,' he responds. 'I'm trying to achieve a dream I've had since school. If it doesn't work out, I can go back to discus, the sport I love. Every decision I've made has been planned.'"
99,"We had been flying east all night, and I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out of the window, I saw the empty landscape below. The dark shades of brown and green reassured me that, although it was mid-September, it had not yet started snowing in Siberia. I could see no sign of human life, and the view stretched out in a mix of mountains, streams, and forests to an endless horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor woke up and smiled at me sleepily. ""Good morning, Robert,"" he said with a slow, Russian accent. Sergei was a salesman from Moscow flying to the far reaches of civilization to sell safety clothing to local mining industries. His English was almost as poor as my Russian, but with a dictionary, I had explained to him that I was flying to the far-eastern Siberian city of Magadan with only a one-way ticket because I planned to return home to England by bicycle. ""But, Robert,"" he said, ""there is no road from Magadan; you cannot ride a bicycle."" I explained that I believed there was a road, though not many people used it these days. ""Alone?"" he asked, pointing at me. ""No, I will be riding with a friend called Al."" ""Just one friend?"" ""Yes, just one,"" I nodded. Sergei still looked unconvinced and with just one word ""Holodna"" (cold), he pointed outside. I tried to reassure him with hand gestures that I had a lot of warm clothes, though I left out the fact that, because my trip was self-funded, I was on a tight budget. Most of my clothes and equipment had been bought at low prices. In reality, I was not sure they would be good enough. This was especially true of my large postman’s over-trousers, which I had bought for £10. It had all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The hall that morning was full of students slumped in their seats. Some were taking notes without energy. The lecturer droned on. I was thinking hard about a particular dilemma. Should I ask him or not? ""Well, why not?"" I tore a fresh sheet from my pad and wrote, ""Hi Al, Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob."" In the row in front of me slouched Al, my old school friend. I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He tried to read my messy writing, scratched his head, wrote something, and passed it back. I unfolded it and held my breath while I read. ""OK,"" it said. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, and although I was still far from having full control of my classes, the job was good for me. It was often challenging, rarely boring, often fulfilling, and, of course, there were long holidays in which to chase adventures. Twice since I had started teaching, I had used these holidays to meet Al. He had caught the adventure bug in a big way after our bike ride through Pakistan and had decided to do something far more relaxing than teaching: to cycle around the world. Ever since that first ride we had taken together, Al had been setting himself greater and greater challenges. This round-the-world-by-bike trip was certainly his greatest so far. At times he thought that the ride, or the road, would break him. Although it sounded tough, I envied him in many ways. He was having an extraordinary adventure, finding that he could deal with each new challenge even if it seemed impossible. He was proving wrong the skeptics who had told him he could not do it. He was doing something that scared him nearly every day, and it made him feel alive."
100,"Text: 'In The Red Bull Air Race, twelve pilots take turns to race through a series of pylons that are between 15 and 25 meters high. They make sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience what it feels like to take part. An hour before the flight, I had to sign two forms. The first confirmed that I was in good health, and the second that I would empty all my pockets, because small objects can become dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I would need to stay oriented. ‘The horizon is your best friend,’ I was told, ‘the pilot will explain which direction to look.’ I was also asked to promise that when flying upside down, I would ‘completely relax. Try and enjoy the view.’ Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing where I was told not to touch anything. By the time we were moving down the runway, my legs were up in front of me, feet trying not to touch the important steering pedals, hands trying not to rest on any of the many important switches within reach, my mind was made up. Ignoring all instructions, I would not relax and enjoy the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed acrobatic flying. To survive without passing out, you have to stay calm and focused. You have to tense up at the right time and relax at the right time. Panicking is a bad idea. None of this was comforting as we began accelerating down the runway. Dario, the pilot, and I reached the end of the runway. We were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the world’s fastest acrobatic planes, ready to go. The plane took off and two seconds later we turned sharply to the right. It was a sudden, strong move and I felt the air squeeze out of my lungs. I looked up at the horizon, tensed everything, and took short breaths as I sank into the seat. For a moment, I weighed 6.2 times my normal weight. Then we leveled out. We turned sharply left and dived, leaving my stomach at 2,000 meters and my lungs pressed against the roof of the plane. Seconds later, we were 10 meters off the ground, aiming for the small space between two pylons. They passed at 400 km per hour but my moment of excitement was interrupted by a sharp right turn. We hadn’t even done any acrobatics yet. For two minutes, I was allowed to fly the plane, my hand shaking so much the plane shook too… it’s that responsive. Then Dario said something. I asked, ‘Can you repeat that?’ But instead of replying, he did a barrel roll, a full 360-degree turn. ‘Are you okay?’ ‘Yup.’ ‘Have you had enough?’ ‘No,’ I lied. Then he did a loop, flying the plane up and over, making a full circle in the air. I know many people would find this exciting, like those who enjoy rollercoasters. However, I thought it was a bit much. At the top of the loop, as we were flying upside down, I heard a small voice saying, ‘Relax, relax, look up.’ Then I looked up and saw some fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes. It had been ‘soft’ compared to what the pilots endure when they race. To show this, Dario got out some sandwiches as soon as we landed and happily ate. I didn’t eat for hours and that night I dreamed of doing loops over and over again.'"
101,"Doug Allan films wild animals in cold places. If you’ve ever seen amazing footage of polar bears in a nature documentary, it was probably filmed by him. He says his perfect temperature is -18C. Allan trained as a marine biologist and commercial diver. Diving was his first passion, where he learned about surviving in cold places. His big opportunity came when a TV crew arrived in Antarctica, where Allan was working, to film a wildlife documentary. ‘I ended up taking the crew to different places, and after 48 hours I realised that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for me: travel, adventure, underwater.’ He is now a top cameraman and has worked on many major TV wildlife series. ‘I started at a good time. When I began, hardly anyone had been to the Antarctic. You had coral people, elephant people, chimpanzee people. I just became the cold man. It was like all these amazing scenes were just waiting to be filmed.’ The camera and communications technology was very basic when he started 35 years ago. ‘It is certainly easier to film today. If you shot something then, you had to remember it. Today, with digital technology, you can shoot a lot and look at it immediately. You used to have to think about what shots you needed next, and what you had missed. You shot less. Film was very expensive. Today you can have too much material.’ ‘My value is field experience in cold conditions. I have a feel for it. I have spent so much time on sea ice it now feels like crossing the street. I do get cold toes but the poles are healthy places. There are no leeches, no diseases or mosquitoes.’ Wildlife filming, Allan says, is full of great successes, but also failures and embarrassments. Once, he was in the Orkneys to film kittiwakes. Unfortunately, he could not identify which birds they were. When Allan recently got permission to film sequences for a major TV series in Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, he did not expect an easy task. It is a world of polar bears and is strictly off limits to all but the most fearless or foolish. Usually -32C in April, the wind is strong and carrying cameras in the deep snow is very difficult. After walking five or more hours a day and watching polar bear dens in the snow slopes for 23 days, however, Allan had seen just one mother bear and her cub. By day 24, though, he says, he was living in bear world, at bear speed, with bear senses. ‘We find a new hole and wait. We shuffle, hop, bend, stretch and run to stay warm. Five hours of watching and then with no warning at all I catch a glimpse so brief that I almost miss it. But the camera’s locked on the hole on full zoom and my eye’s very quickly on the viewfinder. Nothing for a couple of seconds and then an unmistakable black nose. Nose becomes muzzle, grows bigger to become full head and in less than a minute she has her front legs out and is resting on the snow in front of the hole. She’s looking at me but she’s not bothered. I’ve just pulled out of a close-up thinking this can’t get much better … when she sets off on a long slide down the slope. I’d swear it’s partly in sheer pleasure,’ he recounts, adding that two cubs then appeared at the den entrance. ‘Clearly it’s their first view of the world … It’s show time on the slopes and we have front-row seats.’ Now Allan would like to make his own film about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experience the impact of it first hand. He says he would be able to make an extraordinary documentary."
102,"In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone without getting more supplies on the way. This meant swimming through very cold waters and facing frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now he is back in the Arctic, planning an even more ambitious expedition. Explorers are confident and driven people, and they need to be. This time, there is much more at risk. Pen and two colleagues will go on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre journey to the North Pole, taking detailed measurements of the ice's thickness and density. No one has done this before, and he knows the results will be very important for scientists. This will give the clearest picture yet of how global warming is affecting the polar ice. Pen was trained for this job. As a child, he was looked after by a woman who had worked for the famous polar explorer, Scott of the Antarctic. She was hired to make him tough by sending him out into blizzards and icy winds with very few clothes. His father gave him a love for frozen adventures, and Pen showed unusual physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a ‘spine of steel’ and shares his love for the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and says she worries more about him when he’s at home: ‘He’s in more danger driving along the A303 because I know that in his head he’s somewhere in the Arctic.’ For fun, she once raced against him in a famous mountain event where riders on horseback compete against people on foot. Mary and her horse finished an hour before Pen. Pen and Mary live in the countryside with their two children. ‘It’s much harder to be away from them this time,’ he admits. ‘They were one and five when I last went, and I made a mistake in how I said goodbye. I told my son, “You’re the man of the house now, look after your mum and your sister.” He took it seriously, asking his mum how she was all the time, but it became too much for him. It was well-intentioned but unfair.’ For similar reasons, he plans to have very little contact with them while in the Arctic. ‘If you call them, you remind them how far away you are.’ He is spending these last days before leaving preparing his equipment carefully. ‘Out on the ice, you can’t fix things or do anything that isn’t simple,’ he says. With him will be Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and the expedition photographer, Martin Hartley. They will have a team of six flying in supplies. Being part of a team is more stressful for someone like him, says Pen, and he has something else on his mind too. ‘I’m going to be 47 on Thursday. I’ve done far less training than I’m comfortable with.’ Why? ‘Organisational things always seem more urgent. So I’m almost fearful of what I’m going to ask of myself.’ Pen believes his mission reconnects exploration with the search for knowledge that inspired past explorers. ‘Reaching the North Pole was a personal goal,’ he admits, ‘and not very useful to anyone beyond the polar adventuring community. This time, scientists will benefit from the data, and we’re creating a way to involve as many people as possible in what’s happening in the Arctic Ocean. This is important work, and only we can do it,’ he says. ‘Our skills, which are usually unusual and not needed in society, have become very relevant. Suddenly, we’re useful again.’"
103,"Text: I had a 'year off'. What was I going to do? Being a successful Olympian is amazing. I had the chance to do more writing, TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. These activities were great, but I missed having something competitive to focus on. I wanted to stay in shape in case I wanted to compete in the Olympics again. So, I entered marathons and triathlons. That should have been enough, but I kept thinking about TV presenter Ben Fogle's invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I love rowing and missed the feeling of the boat moving through the water, but I wasn't ready to train every day. Still, I wanted some kind of competition. I asked my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but no one was interested. I knew if I entered, I would want to win. Would rowing with Ben give me the best chance to win? Probably not. But being an underdog with no pressure was interesting. I contacted Ben. He was going to do the race anyway and had found the money for the entry fee and a boat deposit, making the race a real possibility. We talked about the costs; the boat and equipment would cost £70,000 – a lot of money. We thought we had a good chance, but it would take work to secure it. Besides the race costs, I also had to consider losing money from being away from home. Speaking at business conferences is a good way to earn money as a retired athlete. It's nice that people are interested, but I find it hard to talk about past achievements without a new goal. Doing the race would mean I could talk about something new: rowing across the Atlantic. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, but one big lesson was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. Preparing for the Olympics was tough, but looking back, it was straightforward. Yes, I trained almost every day, but the program was set, and there were doctors and dieticians. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. I didn't want it to look like I just wanted to be on TV. My worries went away during our preparations. The Atlantic Rowing Race is more about the mind than just rowing. Ben had done the tough Marathon des Sables, spent time at sea, and lived on a deserted island. But he couldn't row. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I could have been more patient, but I needed to be honest about the improvements he needed. I should have known his level when I agreed to race with him."
104,"Text: 'Just over a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I was feeling restless. I dreamed of Arctic landscapes, cold and empty spaces, maybe because of the noise and crowds in London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband, Pasi Ikonen, in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to hire me as a husky dog handler for a busy winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow (for anything from an hour to five days). They started with six dogs, which quickly grew to more than 100. Recently, they took over a second place – the 'wilderness farm’, which they said was a beautiful but simple place with unreliable electricity and no running water. They told me I could join the team for three months if I knew what I was getting into. 'The hours are long, the conditions tough, and the work very physical.’ I started packing right away. November 6, London On my flight, I look at a page with more than 100 pictures of huskies; I am supposed to memorize their names before I arrive, but I feel distracted and nervous. I put the page down and look out of the window instead. It is said that spring moves north at about 26 km per day, like a wave of opening flowers and leaves. But I think I am seeing the opposite, with winter moving south, and the rivers freezing. November 7, Helsinki and Hetta The bus north is everything I hoped for. We drive through endless dark forest – thin trees covered in snow – stopping sometimes to let reindeer move out of the way. I arrive at the farm after dark and am barely through the door when I’m given a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. 'Do you want to be thrown in at the deep end?’ Anna asks. It’s a rhetorical question. I follow the sound of barking, which becomes very loud by the time I reach the dog sheds. Three people are running back and forth with the huskies, harnessing them to sleds. The dogs are almost crazy with excitement, pulling hard against the ropes to start running. I can barely hear to introduce myself, but the others are too busy to talk much anyway. I stand on the side and rub the forehead of one of the quieter dogs. Someone gestures at me impatiently – 'Get in!’ – and I almost fall into the nearest sled. A command is given, and with a jerk, we are off into the dark, with only a head torch for light. November 15, Hetta It doesn’t take long to become part of the husky guides, but not before a tough questioning about what I bring to the group. 'Are you useful?’ Anna asks. I’m unsure. Am I? More questions show that no, I am not: I have never driven a snowmobile, haven’t done woodwork since school, and have never chopped anything with an axe. 'You do have a driving licence?’ someone asks finally. I nod, relieved. The basics of dog-sledding can be learned quickly: lean into the corners, put both feet on the brake to stop, and, whatever happens, don’t let go of the handlebar. But everything else seems very complicated. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs become very difficult in freezing conditions. A bowl of water will freeze solid while you watch, so we must make a 'soup’ of meat in hot water for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head is spinning with instructions and my muscles ache from dragging heavy sleds – and from being dragged around by overexcited huskies. But I feel triumphant. 'I can chop with an axe, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw,’ I email friends. 'In the snow.’'"
105,"On that day, as Radcliffe crossed the finish line, the press gathered to understand her amazing run. Her time was so good that it would qualify her to compete in the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about a natural treatment, emu oil, which Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman had recommended. Radcliffe used it to heal after she had an accident with a bike while training. Radcliffe says the achievement never really felt real to her. Looking back, she realizes it was a big deal at the time. However, she felt it was just what she was meant to do that day. Her team had decided not to set any limits, and that was their motto: no limits. During the race, her husband and coach, Gary Lough, was in a car with her support team, listening to the radio. With him was Gerard Hartmann, her physiotherapist. After 16 kilometers, Radcliffe's agent worried if she could keep up the fast pace, fearing she might drop out. Hartmann was angry at this, but he admitted that anyone who didn’t know how fit she was might think it was risky to start so fast. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she crossed the line in less than three minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very fast but still managed to sprint the last part in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought, ‘I can run quicker than that,’ and even planned to do it again next year. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. After the race, people wondered how an athlete with such an awkward style could beat the skilled East African runners. Hartmann had worked with Radcliffe for weeks, helping her manage the 250-300 kilometers she ran each week. He said, ‘I've worked with 63 Olympic medallists, and no one could handle pain like her. She would push me to work so deeply into her muscles that I had to ice my thumbs afterward.’ Hartmann described traveling 13 hours from Ireland to Radcliffe's training base in France, only to be greeted by her husband saying, ‘Gerard, you're 15 minutes late, Paula's waiting.’ There was no time for a friendly greeting. Radcliffe was ready for a two-hour session. Hartmann said, ‘Paula would get every last bit of effort out of you. That's what made her so good.’ During that time, Hartmann spent so much time with Radcliffe that his other athletes became resentful. Can Radcliffe explain why no one has broken her record? ‘Not really. I trained very hard, but there are more talented people out there. I thought Mary Keitany might do it. Maybe it's because people are racing each other more than racing themselves.’ What does she mean? ‘That mental way of never easing up, even when you've won the race, probably pushed me to it because I never thought, “I can relax now,” it was always: “keep pushing as hard as you can.” Radcliffe didn’t know it then, but that marathon was the peak of her career. She would never run as fast again. However, she left a lasting legacy, inspiring many women to take up long-distance running."
106,"Text: 'When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I didn't know how viewers and the press would react. At that time, there was a lot of talk about a food 'revolution' in Britain. I believed our show added something new to this, but I was still worried: would people like a cooking style that included not just techniques but also history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode with both joy and fear. I needn't have worried. The show's success led to many other interesting projects, including a book about my experiences at my restaurant. Each project feels like a journey, whether into the past, the mind, or cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each with its own TV show. In these, the journey was often very physical, with travel and meeting new people. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, where you travel the world to meet amazing artisans, like a man who makes the best-tasting golden pasta. These people have spent years chasing their own ideas of perfection. Perfection is very personal. Even choosing which dishes to include in the series was difficult, and I knew some people would be upset if their favorite dish was left out. 'Where's steak and kidney pie and bread and butter pudding?' I could imagine people asking. But after long discussions, the TV team and I made a list that had something for everyone. This showed me that everyone has their own idea of perfection, based on emotions, memories, and surroundings. Despite the book's title, I knew from the start that I wouldn't claim the recipes were 'definitive'. But I thought that by using my skills and knowledge, and by talking to food producers, artisans, chefs, and their customers, I could find out what made these dishes special. The dictionary says 'perfection' means being perfect, but it also means improving through constant experimentation. Trying ideas and changing them until you have something unique. The TV series let me explore foods, people, and places I hadn't seen before, and I was excited about that. Searching for the best ingredients took me around the world. Some of my adventures included being taken to a canning factory that processed the wrong type of tomato and visiting a dairy farm with low standards, so we had to stop filming there! While refining each recipe, I ended up hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine, and nearly burning my house down trying to get the oven hot enough for a proper Neapolitan-style pizza.'"
107,"We were still hours away from Marrakech when the van made a loud noise and went off the road into a field, stopping suddenly. John got out and opened the hood. He looked at the engine for a long time with his hands in his pockets, looking like he knew what he was doing. ‘Actually, I don’t know what I’m doing,’ he said after a while, and he and Mum started to laugh. Bea was worried, ‘We can’t stay here forever,’ she said. The field was big, with just grass and many flowers like poppies and daisies. ‘No, we can’t stay here forever,’ I repeated, because it was always safest to agree with Bea. We both got back into the van and waited for Mum and John to stop laughing. We sat by the road and watched John get smaller as he went to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay on the grass. ‘Tell us a story,’ she said. Bea lay down next to her. ‘Go on, tell us a story.’ So I told them about how, the day before we left London, I heard two birds talking. I told them what the birds talked about: breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. I told them about the argument they had over a worm. ‘That’s silly, no one understands bird language,’ Bea said. My eyes stung. ‘I do.’ But my voice didn’t sound convincing. ‘Liar.’ I blushed. How could I be lying if I remembered every word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. ‘Mum…?’ But she had fallen asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to the hotel. Bea didn’t want to get out. The boys didn’t mind and waved and smiled at her through the back door windows. We followed John into a café. It was not far from where our van was parked. ‘It’s a hotel,’ John whispered. ‘I think it might be expensive.’ ‘We’ll just have some tea,’ Mum said, and we sat in the shade of the terrace. The tea was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked into the pot. ‘It’s like syrup in there,’ she said. We stayed at the café all day while John looked sadly at the engine. ‘I suppose it’s a miracle it got us this far,’ he said when it started to get dark. Mum put blankets on the ground for us to sleep in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on ground that wasn’t moving. ‘I’ll have to get us towed into Marrakech,’ John said from the other side of Mum. Half an hour later we were in a truck watching our van being pulled by a rope with John driving it. At first, Bea didn’t want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she sat in the front with the driver. I kept wondering how we’d get home now that our van had to be towed everywhere. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep."
108,"Lucy was at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom, talking to two other pianists at the Prague Classical Music Festival. They were not competing like her: one was a guy from Tokyo, and the other was a girl from a European city, whose name was Liesel or Louisa. They were both about ten years older than Lucy and spoke English well enough to discuss the music they were playing and their travel plans. 

‘I think I'm doing Tanglewood this summer,’ Lucy told them. It sounded impressive, but she didn't really want to go. She often did things she didn't want to, like concerts and competitions, which made her miss so much school that she wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she studied with tutors from the University of San Francisco. She hadn't even wanted to come to the Prague Festival, which only accepted fifteen pianists in her age group from around the world. Out of thousands of applicants, she was chosen. Her dad bought her a white-gold necklace with an L pendant to celebrate, and her little brother Gus dreamed of being at the festival one day. Her teacher, Grace Chang, took her out for a special dinner to plan her music pieces. Lucy hadn't applied herself; her mom had sent in the application and CD. ‘I didn't want you to be disappointed if you didn’t get in,’ her mom said. Lucy thought it was more like her mom didn't want her to say no. At that time, Lucy thought disagreeing was the worst thing to do, so she didn't try to back out.

The guy from Tokyo leaned forward. ‘Tanglewood?’ he asked. ‘Yeah,’ Lucy replied. ‘How old are you?’ ‘Fifteen.’ He exchanged a look with Liesel/Louisa, who said, ‘Wow.’ Lucy didn't mean to brag. It was hard to know when sharing her achievements was too much. ‘It's just part of this new youth-spotlight thing they're trying...’ Liesel/Louisa excused herself to talk to someone else. Tokyo stayed. ‘Have you ever been to Japan?’ he asked. He had long, shaggy hair, like many musician guys, to show they were cool. ‘Once. When I was, like, eight,’ Lucy said. He started to reply when Lucy's grandfather appeared. ‘Lucy, let me introduce you to someone,’ he said, pulling her away. ‘And don't get too friendly with the competition.’ ‘They're not the competition,’ Lucy said. ‘Everyone is the competition,’ her grandfather replied.

Her grandfather took her around the room to meet important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, only hearing about half of what was said. In the elevator to their suite after the party, her grandfather said, ‘You did well, Lucy. I’m proud of you. This is an important festival, and there’s a buzz about you. They all know who you are.’ Lucy liked being somebody, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young for the attention. Being a concert pianist didn't make her special to the kids she used to go to school with. Even her best friend, Reyna, didn't know or care that she could play a Rachmaninov allegro. But in places like this, she knew she mattered."
109,"Text: ""‘It’s not good for you to spend so much time online. You need to get out into the real world,’ said Dad. He’s hard to argue with, so I decided to see what experts say – and it’s quite interesting. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a strong sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says ‘social networking is a key part of modern childhood. Teenagers don’t just use media for tasks like buying tickets or checking emails like adults do – they live in it. It’s not good or bad – it’s how you use it that matters.’ How does our social networking compare with what our parents did at our age? Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says it’s like the modern version of hanging out at the youth club, as today’s parents did when they were younger, to share jokes and gossip: a kind of virtual youth club. It helps teenagers develop a sense of identity away from their parents and learn to deal with teenage issues and get along with their peers. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says: ‘Adolescence is a time when you ask, who am I? Social networking can help you develop that self-identity: you can post about your favorite music or sports, discover what you enjoy, and see that other people have different views. Research shows that active social networkers are not as self-centered as those who don’t use social media.’ He says that using social media can help if you’re shy: ‘Communicating online can be more comfortable than face-to-face, and there may be benefits from practicing social skills in a less threatening environment.’ Professor Andrew Phillips is studying how young people use social networking sites. He thinks they can help if you’re quiet and have a special interest because they let you connect with others who like the same things. ‘If you’re one of only three people in your school who likes a certain type of music, you might feel alone. But if you find a social networking group of people who like the same thing, you can still be popular, just in a different way,’ he says. Pauline White, a digital education expert, told me something interesting: ‘It’s people your age who find new interests online, join groups of like-minded people – and then create their own content – who are really using the potential of social networks.’ She thinks social networking is becoming a creative force: teenagers are making videos, podcasting, and blogging about things that interest them. Photo-sharing sites, she says, are changing creativity. Keen photographers can connect with each other, learn skills, share images, and deepen their interest. ‘This all adds to employability and will be useful in the workplace,’ she says. ‘Every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness – and you need to understand how it works and can create customers. For example, if you develop a product and have 1000 friends on different social networks, they’re all potential customers for that product. If you link all those networks together, there’s your customer base.’ Teenagers who use social networking creatively will benefit when they become adults and start working, agrees Matthews. ‘One of the great things about many sites is the chance to work with others to create content and then share it. Collaboration is a real 21st-century skill and an important part of being employable in a digital age.’"""
110,"Text: 'When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, a long trip through nine western states in the US and a Canadian province might not be the first idea. However, my parents had a different plan for our summer vacation this year. My dad decided to organize what many teenagers might consider a nightmare: a big family bonding trip. ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" my parents said before the trip, while my twin brother and I exchanged worried looks, thinking, ""There are probably good reasons why!"" In mid-June, we packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather. I was excited but knew I would miss my privacy for the next two weeks. With barely enough room left for us in the car, we started our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home for smaller places to stay over the next five thousand miles, I wondered what we were getting into. We drove west through the Oklahoma panhandle. Even though we were still close to home, we had some adventures. We stopped for the night near a town in Oklahoma, under very dark, starry skies, but only after almost being blown off the highway in a dust storm. We quickly learned that on the road, cattle have the right-of-way! The next day, we got up early and started driving again. I noticed a pattern forming. The desert turned into mountains. The days started to feel the same, but each adventure was unique. We walked in the Great Sand Dunes and then went to Pagosa Springs, Colorado. The strong smell of sulfur in that friendly tourist town gave us a hint of what we would experience later. As we climbed to our next destination, we learned that roads marked for Jeeps are best for Jeep drivers. Everywhere we stopped, we saw a mix of old and new. Dealing with construction traffic became normal. We laughed when we saw the big ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument. We passed many wind farms on our way to Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over bear habitats near the roads. ""Bear jams,"" managed by park volunteers, were common when traffic stopped to let a bear cross. Our own close encounter with a bear on the road (and a worried park ranger) gave us unforgettable memories. As we continued, life back home seemed far away, and even the old hotel we stayed in, with its problems, didn’t ruin our excitement. It was a 95-year-old building with no internet or cell phone service, but it had the most amazing views. After watching a rainstorm from our hotel in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right. You don’t need to go to a faraway place to find something special. It was both happy and sad to be home again, but at least I hadn’t argued with my brother during our one hundred hours on the road! We had three thousand photos of our crazy journey to look through. I knew I would remember the unplanned and spontaneous moments the most.'"
111,"Rose Frost was sixteen years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's family was separating for two years. Her father, Jeff, had a job overseas, and her mother, Dahlia, would join him. Rose and her older sister, Amy, were staying in England. Amy would finish her last year of school, living under the care of the college Head. It was important for Amy to stay because it was her final year. Amy was happy because she got the best room at the college, with a kitchen and study area. She also had free Internet and phone access. Jeff and Dahlia would still watch over Amy, even if she didn't like it. So, Rose was moving to her grandmother’s house. Rose only had vague holiday memories of her grandmother and never knew her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, Rose’s parents were not excited, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to know her granddaughter again. Rose didn’t fully understand why her parents didn’t get along with her grandma, but there had been a disagreement in the past. Rose was ten years old when she last saw her grandmother, but her memories were happy. Dahlia said living with Daisy would be interesting. Daisy was very social and liked bringing people together. Rose expected dinner invitations, coffee mornings, and shopping trips. This made Rose smile. Her grandmother was not a typical old lady and seemed to attend more social events than the Queen of England. Before moving, Dahlia and Rose talked. Rose was sensible and mature. She knew about healthy eating, exercise, and sleep. But Rose wanted independence. She wanted to play music loud, invite friends over, or go out without asking for permission every time. She didn’t want to be nagged about homework or staying out late. Daisy understood. Rose’s mother gave her a new touch-screen phone with a video camera for emergencies. Rose was very happy. They agreed it would be about trust. Daisy would trust Rose to act maturely, and Rose would trust Daisy not to be too controlling. If there were problems, they would talk about it. Rose was never a wild child. Her school friends were similar, so her school reports and exam results were always good. This helped her. In five weeks, Rose would start at a new school, meet new friends, and start her life again. It was her fourth senior school in five years, so she felt experienced. She knew this was the last time because she would start her final two years at school. For Rose, it was a new beginning, a new piece in the puzzle of her life."
112,"Charlotte Grainger says her primary school teacher was the first to suggest she might write a novel. ""I thought writing a book was a big achievement because it seemed so difficult. I didn't know what other teenagers were doing, like being in the Olympics. When I turned 13, I thought: 'I might as well try this now.'"" The novel Charlotte started then is about to be published. ""I recently told my ex-teacher about it, and she was surprised. She said she thought I would do it when I was 30 or 40. That idea never occurred to me—I didn't see why I should wait to do something I might be good at.""

It's a winter afternoon at Charlotte's publisher's office. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager there. The book is a big achievement: the story is confident and full of action. Nothing about it, except the age of its main character, suggests it was written by a teenager. The public relations person for the book is with us in case Charlotte needs help. But she doesn't need any support. She is independent, with a lively face and intelligence, but also a steadiness that stops her from being overconfident.

Charlotte knows the limits of her youth. I ask her about the complex moral issues she raises. ""I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them. There aren't many life lessons I can give my readers,"" she says, laughing. ""I don't think my understanding of the world is limited by my age, but I don't think I'm very wise either. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.""

She has a theory about teenagers and how they are ""betrayed"" by the fiction aimed at them. She says there are three types of teenagers in novels: ""There's the outsider who becomes accepted, the naïve teenager who knows nothing about the world, and the awkward teenager who isn't socially skilled."" Reading about these types annoyed her. ""What if you're basically fine? There aren't many stories about characters who aren't inadequate in some way. The impression teenagers can get from some writers is that they can't know who they are because they're not experienced enough. And when writers push this idea, it can hurt their self-belief.""

Charlotte has always loved reading famous fantasy writers, some of whom you might think influenced her, but they almost discouraged her from writing. ""Books by my favorite fantasy writers explore deep things about psychology and life. I asked myself: do I have to do this to write a good book, and can I really do it?"" However, she praises a book called How Not to Write a Novel. ""It tells you that if the reader starts to guess what's going to happen, the suspense is probably gone.""

It would be easy to say that Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get her novel published. Her father's connection with someone in publishing got her book read initially. She knows she was lucky because getting someone to read a first novel is hard, no matter the author's age. ""Every aspiring writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Writers succeed or fail based on their talents, so I don't take things for granted,"" Charlotte concludes."
113,"Text: ""‘Remember, speed is your friend, not your enemy,’ said Gareth, our instructor, as we looked down the ski slope. ‘Now, who wants to go first?’ The group looked nervous. Then one guy, David, who had some experience in freestyle ski-jumping, wanted to show he knew what he was doing. He went first, skiing down the slope towards the jump. He hit the ramp fast and flew up, arms flailing. Even we could see something was wrong. We held our breath. He hit the ground, lost both skis, and flipped head-first into the snow. ‘Remember,’ Gareth kindly told us, ‘speed is unpredictable.’ Maybe I wasn’t meant for this freestyle stuff. On past skiing holidays, I liked practising turns in the snow. I wasn’t one of those teenagers doing tricks on ramps and half pipes in skateboard parks. I thought it looked fun, but I didn’t know how to do it. If I’d tried to join the skateboarders, I’d have risked being laughed at. Then my parents decided we’d have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. It had a big indoor facility near the slopes, with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students jumped, tried new tricks, and landed in foam pits – not a realistic start for what was ahead on the slopes. After practising indoors, students went outside to try for real. ‘Progression is inevitable!’ the centre’s slogan said. ‘Before places like this trained people, inexperienced ski jumpers would just throw themselves down the slopes and hope for the best,’ said Gareth. ‘But remember – once you’re on the real jumps, if you hit the knuckle, you’ll be in trouble.’ The ‘knuckle’ is the flat section behind the jump before the slope steepens again. Land in the zone and you keep moving forward, reducing impact. Land on the flat and you stop suddenly, which is painful. That’s why you need speed. At first, it was hard to convince my body to ignore my brain and race towards the jump. My legs would almost go backwards as I neared the launch point, so I came down hard on the knuckle. I didn’t fall, but by midday I felt shorter. ‘You need to control the jump, not let it control you,’ said Gareth. Day two started on the trampolines in the centre. I thought I’d hate being indoors, looking at the snowy peaks outside, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. Some drills copied moves we’d make while ski-jumping, others taught ‘aerial awareness’ – knowing what your body was doing as you spun in the air. Gareth gave us feedback. My ‘aerial awareness’ needed work – every time I tried, I only remembered the moment before take-off, and then found myself lying in the foam cubes. We went back to the mountain to try again. There were more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth seemed as happy as me, and for a few moments, I felt proud of achieving such a difficult goal. But that didn’t last long. On the final run of the day, I didn’t slow down as I approached the jump, became airborne, and landed correctly. Then I saw both skis sliding down the slope ahead, no longer on my feet."""
114,"Imagine you are on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty with fear, and you grip the harness tightly. The ride stops for a moment, and you take a deep breath as the carriage slowly climbs upwards. There is a pause, then a sudden drop, and you feel your stomach lift. You speed forward, turn sharply left, and go upside down. Your senses are overwhelmed, and you scream from deep inside. But you chose this: like millions of others each year, you paid to enter the theme park.

Amusement parks, with their exciting rides, are a big industry. To create the thrills and escape from reality that visitors want, there are large teams of creative engineers and designers working behind the scenes. Being a 'rollercoaster designer' might sound like a child's dream job, but it is a real challenge. Designers must create the right mix of fun and fear while keeping passengers safe. They also need to add new features to keep visitors interested.

Many people think rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most techniques used today were invented by John Miller, a US designer, in the early 20th century. Back then, rollercoasters were more extreme, but now designers are limited to the track designs from specialist manufacturers.

I talked to three rollercoaster experts. Professor Brendan Walker, a 'thrill engineer', said the skill is in putting the pieces together. Dr. John Roberts, from the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that it’s about quickly changing between different forces so people feel excited but safe. The goal is to make the ride thrilling without making people feel uncomfortable.

To create an amazing ride, teams must build a strong story, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and combine it with new features like the tallest ride or the most twists. However, Professor Walker said that in the end, experience and trial-and-error are key. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agreed that designers need to understand what passengers want and test the rides themselves.

I asked if new technology, like virtual reality, will change rollercoaster design. Walker said not to expect big changes soon. Virtual reality can add something extra, but the physical rollercoaster experience will remain the main attraction for many years."
115,"At 25, Miranda Ellington has already done a lot as a choreographer, creating dances for many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances sometimes. I wonder why she fits both activities into her busy schedule. ‘Dancing again reminds me of what it feels like to be in the studio taking orders from demanding choreographers, and how tense and frustrating that can be. Choreographers can forget what it’s like to rehearse all day long,’ she tells me. As a choreographer, she is like a teacher and enjoys working with young students. ‘A new dancer is often open to exploring new ideas. In some ways, working with students is easier than with professionals because they’re willing to take risks. They want success, but they don’t yet know their strengths and weaknesses well. This means they accept even harsh criticism. They might still question me sometimes, but I welcome their honest feedback.’ When Miranda starts with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps, and the music guides her. ‘There may be music I don’t like, but I still make sure to create the best dance routine for it. If dancers don’t respond well to a composer’s music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find solutions. That doesn’t mean starting over with new music. Ideally, I’d like to be more experimental and switch to different pieces – it’d help lift the mood when rehearsals get tough. But now I’m always working on big productions – the music is already written and can’t be changed.’ Miranda doesn’t want to stay with one institution. ‘I think it’s important to keep meeting new people. But I have to remember that all the theatres and schools I work with have different methods and styles. So I have to be ready to change the way I work each time I go somewhere new, instead of doing the same thing. This helps me avoid becoming too set in my ways.’ We talk about a recent documentary on professional ballet dancers and choreographers. ‘There have been glamorous documentaries before that were misleading,’ says Miranda. ‘This one really tries to show viewers what life is like inside a dance company. There was one scene where a young dancer gets endless corrections, and I smiled when I saw it. She knows she’s not getting it right but can’t make her body do what’s needed. It’s hard to watch but not made up for the cameras. The amount of work and dedication in ballet is underestimated by the public.’ I ask what makes a great ballet or dance production for Miranda. ‘It’s when everything the company has invested in – the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers – all come together. Perfection may be too much to ask for, but aiming high is appreciated by audiences and allows you to get away with a few wrong artistic choices. I’ve been in productions where the dance steps are great, but something about the costumes or props distracts. And that’s disappointing.’ Miranda has done so much work I wonder how she sees herself: is she a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist? ‘People want to put a label on you, and I don’t understand that. There’s also a trend to develop expertise in a narrow area. I don’t follow that, though the time may come when I’m happy to be known for one thing. For now, I just want to widen my horizons.’"
116,"Text: 'A friend once asked me why I travel when I can see everything on television. I agreed that you can see amazing things on TV, but why stay at home on your sofa when there’s so much to experience outside? That conversation gave me the idea for my unusual four-day trip and a film to encourage people to turn off their TVs. A friend of mine was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I attached three wheels and some cables to it and connected them to old seatbelts over my shoulders. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, even one night on the beach. Several friends joined me along the way, helping to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. I’ve been on several walking trips in recent years, but this was something completely new. It was the longest distance I have ever walked, and it was on main roads, so I could stop at a roadside café and relax on the sofa with a cappuccino instead of having the wind blow away my sandwiches while sitting on a rock. I got used to telling people, “No, I’m not doing it for charity, I’m not training for a marathon”. When someone at work asks me about my weekend, I’d rather explain how I dragged a sofa 100 miles across southern England than talk about the latest show on TV. You’ll be able to see the film on my website.'"
117,"Text: 'When I read about guided swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands, I was excited. I had never tried organized group trips before. My brother, who I usually traveled with, was busy, so I decided a group holiday might be good for me. The man at the Greek port seemed curious when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained I wouldn't be alone for long; I’d be joining ten others to swim around the tiny islands. Although still puzzled, he showed me on board with a smile. Our group had exchanged emails before we started, but there was little time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained a support boat would be with us all the time, and made sure we knew how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, then it was time for our first proper 1.5 km swim and I was nervous. I had trained in my local pool, and done some river swimming, but never long distances in the open sea. Soon, the waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group - not where I’d hoped to be. I watched faster swimmers moving ahead like dolphins. I wanted to complete this first distance, though, and was happy when I finally managed it on my own. The following days had a routine: jumping in; reaching a comfortable speed; stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, so did my speed and happiness at completing them. There seemed little need for the support boat. I can hardly wait to come again next year.'"
118,"Text: 'Being a flight attendant is not easy. But since I started the job, I have traveled everywhere, from the US to Australia. I work with amazing people, I have a lot of free time, and life is never boring – which makes it a great job for a young person like me! As a child, I went to a boarding school in another country, away from my family, so I always flew alone when school started and ended. Feeling lonely, I would ask the flight attendants if I could help give out meals to passengers, and some of them let me. I remembered this later when I wanted to leave my banking job and look for something new. There were many young people at the interview, and many were accepted. They were often well-qualified like me and were changing careers. Before the interview, I practiced what to say – more than just saying I loved to travel, as everyone else would say that too. Instead, I talked about my strengths and previous work experience – and I got the job! I would recommend this kind of work to anyone, as there are many things that make it worthwhile – but the free flights I get are not the most important. Most airline staff work very hard, and there is a saying – ‘no-one’s finished till everyone’s finished.’ It’s like a big family – even though we don’t see each other all the time, we’re still close. When I’m not working, I don’t have to take work home. And if I do get difficult passengers, which is rare, I always know the flight will soon be over and I’ll probably never see them again!'"
119,"Text: 'At the summer camp where I work, I really enjoy seeing the children succeed at things they never thought they could do. Almost all the children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel very nervous, but after some encouragement, they agree to try, and they all reach the top in the end. This makes them feel great. We do have children who miss home at the beginning of the week. It's not the really young ones who feel like that the most – it's actually the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their mobile phones all the time. First, we tell them they can phone home after lunch. Then when they ask again, usually after dinner, we say it's a bit late to phone now, do it tomorrow. Most children are fine in a couple of days, and at the end of their week's stay, they all come up to us and thank us because they have had a great time. It's not always the children who feel lonely. We do get parents who are on the phone all the time, asking how their child is doing, which is not necessary. Often their son or daughter will be busy, playing games or doing something else, so we have to tell the parents to call back another time. We often get a certain type of child coming, usually dressed in expensive new clothes. Children like this usually argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand the reason why.'"
120,"Text: 'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors also need to be good musicians. It opened in London last year after five years in the USA, where it was voted ‘Best Musical’ four times! Doing the show with an all-British cast was challenging. In the UK, there are more limits on how many performances young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. Because of this, twice as many actors were needed in the UK. Luckily, the director found many talented UK-based actors, and they’ve just won their first ‘Best Musical’ award. Although the theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, it’s been full every night. Everyone wants to hear the songs that first became popular in America. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the show’s actors. ‘It’s great that I get paid to play,’ he said, ‘especially a beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar.’ He told me how busy the young actors are. ‘We have normal school lessons each day at the theatre. The teacher is great, but I miss my old school friends.’ And what do they think of the show? ‘Well, my whole class came! The theatre has special deals on tickets for schools. They loved it and that made me feel really confident. My parents come when they can, but it’s expensive for them,’ he explained. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie found a spare one and invited me to play with him and the other young actors. We played Days, a song I didn’t know. Jamie helped me, and I was happy when I finally got it right. I was impressed by Jamie’s ability and wished I had similar skills. I was just trying to keep up and was glad the show’s director wasn’t there to hear my mistakes! While the young actors were already musicians, with some playing several instruments, none had played in a band before. Fortunately, they found it quite easy. Jamie admitted that the hard part was looking natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show is on in London for another year and is well worth seeing.'"
