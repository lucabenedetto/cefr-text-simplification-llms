Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of sharing your location on the internet. The website said that when you share where you are, you are also telling everyone else where you are. This might not be a good idea because not everyone you meet online is a good person.
Many people share things on the internet, like photos and stories. But sometimes they realize that the internet is a big and complicated place, and it's easy to get lost. This can be sad, but it's not the end.
There were some people who were the first to use the internet, and they learned a lot about what to be careful of. They shared their experiences on the internet, and now we can learn from them.
One of the first people to share their life on the internet was a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall. He started sharing his life on the internet in 1994. He shared photos, stories, and even art. People liked his site, but sometimes he got into trouble. He fell in love and wrote about it on his site, but his girlfriend didn't like it. She told him to stop sharing his life on the internet or she would leave him.
Another person who shared her life on the internet was Heather Armstrong. She wrote about her job and her life, but someone sent her blog to her boss and she lost her job. This is what happens when we share too much online. We might think we can say anything online, but we can't.
Heather Armstrong learned a lesson from her experience. She stopped sharing her life on the internet for a while, but then she started again and focused on her family. Now she is a famous blogger and writes about her family.

'A long time ago, some scientists started to talk about a low-budget movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? It's a mix of documentary and drama that shows how much we don't know about the universe. This is true, even for the smartest scientists. Some scientists were worried about the movie and said it was wrong. They thought it was a bad film. But I didn't understand what all the fuss was about at first. The movie talked about new discoveries that showed the universe is strange and surprising. Then I saw some amazing things, like how water can change shape just by thinking about it. I had heard about this before, but I didn't believe it. The movie showed pictures of ice crystals that looked different when someone was happy or sad. Many people like this kind of evidence, but scientists want more proof. They want to know if it's really true. The movie also talked about other discoveries that are very surprising. Scientists are still learning new things, and we don't know everything. We might never know everything. Some scientists are trying to find a single answer to explain everything. But for now, the universe is still very amazing and surprising.'

Here is the rewritten text at the A1 level:
Writing books is hard for me, but writing short stories is fun. Writing books is like planting a big forest, and writing short stories is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me, and I like doing both. When I finish writing a book, I often want to write some short stories. When I finish writing a few short stories, I want to start a new book. I never write short stories while I'm writing a book, and I never write a book while I'm writing short stories. It takes some time to switch between the two. I started writing short stories in 1984. It was a bit tricky at first, but I liked it. It was like discovering new things about my writing. Readers liked my short stories too. One of my first short stories was called ""Breaking Waves"". It was in a book of short stories called ""Tales from Abroad"". I like writing short stories because they don't take long to finish. It usually takes me a week to write a good short story. It's not like writing a book, which takes a long time. With short stories, I can write something and then stop. I like writing short stories because I can make a story from a small idea or a word. It's like improvising music. If the story doesn't work out, I don't worry. I just try again. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver don't always write great short stories. I like that. I can learn from my mistakes and use them to write better stories. Writing short stories helps me when I write books too. It's like a practice session. Without short stories, I would find writing books even harder. My short stories are like small footprints I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like messages from my heart, and I'm happy to share them with my readers."

'Science is a way of understanding the world around us. It helps us learn about the universe, from the smallest things to the biggest. Science can be beautiful and amazing, but it can also be complicated and confusing. Sometimes scientists disagree with each other, and old ideas are replaced by new ones. This has happened many times in history. Scientists are always trying to learn more, and they often make new discoveries that change our understanding of the world.
Science is important because it helps us make new things and solve problems. It has helped us cure diseases and make our lives easier. But it can also be used to harm the environment and our health. That's why it's important for everyone to understand science and its impact on our lives.
In the past, scientists thought they knew everything, but then new discoveries were made and they realized they didn't know as much as they thought. This is still happening today. Scientists are always learning and making new discoveries, and they need our help to make sure they use their knowledge wisely.
We need to be careful about how we use science because it can affect our future and the future of our planet. We can't just leave it to the scientists; we need to be involved and make sure we're making the right decisions.'

'E-books were very popular a few years ago. But now, some big publishers are saying that people are not buying as many e-books as they used to. This has made some people worried about the future of e-books. Some people think that e-books will replace printed books. But this is not true. Many people still like to read printed books. In the past, people were worried about new technologies like the radio, television, and the internet. They thought these would replace printed books. But they didn't. Instead, people found new ways to use these technologies.
We get attached to things like books, TVs, and computers. We feel a strong connection to them. When new technology comes out, it's like saying goodbye to something we love. That's why we often look back at old things and miss them. This is true for e-books too. Some people started to appreciate printed books again because they liked the way they feel and smell.
We like to tell stories about big changes like this. We use stories to understand and make sense of what's happening. We tell stories about things that are ending, like the end of a book. This story helps us think about how we feel about change and technology.'

Every day, I wake up at 5:30. I brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how famous people did their work. I want to know how they organized their daily routine to be creative and productive. I think that by looking at the small details of their daily lives, we can learn more about their personalities and careers.
I believe that our daily routine says a lot about who we are. For example, what we eat and when we eat can tell us a lot about ourselves. I'm writing about how creative people spend their time, not just what they create. It's about how they make time for their work, not just the work itself.
I have some questions about how to be creative and earn a living. How can I do my best work and still have time for other things? Can I do a little bit of work each day, or should I focus on one big project? What can I give up to make time for everything I want to do?
I don't have all the answers, but I want to show how other successful people have handled these challenges. I want to show how they turned their ideas into small, daily tasks. I think that's the key to being creative and productive.
The book is called Daily Rituals, but I'm really writing about people's routines. A routine can be ordinary, but it can also be a way to be more productive and creative. A good routine helps us use our time and energy well.
I started this book because I was stuck writing a story and I was procrastinating. I started looking at how other writers work, and I found it interesting. I thought, ""Someone should collect these stories and share them!"" And that's how this book was born.
I've gathered many stories from books, articles, and interviews. I've tried to keep the stories short and interesting. I hope you enjoy reading about how creative people spend their time."

Howard became a scientist who studies fossils because of a change in his family's plans when he was six years old. His father had to cancel their summer holiday to Spain because of high interest rates. Instead, they went to the beach in England. On the beach, Howard found a special rock called an ammonite. He knew he wanted to be a scientist who studies fossils when he grew up.
As he got older, Howard became more interested in the very old fossils. He didn't like the big and famous fossils, but the small and special ones. He studied hard and got a degree. Then he looked for a job at a university. He was worried that he might not get the job he wanted.
Howard had an interview at a university in London. The person who was supposed to lead the interview was late because he had a fight with his wife. Howard had to interview with someone else, who didn't want him to get the job. But surprisingly, Howard got the job anyway.
Howard was happy to have the job, even though he didn't understand why he got it. He was grateful to have a job that he loved. Later, a colleague told him what really happened during the interview. Howard was a little disappointed, but he was happy to have the job.
Howard's life was calm and organized, but sometimes things didn't go as planned. One day, someone stole his bag with important papers for a lecture. Howard was very upset. He had to cancel the lecture and report the theft to the police. He went to get a coffee and met a colleague who was talking to a visitor from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that he could study. He decided to go to Nairobi to see the fossils, even though it was a big change in his plans.

Charles Spence is a professor who studies how we taste food. He eats many different foods, including ones that might seem strange, like ice cream made from bee larvae. He thinks that how we eat and what we eat with can affect how we taste food. For example, if we eat with someone else, we might eat more than if we eat alone.
Professor Spence and his team have done many experiments to learn more about how we taste food. They have found that the way we eat can affect the way we taste food. For example, if we eat with a fork and knife, we might taste the food differently than if we eat with our hands.
Professor Spence has written a book about his research. He has also worked with famous chefs and food companies to help them make better-tasting food. He thinks that music and sound can also affect how we taste food. For example, he has found that listening to happy music can make food taste sweeter.
Professor Spence's home is not fancy, but he likes to have fun with his family. They like to have dinner parties and try new foods. They might play games or use special lights to make the food taste better.

Our brains are very busy. We have a lot of information coming in from different sources. We need to sort out what is important and what we can ignore. We are also doing many things at the same time. In the past, people used to ask travel agents to book their flights and salespeople to help them find what they needed. Now we do these things ourselves. We are doing the work of many people, but we are also trying to take care of our daily lives, our families, our work, and our hobbies.
We use our smartphones to help us do all these things. But sometimes we think we are doing many things at once, but really we are just switching between them quickly. This can be bad for our brains. It makes us feel stressed and confused. We can't focus on one thing for long.
Scientists have found that when we do many things at once, we are not as efficient as we think. We make more mistakes and it takes us longer to finish tasks. We also feel tired and stressed. This is because our brains are not used to doing many things at once.
Some people think that multitasking is a good way to get things done quickly, but it's not. It's better to focus on one thing at a time. This way, we can do things better and feel less stressed.

There is a chimpanzee in a Swedish zoo named Santino. He breaks up concrete at night and throws it at visitors during the day. Is he being mean? In the US, some female bats help other bats when they need help. Are they being kind? People used to think animals just did things, and that was it. But now, scientists are studying animals to see if they feel things like humans do. They are looking at chimps, bats, rats, dolphins, and even chickens.
Some scientists think animals can feel things, like happiness and sadness. This makes people ask questions. Can animals think and make choices like humans do? This is a big question. Some people think we should stop eating meat because animals can think and feel. Others think we should just be kind to animals and not hurt them.
There was an experiment with cows that showed they like to solve problems. This makes us think about where we get our food from. Some people think we should stop eating meat because animals can feel things. Others think we should just be kind to animals and not hurt them.
The scientists have different opinions about this. Some think we should stop eating meat, while others think we should just be kind to animals. The problem is that it's hard to know for sure what animals are thinking and feeling."

'Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear better. Some people think that arguing is a way to find the truth. Technology helps us store and process information, but it's changing how we think. We're exposed to more bad thinking, opinions, and ideas. This can be overwhelming. 
Many people think that reading is important for thinking. But now, people are reading less and less. This might be because they're spending more time watching TV and playing games. 
Some experts think that technology can be good or bad for our thinking. It depends on how we use it. For example, some games can help us think better, while others might make us think less. 
We need to understand how technology affects our thinking and learning. This is important because reading and math scores are going down. We need to look at technology in a different way and see how it helps or hurts our thinking.'

Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office, but he didn't like it. He likes working with his hands and fixing things. His books are about how we should live and how to be happy. He wrote one book about the good things about working with your hands.
Matthew noticed that people are always looking at their phones and computers. He thinks this is making it hard for us to think and remember things. We are also becoming less friendly with each other. We used to talk to strangers, but now we don't.
Matthew thinks that our phones and computers are making us do things we don't want to do. We are always looking at screens and not talking to people. This is bad for our society.
Matthew wants to find a way to make things better. He thinks we should have rules to keep our public spaces quiet and peaceful. He also thinks we should do things that make us happy, like fixing things or playing sports. These things make us feel good and help us be happy.
When we do things like this, we are more focused and can pay attention to the people around us. This is important for our happiness and our relationships.

'What do you do for a living?' This is a common question we ask each other. When someone says they are a philosopher, it can be difficult to answer. Some people think that philosophers are special and know more than others. But this is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else. They think about life and try to understand it.
A long time ago, a Greek philosopher named Aristotle said that thinking deeply about life is the most important thing. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that we should think about our lives and make sure they are good. This is important because it helps us make our own decisions.
Some people think that philosophers are too busy reading books and thinking about big ideas to be involved in everyday life. But this is not true. Philosophers can help us think about our daily lives and make good choices. They can help us understand why we do things and what is important to us.
I am a philosopher and my work is about ethics. Ethics is about what is right and wrong. Some people think that ethics is just about following rules, but it is more than that. It is about thinking about what is important and what is not. As a philosopher, I try to help people think about their lives and make good choices.

'Food is a big part of our lives. Some people love to think about what and how we eat. But, surprisingly, philosophers haven't talked much about food until recently. When they did talk about food, it was usually just a way to explain something else. Now, people are starting to think about food in a new way. Food is special because it's connected to our culture and community. We share food with others and it brings us together. Food critics, who write about food, are important because they help us understand what's good and what's not. But, they're not special because they can taste food better than others. They're just good at describing what they taste. 
Food is also beautiful, like art or music. Some people think that food should be considered art, but it's hard to do that because we eat it and it's gone. There are many questions about food, like what we should eat and how we should cook it. These questions can help us think about what's important to us. 
Cooking at home is different from cooking in a restaurant. When we cook at home, we cook for our friends and family, and we share food together. In a restaurant, the chef cooks for the people who own the restaurant, and they have to follow rules. Food can also help us understand other cultures. We can learn about new foods and people by sharing meals together. This is important in international relations and diplomacy.'

Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US. He wanted to make board games more exciting. He thought, ""Why can't games have a story? Why can't our choices affect the next game?"" He took a classic game called Risk and changed it. Now, players make decisions that affect the game forever. They might tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players keep track of their progress.
Rob worked on a new game called Pandemic Legacy. It's a cooperative game where players work together to stop diseases. His next project was SeaFall, a game about sailing in the 16th to 19th centuries.
To make sure the story makes sense, game designers test the game with players. They want to see how players make choices and how the game changes over time. One player, Jaime, said it takes a lot of time to test the game. ""Sometimes it works great, but sometimes it gets broken and we have to fix it.""
Rob didn't think many people would like his idea. He thought it would be a niche game. But many people loved it! One player, Russell, said it's a big change in game design. ""It's exciting to learn new things and discover new ways to play.""
Another player, Ben, said the idea of an unfolding adventure is more important than worrying about the game lasting forever. ""Most people don't watch the same movie twice, do they? We're buying into an experience.""
Rob wants to see what others do with his idea. He thinks people will soon ask for something new. But Colby, the studio manager, thinks the legacy format is a game-changer. ""It changes the way we think about board games.""

'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at a big aquarium in New Zealand. He climbed out of the water and went through a small pipe to the ocean. People loved the story and shared it online. It's fun to imagine animals doing human-like things. Octopuses are very smart, but they look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Some people think it's not good to imagine animals are like us, but Dr. Frans de Waal says it's the opposite. He thinks we don't want to believe animals are smart like us. He studied animals and found that they can do many things we thought were special to humans, like thinking about the past and future, being kind, and understanding what others are thinking. Animals are smarter than we thought. A long time ago, people thought animals were smart and could even go to trial. Even Charles Darwin, who wrote about evolution, thought animals and humans were not that different. But then some scientists thought animals were just machines that responded to things. This changed how people thought about animals. Now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand that animals are smart in their own way. We can learn about their intelligence by testing them in special ways. For example, squirrels are good at remembering where they hide food. An octopus might test us on how many colors we can change our skin to. Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really escaped to the ocean, but he likes how the story made people think about animal intelligence. He did an experiment with monkeys and found out they can feel jealous. People loved the video of the experiment.'

A company in Australia has made a robot that can lay bricks quickly. A company in the US has made a robot that helps in supermarkets. These robots can do jobs that humans used to do.

'Why do people climb mountains? One famous climber, George Mallory, said ""Because it's there."" This answer is simple, but it's not the only reason people climb. Some people love the feeling of freedom they get when they climb. But climbing can also be very hard and scary. 
A long time ago, a writer named Tejada-Flores wrote about climbing and said that there are different ways to climb, and each way has its own rules. Some people like to climb big mountains, while others like to climb smaller rocks. 
Some climbers say that they love climbing because it makes them feel free. But others say that climbing can be very confining, like being stuck in a small tent during a storm. 
A climber named Joe Fitschen asked a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He said that climbing is in our nature, and we like to take risks and challenge ourselves. 
Another climber, Brian Treanor, said that climbing helps us develop good qualities like courage, humility, and respect for the environment. 
Some climbers like to climb alone, without help from others. They have to be very committed to their goal to succeed. 
Climbing can also be a way to connect with nature and be in the moment. It's like a kind of meditation. Some people even think that climbing is similar to the techniques used in Zen philosophy to find inner peace. 
So, why do people climb? There are many reasons, and each person may have their own answer.'

One day, some musicians come to the island and play music. Everyone dances and has a great time. In the evening, MacEwen tells me how he met his wife. She came to the island to work on a farm and didn't know much about farming. She was good at typing, though! I go to bed and wake up to more rain.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at A1 level:
'Long ago, the video game industry was not easy to get into. Many people thought it was just for young people who liked playing games. But now, the industry is growing and taking seriously. It's still hard to get into, but it's becoming more possible.
Jim, a person who writes about games, says it's hard to get a job at a big company or work on a famous game. But he says the industry needs more game designers, not just people who make big decisions, but also people who design small parts of the game.
Jim says the best way to get into the industry is to make games. You need to make something to get a job or to work on your own. Game design is like a hobby that you have to do to make it real.
John, another expert, says there are other ways to get into the industry. He says it's not just about making games, but also about being creative, having the right skills, and being able to work well with others.
John says it's hard to do it on your own, but a good course can help. Many game designers start by working as programmers or artists and then move up to design games. They like different types of entertainment and art and culture. They might have worked for a few years before realizing that games are what they want to do.
John also says that connections are important. You need to know people in the industry to get ahead. The idea that games are just for kids is changing. More and more people are playing games and using them to learn new things. There are many possibilities and opportunities in the industry.'

Violet was at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting in a long queue to get on a ship called the Queen Caroline. She was worried because her friend Annie had told her to get there late, but Violet got there early. Suddenly, an announcement came over the loudspeaker saying that the computer system had broken down. The passengers were not happy. Some people tried to be patient, but most were getting angry. They had paid a lot of money for this trip and they wanted to enjoy it.
Violet was feeling annoyed. She couldn't find her phone and she was worried about it. She also thought that the whole idea of taking a cruise was a bad idea. She couldn't even call her son Harry to check if she had left her phone in a taxi because all her numbers were on the phone.
A nice couple behind her in the queue offered to let her use their phone to call her son. Violet asked them to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was left in her flat. Violet was relieved that she wouldn't be in trouble, but she didn't tell Harry. She was worried about getting to her room on the ship.
When she finally got to the ship, Violet was disappointed. The room was not as nice as she expected. She was relieved when she found out that she had a balcony, though. She had been worried that she wouldn't have one.

Jonny Kinkead is a man who loves guitars. When he was a boy, he used to play with guitars in his dad's garage. Now, he makes his own guitars by hand. Jonny loves guitars because they can make beautiful sounds. He thinks it's amazing that you can make different sounds by using different types of wood.
Jonny started playing the guitar when he was 11. Then, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. He didn't buy one, he made it himself. He learned how to make guitars by studying and experimenting. His brothers and he used to build model boats and planes, so he was used to working with his hands.
After school, Jonny studied architecture, but he didn't like it. He wanted to make things that people use, not just buildings. He started making guitars again and realized that it's like sculpting, but you make music with it. He thought it was a better idea than just making art.
Jonny has been making guitars for 40 years. At first, he sold them for the cost of the materials. But as he got better, he could sell them for more money. He still makes only about 10 guitars a year, so he doesn't earn a lot. He had to work hard to get known, going to music festivals and talking to musicians.
Jonny thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers today. People now know that UK-made guitars are good too. He says that you can learn some things in school, but you also need to try things and make mistakes. That's how he learned.

'Talking about the weather is a common way to start a conversation in English. This is because it's a traditional way to talk to each other. Many people say that when two English people meet, they talk about the weather first. This is still true today.
Some people try to explain why English people like talking about the weather so much. But they often get it wrong. They think that English people are really interested in the weather. But that's not true. We don't talk about the weather because we love it. We talk about it because it's a way to be polite and friendly.
For example, when we meet someone new, we might say, ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""It's cold today, isn't it?"" These are not really questions about the weather. They are just a way to start a conversation. It's like saying ""hello"" or ""how are you?""
There are three times when we usually talk about the weather. We might use it as a greeting, to break the ice and start talking about something else. We might use it when we're not sure what to say next and need a little time to think. And we might use it when we're with someone and there's an awkward silence.
That's why people might think that English people love talking about the weather all the time. But really, it's just a way to be friendly and polite. We don't talk about the weather because we're obsessed with it. We talk about it because it's a way to connect with each other.'

'Two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, are famous for being good at triathlons. A newspaper and a TV company asked them to take part in a special race. Jonny would drive a car, and Alistair would ride a bike. They started at a lake in the mountains and had to get to the highest road. Jonny was excited because he liked the view and it was cold, so he could stay warm in the car. Alistair was confident because he had seen Jonny drive before and thought he might not make it. They started the race, and Alistair rode his bike up a big hill. Jonny drove his car on the road. They would meet again at the finish line. Who would get there first?
Jonny had a problem when a big tractor came out of a field. Alistair had to carry his bike up the hill because it was too steep. He walked with the bike and then rode it again. Finally, he reached the top of the hill. Jonny had to drive slowly because the roads were narrow and had a stream on it. Alistair was almost at the finish line. He rode his bike fast and stopped just in time. Jonny drove to the finish line and said, ""Well done, Alistair. I'm disappointed.""'

'When I play tennis at Wimbledon, I notice the silence. The ball bounces quietly on the grass. I hear my own shots and the echo. The quiet helps me focus. I try to forget everything except the game. But sometimes, the crowd cheers and claps. I hear it, but it's far away. I'm so focused, I don't think about the people watching me from all over the world.
I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle, told me it's the biggest tournament. I was 14 when I first played here. I lost to Roger Federer two years ago. Last year, I was very sad. I cried a lot because I knew I could have won. My coach told me not to cry, that I would have another chance. And now, here I am again.
I'm more confident this time. I learned from my mistakes. I know I can win. We didn't talk about the match at dinner last night. I was already thinking about the game in my head. From now on, I need to focus.'

She spent most of her life in Africa and became known for her work with chimpanzees. In 1963, a big organization in Britain made a TV show about her and her research. She wrote books for children and adults, and people loved reading about her adventures. Jane Goodall is very famous, but some people don't know how much she really achieved. She did many important things, like finding out that chimpanzees eat meat and use tools. She also showed that chimpanzees are smart and can feel emotions like humans do. Jane Goodall's work changed the way people think about animals and ourselves. When she was a little girl, she was very curious and liked to ask questions. One day, she hid in a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. This might have been the start of her love for animals and her career as a scientist.'

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a job that people dream about when they are young, like being a pilot. But most people grow up and choose more realistic jobs, like being a doctor or a teacher. It's hard to believe that you can make a living by drawing simple pictures. But some people do it. To become a cartoonist, you don't need to go to university, you don't need a lot of money, and you don't even need to be a good artist. You just need to have a brain, a hand, and something to draw with. But it's not easy to be a cartoonist. You need to be very good at drawing and writing. I've done many different types of cartoons, like political cartoons and comic strips. I've also written books and designed things. It's good to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about the world. But the most important thing is to be good at selling your work. Many cartoonists used to have a regular job drawing cartoons for newspapers and magazines. Now, most cartoonists have to sell their own work. If you're good at selling, you will do well. I've seen people who are not very good at drawing but are very good at selling do better than people who are very good at drawing but not very good at selling. Some people are very worried about someone stealing their ideas. But you can protect your work by writing a 'c' in a circle and putting your name and date next to it. If someone steals your cartoon and it becomes popular, it's not the end of the world. It can even be a lucky break!"

Twenty years ago, I moved to a new house and threw away an old electric guitar that my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. I felt bad about getting rid of it, but I thought it was old and useless. A man at the dump asked me if I was going to throw it away. I said yes, but he wanted it. I gave it to him and we went our separate ways. Later, I felt sad about giving it away.
A few months ago, I received an email from a man named Keith. He said he had my old guitar. He found it and thought it was mine because of a name tag on the back. He wanted to sell it back to me. I was so happy to see it again! I was going to give him a lot of money, but he asked for a fair price.
My dad wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I didn't like it. I switched to electric guitar and played simple songs. Now, I'm learning again and it feels great! My fingers remember how to play chords. I might start a band with my son, who plays the saxophone. We could call it ""The Regainers""!

'Sleep is very important for our bodies and minds. When we don't sleep well, we can feel tired, grumpy, and have trouble concentrating. Some people have trouble sleeping and they know how important it is to get a good night's rest. But what about dreams? We don't talk about dreams as much. When we wake up, we often remember our dreams from the last hour or two of sleep. This is because our brains are most active during this time.
Dreams can help us be creative and think in new ways. Some people, like artists and writers, use their dreams to get ideas. They might write or draw something after having a dream. But everyone can use their dreams to think creatively. We all need to be able to think in new ways to solve problems and make good decisions. So, we should take our dreams seriously and try to understand them.'

Classical music is powerful, but not about what we care about. We don't listen to classical music as much anymore. In the past, families made music together, but now we can find any music on the internet. I don't know why people like classical music more when they're older. But if your parents like something, you might not like it. Some people think schools are to blame, but there are kids who like playing classical music in school.

""The book 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in a house and take things from the big people who live there. When I directed a TV show based on the book, I knew it would be hard to make it good. People who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be done. I used the original pictures from the book to help me. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans'. This made filming more difficult. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are 10 times smaller than humans, so we had to film them 10 times further away. When filming the big people, the crew had to crawl on the floor. We never raised the cameras high up except for a few shots. One big problem was making the shadows look right when we combined the tiny Borrowers with big backgrounds. We found a special way to do this. After the show was finished, a famous director, George Lucas, called me to ask how I did it. We built a special set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. It was very strange. The actors had to carry big objects, like giant scissors, and they laughed a lot. We had to stop filming sometimes because they were laughing so much. There's a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. The actors had to go down a tunnel with water and they were very scared. I wanted to get the costumes right. I made them out of thick material so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the actors to move around. They couldn't sit down or take off their clothes. The weather was very hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for the costumes! Most of the action happened away from the Borrowers' home, so we filmed them in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I drew pictures of every scene to show people what it should look like. I drew 2,000 pictures! We had to work fast and hard, and sometimes we made mistakes. But it all worked out in the end, and I think the show was successful."""

'American teenagers have a lot of responsibilities. They are expected to do well in school, have a part-time job, volunteer, and have a social life. They don't have time to just sit around and do nothing. Many people think that teenagers are lazy, but this is not true. They have a lot of work and activities to do. They have homework, tests, and extra activities at school, and they also have to help at home and have a social life. Some people think that teenagers spend too much time on their phones, but this is not always true. Many teenagers use their phones to help them with their work and to stay in touch with their friends and family. Teenagers have a lot of pressure, but they are still able to find time to help others. They volunteer and do things that make a positive difference in their community. In the future, there will be another generation of teenagers who will prove that the negative stereotypes about them are not true.'

It's a fun project that combines science and adventure. I went with them one weekend to help launch a new balloon. They put a special box with a camera, a thermometer, and a GPS tracker on the balloon. The box will float up, up, up until it reaches the edge of space. Then it will come back down and the students will find it using the GPS tracker.
The students were very excited to launch the balloon. They counted down from five and then the balloon went up, up, up. They followed it with flashlights to see it in the sky. It was very quiet and peaceful. The students were amazed by the beauty of the sky.
After the launch, some students went home, but a few stayed to look for shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountain and looked up at the sky. It was very clear and you could see many stars. One student fell asleep in his sleeping bag.
The balloon will come back down to Earth and the students will find it the next day. It might take a long time to get to it because the area is very wild and there are no houses or roads nearby. The students like the adventure of finding the balloon and the box. They have only lost two boxes in 53 launches.
The students are very good at finding the boxes because they know the area well. It took them 11 hours to find this one. It was in a beautiful canyon with a waterfall. The camera didn't take any pictures of shooting stars, but the students were happy to talk about the science of the balloon and the stars.'

Chloe met a famous scientist, Matt Cornelius, who was kind and patient. He helped her understand more about dinosaurs. She was happy to talk to him and learn from him.
People often think that scientists in movies and TV shows are weird or silly. But Chloe says that's not true. Scientists are normal people who work hard to learn about the world. They spend time digging for fossils, studying them, and writing about what they find.
Chloe likes to explain science to people, especially children. She thinks it's important to help them understand and be interested in science. She even helped make a TV show about dinosaurs, called Walking with Dinosaurs. She checked that the dinosaurs shown in the show were accurate and existed at the same time.

They might even fight with each other. Parents try to keep the peace and make sure everyone is safe. Sometimes, they even play tricks on the kids to make them laugh. When you finally arrive at your destination, you know it because the parents get out of the car and go away from the kids. So, if the parents are still near, the answer is 'no, you're not there yet'.""

Jeff had already written a book about his trip around Canada in an old car. He liked cars and bikes and had a job fixing car engines.
Jeff used to ride his bike to work and on holiday to Amsterdam. He liked this. Then he thought, ""Why not travel the world on my bike?"" Jeff didn't want a normal bike. He wanted to build his own. He looked at old penny farthings in a museum to learn how to make one.
Jeff tried to start his trip twice before, but he had to stop because of a knee problem. Finally, in 2006, he started his journey. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part was seeing Mount Everest in Tibet. People were very surprised to see him ride a penny farthing.
Jeff had some hard times, like when he had to drink dirty water from a stream and got sick. He was in bed for 10 days without medicine. But he didn't regret his trip. If he could, he would do it again tomorrow.'

We've been studying ducks in different places, and I've had to take a boat to some sites and write down what I see. The weather has been tricky - some nights are warm, but most are cold and rainy.

Some customers are surprised at how much flowers cost, and I have to ask them to think again about what they want. I like making the nicest flowers for the money customers want to spend.

'Research is an important part of studying and working. It's not just for experts or famous scientists. Research is a way to find out new things and solve problems. You can do research in many areas, like science, history, or even your daily life.
As a student, you can contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers. You don't just repeat what you learn, you make it. Research is about asking ""Why?"", ""How?"", and ""What if?"" and trying to find the answers.
Research can be simple or complex. It can be a big project or a small investigation. You might do research for a school project or to solve a problem in your daily life. For example, you might research how to fix a broken toy or how to grow a plant.
In college and university, you are expected to think critically and ask questions. You need to evaluate the information you read and hear, and make your own decisions. You should not just accept what others say without thinking about it.
It's important to be careful when reading and listening to information. You need to think about whether it's true or not, and whether it makes sense. You should not just believe everything you're told.'

""Cities have always been important for learning and creativity. People have gathered in cities to discuss new ideas and make art. However, city life can be very challenging. The same places where people gather to talk and create can also spread diseases. Some famous artists, like Pablo Picasso, left the city to live in the countryside.
Scientists have studied how cities affect our brains. They found that cities can make our brains work less well. One reason is that we don't have enough nature around us. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their hospital windows get better faster. Even just looking at nature for a little while can help our brains work better.
Many people now live in cities, which is a big change from the past. Instead of living in the countryside, we are surrounded by many people and buildings. This can affect our mental and physical health. Our brains have to work hard to deal with all the things we see and hear in the city. This can make us feel tired and stressed.
Scientists have found that natural places can help our brains work better. They call this 'attention restoration theory.' This means that when we are in nature, our brains can relax and rest. This is important because our brains are like powerful computers that need to rest sometimes.
For a long time, people have known that our attention is limited. We can only focus on one thing at a time. Natural places can help us focus better. They can also help us feel calm and happy.
Some cities have big parks where people can go to relax and enjoy nature. These parks can help our brains work better. People have been looking for ways to improve their brains for a long time, but it seems that taking a walk in nature might be one of the best ways.
So, why do cities continue to grow? Cities can be good for our brains because they bring people together. This can lead to new ideas and creativity. The key is to find a balance between the good and bad things about cities.""

Where should we look for our thoughts? Some people think that thinking happens only in our heads. But I think that's not true. Our thoughts are connected to the things around us. We use things to help us think and learn. This is true from the earliest times to now.
We often think that our minds are just in our brains. But our brains are connected to our bodies and the things we use. For example, a blind person uses a stick to help them see. The stick becomes a part of their body.
Our minds are not finished. They change and grow as we use new things. This is what makes us human. We use things to help us understand the world and to make sense of it. This is why we make things, and why those things make our minds what they are.
I think we should think about how things help us think and learn. This is important for understanding how our minds work."

People liked photography because it was a new and exciting technology. It was like having a magic window to the world. You could take pictures of anything and anyone. This was important for people who wanted to show who they were and what they looked like.
Photography was also important for families. It helped them remember special moments and events. The camera was like a magic box that could capture memories.
Photographs are special because they show what is real. They are not like drawings or paintings, which are made by people. Photographs are like a record of what happened. They can show us things that are important, like people, places, and events.
But photographs can also be tricky. They can mean different things to different people. The meaning of a photograph can change depending on where it is shown and who looks at it.
In the past, artists used to keep the camera a secret. But now, many artists use photographs in their work. They use them to create new and interesting things. Photography is now an important part of art and culture.

'William James was an American philosopher and doctor who lived a long time ago. He said that psychology is the study of the mind. This is still true today. We all have a mind and we know what it means. But it's hard to understand because it's not like a machine that we can see and touch. 
Psychologists try to find out about the mind by studying how people behave. They want to know why people do things and how they feel. They also try to figure out what is true and what is just a person's opinion. 
It's hard to study the mind because it's not like a machine. We can't see what's going on inside our heads. So, psychologists have to use other ways to learn about the mind. They watch how people behave and make guesses about what's going on inside their heads. 
Psychology is like trying to solve a puzzle. They have to look at clues and figure out what they mean. They have to be careful and use good reasons to make their guesses. 
Psychologists want to help people understand themselves and others better. They want to help people learn new things and make better choices. They have already helped us in many ways, like teaching children to read and making machines safer. 
A long time ago, psychologists used to try to understand the mind by thinking about their own thoughts and feelings. But now, they prefer to study how other people behave and think. This helps them make better guesses about what's going on in people's minds.'

'There is a special place in Michigan, USA, where they keep old products that nobody wanted to buy. It's called the Museum of Failed Products. The owner, Carol Sherry, thinks each product has its own sad story about why it didn't sell. Most people think that big companies would have their own collection of failed products, but they don't. The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath, who wanted to collect new products. He didn't know that most products don't sell. He thought he was collecting a reference library, but he ended up with mostly failed products.
People might think that companies would learn from their mistakes and not make the same ones again. But often, they don't talk about their failures. They might even spend more money on a product that doesn't work to make it look like it was a good idea. This is because people like to be optimistic and focus on the good things.
Some people think that if you think positively, good things will happen. But research shows that thinking about how well things could go actually makes people less motivated to work hard to achieve their goals. A psychologist named Gabriele Oettingen found that when people think about how well they will do, they actually do worse.
Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, thinks that people's experiences of failure depend on what they believe about their abilities. Some people think that abilities are fixed, and that failure means they're not good enough. Others believe that abilities can be developed through hard work and practice. Dweck says that people who believe abilities can be developed are happier and do better in the long run.'

**Title:** Why do sports teams do better at home?
**Text:**
Many people think that sports teams do better when they play at home. But why is this? Scientists and money people want to know the answer. They want to know what makes players play their best. Some people think that playing at home is not as important as it used to be. Long ago, teams used to win a lot more at home than they do now.
Some experts think that home advantage is because of the crowd. When the crowd cheers, it can make the players feel more confident and strong. But, some research shows that this might not be true. In one study, referees watched a game with and without crowd noise. They found that the referees were more likely to make decisions that helped the home team when they heard the crowd noise.
Other experts think that home advantage is because of the players' feelings. They feel more comfortable and safe at home. This can help them play better. But, some sports, like baseball, don't have as much home advantage as others, like basketball.
One more idea is that home advantage is because of something deep inside us. It's like a feeling of protection for our home. This feeling can make us want to do better and fight harder when we're at home.
**Questions:**
1. Why do people think sports teams do better at home?
2. What do scientists and money people want to know about home advantage?
3. Why do you think the crowd cheering might help the players?
4. What did the referees find out in the study about crowd noise?
5. Why might home advantage be different in different sports?

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at level A1:
'Practice makes perfect' is a famous saying that many athletes use. But what does it really mean? The golfer Gary Player said this a long time ago, but people still argue about what he meant. Some people think it means that the more you practice, the luckier you get. But Gary Player meant the opposite: the more you practice, the better you get.
This idea is important in sports, music, and other areas where people try to be good at something. A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert in a field. Many people agree with this idea.
But not everyone agrees. A writer named Epstein thinks that there is more to it. He says that some people are just naturally good at things, and that practice can only take them so far. He looked at many examples, including dog sled racing in Alaska, to understand how people become good at things.
Epstein thinks that there are two parts to being good at something: 'hardware' (what you are born with) and'software' (what you learn). He says that both are important, but that 'hardware' can be more important in some cases. He also talks about how men and women are different and how this affects sports.

Some children in rich countries are unhappy. They feel lonely and out of place. A writer named Jay Griffiths thinks she knows why. She says that these children spend too much time inside, looking at screens, and don't play outside. This is the problem. She thinks that children need to be outside, in nature, to be happy.
A study talked to some children and found that they wanted to go outside more. Many adults remember when they were young and spent a lot of time playing outside. They think it was better than today.
Griffiths writes that parents are worried about dangers outside and keep their children inside. This helps toy and game companies make more money. She also writes about strange rules that some schools have, like making children wear goggles to play.
Griffiths thinks that children should be free to play outside and take risks. She says that children need to learn to be careful by having small accidents. But she doesn't say how to make this happen. Some people think that not all children want to play outside. Some are shy and like to stay inside.

'I'm a scientist who studies how children learn. I think that school is not the best way for children to learn. Children learn by playing. Playing is important for children because it helps them learn to think, work with others, and control their feelings. When children play, they use their imagination and creativity. These are important skills for adults too. Adults who are good at solving problems and thinking creatively are often called geniuses. One famous genius, Albert Einstein, said that he learned by playing and imagining.
Children are born to play. They play with other children to learn how to be kind and fair. Play is special because it's voluntary. Children can choose to stop playing if they want to. This makes play a democratic activity. Unfortunately, children don't have as much time to play as they used to. They have less time for breaks and more homework. Adults often supervise children's play, which takes away from their freedom to make choices.
I think children need more playtime, not more school. We should let children play and explore, so they can grow up to be strong and smart adults.'

'Many young people in their twenties are using social media to look for a job. They can use websites like Twitter and LinkedIn to talk to people who might be able to help them find a job. But it's important to be careful. A young job seeker in the US contacted a important person on LinkedIn, but the person was not happy. She didn't like the way the young person asked for help and sent a mean message. This made a lot of people unhappy. 
The incident shows that social media can be a bad tool for job hunting if you don't know how to use it. Many young people are making mistakes on social media. They are used to using social media for fun, but it's different when you're looking for a job. 
When you use social media for work, you need to be professional. Don't send a message that is too friendly or too formal. Just be clear and polite. Explain who you are and what you can do for the person you're contacting. This will help you get a good response. Remember, social media can be a good way to find a job, but you need to use it carefully.'

Newspapers are in trouble. Many people think they will disappear soon. But newspapers have survived before. They were once new media, and it took a long time for them to become popular.
In the past, people didn't need news every day. They only got news when something important happened. Now, we expect to know what's happening all the time.
Newspapers used to be the only way to get news. But now, we have the internet. We can get news whenever we want, and we can choose what we want to read.
Some people think newspapers will disappear because they can't compete with the internet. But newspapers can still be useful. They can help us understand the world and make sense of things.
We used to get news in the marketplace or tavern. People would share stories and rumors. Sometimes, the news was true, and sometimes it wasn't. Now, we have the internet, and we can get accurate information quickly.
Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works. Maybe they will disappear. Or maybe they will find a new way to help us understand the world.

Here is a simplified version of the text for A1 level learners:
If we were meant to live in the dark, we would be happy in the dark. But we're not. We're creatures that need sunlight to see. This is because our bodies are adapted to live in the sun's light. We don't think about this much, but it's true. We've made the night brighter by using artificial light. This is like controlling a river. It has good and bad effects. The bad effect is called light pollution.
Light pollution is when we use too much light and it shines into the sky. This is bad for many living things, including us. It changes the way they live and can even hurt them. In the past, people didn't use as much artificial light, so light pollution wasn't a problem. Imagine walking in London at night a long time ago. It was very dark, and you could only see a little light from candles and lanterns.
We've made the night bright like a country without people. But many animals are active at night, and light is very important to them. Some birds are even attracted to artificial light and can get hurt. Light pollution also affects our bodies. We need darkness to sleep and wake up at the right times. If we don't get enough darkness, we can get sick.
We've forgotten how important darkness is. We need it to be healthy and happy. We should remember that we're part of the natural world and that the stars and the rhythm of day and night are important to us. If we don't, we might forget who we are and where we fit in the universe.

'A big company has decided not to keep track of how much holiday time its employees take. This idea came from a smaller internet company that already does this. The company's boss says that employees can take as much holiday as they want, as long as they are sure it won't harm the business. But is this a good idea?
The company is very big, with many different departments and many employees. It's hard to know if this idea will work in such a big company. In a smaller company, employees know each other's work and can easily check if someone is away. In a big company, it's harder to know if someone's absence will cause problems.
The boss says that employees can take holiday as long as they are sure their work is done and their colleagues are not affected. But it's hard to be sure about this. Even if you prepare well, there is always more work to do when you come back. This can make people feel stressed and guilty.
In the past, people had a certain amount of holiday time guaranteed by law. This helped them feel safe and relaxed when they took holiday. Without this, people might feel they can't take holiday, or they might feel guilty for taking it. This could lead to problems in the workplace.
Technology has changed the way we work. We can work from anywhere and at any time. This can make it hard to separate work and leisure time. The internet company started this policy because they wanted to find a way to balance work and leisure time. But this policy might have some problems too. Employees might feel like they are always working, even when they are not at work. This can be bad for their mental and physical health.
I'm not sure if this policy is a good idea. Workers need time off to rest and relax. This is important for their health and well-being. I'm not sure if unlimited holiday time will really make people happier and more productive.'"

""Journal-based peer review is the process of checking a scientific research paper by experts in the same field. It's like a filter that helps make sure the paper is good and correct. Some people think it's very important, but it can take a long time, up to a year. Is it worth it? Yes and no. The way we publish scientific papers is changing. Some people are using preprints, which are early versions of a paper that are shared online before they are officially published. This helps get new results out quickly so others can read, criticize, and build on them.
Publishing in top journals is important for scientists, but it can be a competition. Some scientists might not be honest and leave out important information to get published. Reviewers also have to decide if a paper is good enough for a top journal, which can be hard. The problem is that too few people are willing to change the system.
One scientist, Ron Vale, thinks preprints could be a solution. Preprints are not peer-reviewed, but they are open to comments and discussion. This means that readers can see the comments and decide for themselves. Some scientists have tried this and found it helpful.
Preprints can also help share negative results, which are important for science. And, they get more attention and are cited more often. By using the internet and remembering the old way of sharing ideas, preprints can help scientists focus on the work itself, not just where it's published.""

'When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a picture made with words. But I don't think this is a good answer. So, I asked my students to write two paragraphs about an object. One paragraph should describe the object like a scientist would, and the other paragraph should be from the object's point of view, like it's talking to us. One student wrote about an oxygen mask. This was a strange choice, but it helped us understand what poetry is. Poetry is special because it can make us think about things in a new way.
When I was at school, poetry seemed hard to understand. I thought it was like a puzzle that got in the way of feeling and understanding. But now I think poetry can be helpful. It can make us think about our feelings and emotions. Sometimes, poems can be short and simple, but they can also be long and complicated. We might not always understand them, but that's okay. Poetry is special because it can surprise us and make us think about things in a new way. It's like a secret message that only we can understand.'

'I bought my first metal detector when I got married. It was a lot of money, but my wife was impressed when I found a gold ring on my first trip. I've been looking for treasures ever since. It took 40 years for me to find something that impressed my wife again. One rainy day, I was searching for old things in a field. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a wheel. Then it beeped again. I was curious and dug deeper. After a while, I saw a shiny, golden ball. I thought it might be a treasure. When I cleaned it, it became a beautiful, golden necklace. I knew it was very old and valuable. I took it to the museum, and they confirmed it was a special necklace from a long time ago. They sold it to the council, and we got a lot of money.

I love sleeping when I travel. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a little guilty. When my friends plan their trips and tell me about all the things they want to do, I smile and don't say much. My trips are different. I like to have time to sleep and relax. When I visited Mexico, I slept a lot. It was nice to sleep in a new place and feel safe.
I think sleep is an important part of traveling. When we travel, we see and experience new things. We hear new sounds, smell new smells, and feel new feelings. Sleep helps us process all of these new things. It's like our brain is cleaning up and making sense of everything we've seen and done.
Sleep is also different in different places. In some places, people sleep at different times than we do. In Trinidad, people wake up early and sleep a lot in the middle of the day. It takes me a few days to get used to this. When I finally sleep like the locals, I feel like I'm really part of the place.
Sleep is also a way to connect with the place we're visiting. When I sleep in a new place, I remember the sounds and smells of that place. It's like my brain is storing up memories of my trip.
I think I should be proud of my love of sleep when I travel. It's a way to really experience and enjoy a new place. Maybe I'll tell my friends about it and they'll understand why I love sleeping when I travel.

But it was a big success! It helped me make other projects, like a book about my restaurant. In each project, I go on a journey, like into the past, into my own mind, or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books called ""Perfection"". In these books, I travel to different places to meet special people who make food. They have been working hard to make their food perfect. Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the book was hard, and I knew I would make some people unhappy. But I worked with my team to find a list that everyone could like. This made me think that each person has their own idea of what is perfect. It's a mix of feelings, memories, and where they are from. The book is not about saying that my recipes are the best, but about understanding what makes good food. The TV show helped me try new foods, meet new people, and explore new places. I was excited about that. I went to many places to find the best ingredients. It was fun, but sometimes it was also a little difficult. For example, I went to a tomato factory that wasn't making the right kind of tomatoes, and I had to stop filming at a dairy farm because it wasn't perfect.

Lucy didn't want to be at the festival. She didn't even apply, but her mom did. Lucy's mom said she didn't want Lucy to be sad if she didn't get in. But Lucy thought her mom just didn't want her to say no. The man from Tokyo asked Lucy if she had been to Japan, and she said yes, when she was 8. Then Lucy's grandfather came and took her away to talk to other important people. Lucy smiled and nodded, but didn't really listen to what they said.
After the party, Lucy's grandfather said she did well and was proud of her. He said everyone at the festival knows who she is. Lucy liked being someone important, even if some people are jealous or think she's too young. Being a good pianist doesn't make her popular at school, but at the festival, she knows she matters.

'Dad says it's not good to spend too much time online. I decided to find out what experts say. They think that most teenagers who use social media have many friends, feel good about themselves, and learn important skills. Simon Miles, an expert, says that social media is a part of modern life for teenagers. It's like hanging out with friends, but online. Jim Matthews, another expert, says it's like a virtual youth club where teenagers can share jokes and gossip, and learn to deal with problems and make friends.
Professor Keith Davidson says that social media can help teenagers figure out who they are and what they like. It's like a big scrapbook where you can share your interests and see what others like. Research shows that teenagers who use social media are not as selfish as those who don't. Professor Andrew Phillips thinks that social media can help shy people connect with others who have the same interests. Pauline White, an expert in digital education, says that teenagers can use social media to find new hobbies, join groups, and even create their own content. This can help them in the future when they go to work.
Teenagers who use social media in a creative way will have an advantage when they grow up. They can work with others to create something and share it with others. This is an important skill in the 21st century, and it will help them in their future careers.'

'When my family went on holiday, my parents didn't want to relax. They planned a big trip across nine American states and one Canadian province. My brother and I were not happy about it. We packed our bags and set off on a long car journey. We went through Oklahoma and saw many interesting things. We had to stop for the night in a small town and saw many stars in the sky. The next day, we drove to the mountains. We walked in the sand dunes and visited a town with a strong smell of sulfur. We saw old and new things everywhere. We had to be careful on the roads and saw many wind farms. We went to Yellowstone National Park and saw bears. We even saw one on the road! We stayed in a hotel without internet or phone, but it was nice because we could see beautiful views. After a rainy day, we went back home. My parents were right - we can find amazing things close to home.'

'Gareth, our teacher, said, ""Speed is your friend, not your enemy."" We looked down the big hill. David, who had experience, went first. He went fast and jumped high. But he fell down and lost his skis. ""Speed is unpredictable,"" Gareth said.
I like skiing, but I'm not good at freestyle. I've never done tricks on a ramp or half pipe. I thought it would be fun, but I was worried I would fall. My parents wanted us to go to a special place in the US for freestyle skiing. It had a big indoor area with trampolines and fake snow. Students would jump and try new tricks. After practicing, they would go outside to try again.
Gareth said, ""Progression is inevitable!"" He meant that people used to just go down the hill and hope for the best. But now, we can practice and learn. He told us to remember the ""knuckle"" - the flat part behind the jump. If we land on the knuckle, we will stop and it will hurt.
I found it hard to go fast and jump. My legs would stop moving and I would fall. I didn't fall, but I was very tired. Gareth said, ""You need to control the jump, not let it control you.""
The next day, we went to the trampolines. I thought it would be boring, but it was fun! We did some exercises to help us jump better. Gareth gave us feedback. I need to work on my ""aerial awareness"" - knowing what I'm doing when I'm in the air. We went back to the mountain to try again. It took some time, but I finally landed properly. I was very happy. But then I lost my skis again!'

'Imagine you're on a rollercoaster. You feel scared and excited. The rollercoaster stops and then goes up slowly. Then it goes down quickly and you feel your stomach in the air. You might scream. But you chose to go on the rollercoaster, and many people do every year. Amusement parks are a big business. They need many people to make sure the rides are safe and fun. These people are engineers, designers, and experts. They make sure the rollercoasters are exciting but not too scary. They also make sure the ride is fun and new. 
Rollercoaster designers are very important. They have to make sure the ride is safe and fun. They have to make it exciting but not too scary. They also have to make it new and different. They work hard to make the best ride. They test the ride before it opens to the public. 
Some people think that new technology, like virtual reality, will change the way rollercoasters work. But one of the experts said that the physical rollercoaster will always be the best. People will always want to ride a real rollercoaster.'

'Miranda Ellington is a 25-year-old choreographer. She creates dance performances for many theatres and dance companies. She still dances sometimes too. I'm curious why she does both. 'When I dance again, I remember what it's like to be in a dance studio and take orders from a choreographer. It can be tense and frustrating. As a choreographer, Miranda teaches dance to young students. She likes working with them because they are open to new ideas and willing to try new things. They don't know what they're good at or not good at yet, so they listen to her suggestions. When she works with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She tries to make the best dance routine she can, even if she doesn't like the music. Sometimes, dancers don't like the music either, but she has to find a way to make it work. Miranda likes to work with different people and companies. She doesn't like to stay with just one place. She has to adapt to each new place she works with. She thinks it's important to be open to new ideas and not get too used to one way of working. Miranda was happy to see a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. She thinks it showed a realistic view of what it's like to be a dancer. She thinks people don't understand how hard it is to be a dancer. A good dance production is when everything comes together - the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers. It's not always perfect, but it's good to aim high. Miranda has done many different types of dance performances. She doesn't want to be known just for one type of dance. She wants to try new things and learn from others.'

'I have a friend who asked me why I travel when I can watch TV at home. I said that TV is okay, but there's nothing like experiencing things in person. This made me think of a crazy idea. My friend was getting rid of his old sofa, so I decided to take it on a trip. I fixed the sofa and attached seatbelts to my shoulders. I slept on the sofa every night, even on the beach one night. Some friends joined me and helped me pull the sofa along the road. This was a new adventure for me. I walked a long way, and it was nice to stop at a café and relax on the sofa with a coffee. When people ask me about my weekend, I like to tell them about my sofa trip instead of talking about TV shows. You can see the film about my trip on my website.'

'I read about a group swimming trip in the sea around some small Greek islands. I was excited because I'd never done a group trip before. My brother couldn't come, so I decided to join a group. The man at the port was surprised when I asked for a single ticket, but I told him I would be with a group of ten people. He showed me on the boat and I met my new friends. We had talked a bit before we started, but not much. Our guides told us about a support boat that would be with us the whole time and how to talk to it. We did a short swim to get everyone going at the same speed. Then we did a longer swim, 1.5 km. I was a little nervous because I'd never swum so far in the sea before. The waves got bigger and I was swimming slowly. I watched the faster swimmers ahead of me and wanted to keep up. I was happy when I finished the first swim. The next days were the same: we got in the water, swam at a good speed, and stopped to look at the beautiful islands. As we swam farther, I got faster and happier. We didn't need the support boat much. I can't wait to go again next year.'

'I like being a flight attendant. I travel a lot and meet new people. I have a lot of free time and my job is never boring. When I was a child, I used to travel alone to school and sometimes helped the flight attendants with food. This made me happy. When I was unhappy with my old job, I started looking for a new one. I went to an interview and told them about my strengths and experience. I got the job! I like being a flight attendant because I get to meet new people, have time off, and don't have to work too much. Sometimes I have to deal with difficult passengers, but it's okay because it's only for a short time.'

'I work at a summer camp. I like seeing the children do things they never thought they could do. Most children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here. But rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel scared, but after we encourage them, they try and they all reach the top. This makes them very happy. Some children miss their homes at first. It's not the little ones who miss their homes the most, but the children between 10 and 13 years old. We don't let them use their phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch, and then after dinner, we say it's too late. Most children are fine after a few days. At the end of their stay, they all thank us because they had a great time. Sometimes, not just the children feel lonely. We get parents who call us all the time, asking about their child. This is not necessary. Sometimes, their child is busy playing or doing something else, so we ask the parents to call back later. We get some children who wear expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we tell them to change into something more suitable, but they understand why soon.'"

'Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London. It was very popular in the USA, where it was called the 'Best Musical' four times! But it was hard to find actors in the UK because they can only do a few shows a week. In the USA, they can do more. The director found many good actors in the UK, and they won their first 'Best Musical' award. The theatre in London is big, and it's always full. People want to hear the songs that were popular in America. I met an 11-year-old actor named Jamie. He's very happy to play his guitar and get paid for it. He goes to school at the theatre and misses his old friends. His whole class came to see the show, and they loved it. Jamie's parents come to see him when they can, but it's expensive. Jamie showed me his guitar and we played a song together. He's very good! The young actors were already good musicians, but they had never played in a band before. They found it easy to play together, but at first, they forgot to smile when they performed. The show will be in London for another year, and it's worth seeing.'
